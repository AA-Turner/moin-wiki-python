''Jython, lest you do not know of it, is the most compelling weapon the Java platform has for its survival into the 21st century - SeanMcGrath''




----

== Why Jython ==


There are numerous alternative languages implemented for the Java VM. The following features help to separate Jython from the rest:

 * Dynamic compilation to Java bytecodes - leads to highest possible performance without sacrificing interactivity.
 * Ability to extend existing Java classes in Jython - allows effective use of abstract classes.
 * Optional static compilation - allows creation of applets, servlets, beans, ...
 * Bean Properties - make use of Java packages much easier.
 * Python Language - combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It also supports a full object-oriented programming model which makes it a natural fit for Java's OO design. 


== What Does Jython Do Well? ==

  * Prototyping
  * Java investigation
    {{{
    >>> from java.util import Date
    >>> d = Date()
    >>> print d
    Sat Jan 08 16:26:16 CST 2005
    >>> from java.util import Random
    >>> print dir(Random)
    ['__init__', 'nextBoolean', 'nextBytes', 'nextDouble', 'nextFloat',
    'nextGaussian', 'nextInt', 'nextLong', 'seed', 'setSeed']
    >>>
    }}}

  
  * Making bean properties accessible
    {{{
    >>> print Date().time
    1105500911121
    }}}

  * Glues together libraries already written in Java
  * Excellent embedded scripting language
    *  Object Domain UML Tool
    *  PushToTest
    *  Drools

== Differences - Python & Jython ==

'''Python'''
  * C
  * Multi-platform
  * Compiles to .pyc
  * Extend with C
  * GIL [[FootNote(Global Interpreter Lock, explained in [http://docs.python.org/api/threads.html Python documentation, chapter 8.1])]]
  * Python Garbage Collection

'''Jython'''
  * 100% Java
  * Any JVM (currently 1.1+)
  * Compiles to .class
  * Extend with Java
  * Truly multi-threaded
  * Java garbage collection
