== Code Speedup Experiments ==

This is a log of the speed up experiments that we are conducting.


Here are some experiments we could conduct. For each, we would compare against a pure Python implementation:
Fib hand optimized to Java, no frames or other call setup support as seen in {{{PyBaseCode}}}.
      * Fib pure Python, but with indy.
      * Nested loops. Array multiplication?
      * Guard failure of a loop, call into interpreter ({{{PyBytecode}}}) with well-known offset and synthesized frame. (Limited CPS.)
      * Etc

=== Related Speedups ===
Before venturing into these experiments, I tried to speedup the {{{PyByteCode}}}. You can view the page on that at PyByteCodeSpeedups

All the work is being done at a mercurial repo at [[http://bitbucket.org/shashank/jython-experiments/]]
