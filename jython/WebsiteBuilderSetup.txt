Jython uses reStructuredText and a custom writer to build its site.  This describes how to set it up.

  1. Download and install [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ docutils].  Grab it from the site and go through the normal 'python setup.py install' deal.  Note that a docutils egg will '''NOT''' work here (possibly pending some packaging changes to jysite).
  1. Grab the site builder out of svn and install it.
   {{{
svn co https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/trunk/sandbox/wierzbicki/jysite
cd jysite
python setup.py install}}}
  1. Check out the actual website code from `https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/trunk/website`
  1. Make sure a Jython trunk checkout is available as `jython` at the same level as `website`.

Now you can build the site using Ant.  Change into your checkout directory and run `ant` to build the site.  The reStructuredText files that comprise most of the site are in the `Project` directory.

To deploy the site:

 1.  Run `ant copy2sf` to build a tar.bz2 of the site and scp it to sourceforge
 1.  `ssh shell.sourceforge.net`
 1.  Unpack the site
{{{
cd /home/groups/j/jy/jython/htdocs
tar xfj ../website.tar.bz2}}}

You'll want to have `umask 002` and `newgrp jython` in your .bash_login so the site is updatable by others as well.
