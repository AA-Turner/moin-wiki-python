'''Contents''' [[TableOfContents]]

== Installation ==

To start the 2.2a1 installation, please proceed as follows:
 * download the jython_Release_2_2alpha1.jar file and save it locally ([http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12867 Download from sourceforge])
 * double-click the file jython_Release_2_2alpha1.jar, or type: `java -jar jython_Release_2_2alpha1.jar`    
This will bring up the GUI installer ([http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ohumbel/install-22a1.html Screen shots]).

On true headless systems, the installer will automatically switch to console mode.
You can force console mode using the `-console` switch:
 * `java -jar jython_Release_2_2alpha1.jar -console`
 

== Generation of start scripts ==

On Windows, the installer creates a `jython.bat` and a `jythonc.bat` file. On all other platforms, it creates a `jython` and `jythonc` file, which are unix like shell scripts.
If these scripts are not executable, please grant the permission on os system level.

Please let us know if you need different scripts on different platforms.

 
== Troubleshooting ==

If one of the GUI steps should appear empty, or with no text visible: Please try to press '''Previous''' and then '''Next''' again.

The GUI which appears when pressing the '''Browse''' button in selecting the target directory might be a bit confusing. Some tips and tricks:

 * it uses the standard {{{javax.swing.JFileChooser}}}
 * opening and selecting of a directory: there are different looks and feels on different platforms - just play a little to get used to yours
 * the icon for creation of a new directory is sometimes greyed out, although java would have the rights to create one. If this happens, select the parent directory and then try to type in the name of the new directory in the input field. The installer then will create the new directory, if possible

If all else fails, try using  console mode.


== A sample console session ==

This is a transcript from a Windows XP machine, using MKS Korn Shell in Emacs. It doesn't look much different when using cmd.exe:

== What will be different on the HEAD version ==

 * enables silent installation, without user interaction
 * enables selection of a different java runtime for the start scripts
 * start scripts are made executable by the installer
 * better help and usage

A preview of the usage:
{{{
usage:
       java -jar jython_HEAD.jar [-s | -c] [-d dir] [-h | -?] [-t type] [-j dir]

the following options are available:
 -?                     print this help/usage.
 -c,--console           do a console based installation (with user
                        interaction).
 -d,--directory <dir>   target directory to install to;
                        required if in silent mode;
                        ignored if not in silent mode.
 -h,--help              print this help/usage.
 -j,--jre <dir>         home directory of the runtime jre, or jdk;
                        executables are assumed in the /bin subdirectory;
                        ignored if not in silent mode.
 -s,--silent            do a silent installation (without user interaction).
 -t,--type <type>       installation type: all, standard or minimum;
                        ignored if not in silent mode.

no option at all will start the interactive GUI installer.
