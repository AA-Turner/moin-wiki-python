* Submit all patches to the [http://jython.org/patches/ Jython Patch Tracker]
* The patch should be a single unified diff file, not several diffs or a tar or zip containing several diffs.  The easiest way to produce this is by running svn diff in your checkout.  Make all the changes necessary to fix the bug or add the feature you're working on.  svn add any files that need to be added and svn rm any files that need to be removed.  Then run 'svn diff > patch_name.diff' in the root of your checkout.  If there are changes in your checkout that aren't part of the patch, just pass the files that should be included in the diff explicitly to svn diff.
* If the patch is to fix a bug already in the bug tracker, include the bug number in your comment.
* Be sure to run regrtest and the bugtests as described in the JythonDeveloperGuide and mention that in your comments.
* If the functionality changed by the patch isn't well tested by existing tests, new tests should be included that exercise the functionality.  See the unittests in Lib/test that are run by regrtest as examples of how to write a new test.
