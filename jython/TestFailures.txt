= Failing tests on the 2.3 branch =

== Ones with reasons ==

test_binascii: exceptions are strings, not classes, so issubclass() raises an exception;
a2b_qp not implemented; a2b_uu has a logic error that makes it fail on 
the UUencoding of an empty string.

test_StringIO: root cause: ''.join([unicode, str]) returns str, should be unicode

test_dumbdbm: with very large strings, the value retrieved is incorrect.

test_format: '%d' % '1' works, should raise a TypeError.

test_fileinput: patch in SF.
