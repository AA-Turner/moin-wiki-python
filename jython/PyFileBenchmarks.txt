Some PyFile benchmarks, mostly to show off the PyFile nio rewrite

Tests done on FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, Java 1.5.0_13 in server mode and Python 2.5.1

(If anyone's worried about FreeBSD Java, the times are in line with OS X's Java 1.5)

Preparations: 100
Iterations: 5

Notes:

* jython's file iter is roughly equivalent to its readline, whereas CPython's readline is not as optimized as its iter

* The few anomalies in the smaller benchmarks are probably due to hotspot kicking in. Ideally we would run more preparations

* why is read slower than iter? seems like a lot of time is spent in allocating the ByteBuffer whereas iter uses a pre-allocated, small one.
