Welcome to our Jython's IRC community! Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python written in 100% Pure Java, and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus allows you to run Python on any Java platform. Join us in [[irc://irc.freenode.net/jython|#jython]] at Freenode.net and make Jython better.
