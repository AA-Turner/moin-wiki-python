Pylons (0.9.6.1) on Jython Requirements/TODO
============================================

Installing Pylons and its dependencies
--------------------------------------

  * distutils and setuptools **(Mostly finished, See** `SetuptoolsOnJython`_ **)**

  * Ensure all dependencies' tests pass

nose
----

Pylons projects require nose, but most packages (including Pylons) use nose as their own test runners.

requires:

  * the optparse module **(added in r4018)**

  * a fix for the cell variable (variables used in closures) bug here: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/667 **(fixed in r4038)**

  * compiler modules (compiler requires the parser module which Jython lacks). nose only needs the compiler module to use compiler.consts.CO_GENERATOR; until there's a parser, maybe jython could provide a broken compiler module that doesn't import parser

Routes
------
Pretty much all tests pass: though some tests require Paste's paste.fixture, which is troublesome to import


Paste, PasteDeploy and PasteScript
----------------------------------
requires:

  * modulefinder module

Mako
----

  * mako uses the compiler module to parse Python code into AST. The compiler module is mostly pure Python code, but its guts are really the native parser module (which Jython lacks)

Beaker
------

WebHelpers
----------

FormEncode
----------

simplejson
----------

  * `SetuptoolsOnJython`_ currently has trouble installing simplejson, because it attempts to compile its optional C extensions (that help performance). It expects to catch a distutils.errors.CCompilerError if the compilation fails, but Jython dies much earlier:

  File "/Users/pjenvey/src/java/jython-trunk/dist/Lib/distutils/command/build_ext.py", line 598, in get_ext_filename

  TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects

decorator
---------

  * Note: decorators aren't currently supported in Jython, however the decorator module doesn't actually use decorators (works on CPython 2.3)

Later down the road
===================


SQLAlchemy
----------

  - The [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/672 Dialect Refactor II] ticket will need to be implemented to properly support using SQLAlchemy via Jython's DBAPI jdbc driver, [http://jython.org/Project/userguide.html#database-connectivity-in-jython zxJDBC].
  - Frank Wierzbicki has done some preliminary work on using SQLAlchemy with Jython, info [http://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy/browse_frm/thread/d60db24fe1683a41/09320033f406d78b?hl=en&lnk=gst here], and is scheduled to give a talk at PyCon 2008: "Database development with Jython, SQLAlchemy, and Hibernate"
