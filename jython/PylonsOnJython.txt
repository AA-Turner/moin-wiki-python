Pylons on Jython
================

**Status**: `Jython is supported as of Pylons 0.9.7 <http://pylonshq.com/docs/en/0.9.7/jython/>`_

Pending Improvements
====================

Support more of the out of the box optional components, such as: 

SQLAlchemy
----------

See `SqlAlchemyOnJython`_

Jinja2
------

Jinja2 `may work on Jython now <http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/jinja/ticket/320>`_. Its tests need to be converted to nosetests so the test suite can run on Jython to ensure this

Genshi
------
Jim Baker and Ariane Paola have played around with Genshi on Jython. Its use of pyexpat is the biggest roadblock. Jython now includes a pyexpat, but it's not fully compatible with CPython's (and doesn't support all the features Genshi uses).

Turbogears 2
------------

Ariane Paola made some progress porting TurboGears 2 components to Jython for Google's Summer of Code. Genshi and SQLAlchemy are the most important pieces that need porting
