Pylons on Jython
================

**Status**: Jython is supported as of Pylons 0.9.7.

Pending Improvements
====================

bdist_war: Need the ability to create .war files from a Pylons project, similar to what django-jython provides. pjenvey is working on this

Support more of the out of the box optional components, such as: 

SQLAlchemy
----------

 * Frank Wierzbicki, Ariane Paoao and others have made some progress making SQLAlchemy work with MySQL via zxJDBC, but no support in SQLAlchemy proper yet.

 * Jonathan Ellis made an Oracle backend for SQLAlchemy via zxJDBC: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/77c3184b14d6936d86d13e4e65df92d2 Some other zxJDBC dialects would likely follow this example

 * The `Dialect Refactor II <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/672>`_ ticket will help properly support using SQLAlchemy via Jython's DBAPI jdbc driver, `zxJDBC <http://jython.org/Project/userguide.html#database-connectivity-in-jython>`_. Jason Kirtland has begun working on this.

Jinja2
------

Jinja2 `may work on Jython now <http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/jinja/ticket/320>`_. Its tests need to be converted to nosetests so the test suite can run on Jython to ensure this

Genshi
------
Jim Baker and Ariane Paola have played around with Genshi on Jython. Its use of pyexpat is the biggest roadblock. Jython now includes a pyexpat, but it's not fully compatible with CPython's (and doesn't support all the features Genshi uses).

Turbogears 2
------------

Ariane Paola made some progress porting TurboGears 2 components to Jython for Google's Summer of Code. Genshi and SQLAlchemy are the most important pieces that need porting
