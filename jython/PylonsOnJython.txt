Getting Pylons (0.9.6.1) to run on Jython
=========================================

* The ability to install Pylons and all its dependencies:

  * distutils and setuptools (Mostly finished, See `SetuptoolsOnJython`_)

Ensure all dependencies' tests pass:

* nose. Pylons projects require nose, but most packages (including Pylons) use nose as their own test runners.

  requires:

  - the optparse module (added in r4018)

  - compiler modules (compiler requires the parser module which Jython lacks). nose only needs the compiler module to use compiler.consts.CO_GENERATOR; until there's a parser, maybe jython could provide a broken compiler module that doesn't import parser

  - a fix for the cell variable (variables used in closures) bug here: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/667

* Paste, PasteDeploy and PasteScript

* Mako

  - mako uses the compiler module to parse Python code into AST. The compiler module is mostly pure Python code, but its guts are really the native parser module (which Jython lacks)

* Beaker

* Routes

  - I got all of routes' tests to pass on Jython well over a year ago so I don't expect too much trouble here -pjenvey

* WebHelpers

* FormEncode

* simplejson

  * `SetuptoolsOnJython`_ currently has trouble installing simplejson, because it attempts to compile its optional C extensions (that help performance). It expects to catch a distutils.errors.CCompilerError if the compilation fails, but Jython dies much earlier:

  File "/Users/pjenvey/src/java/jython-trunk/dist/Lib/distutils/command/build_ext.py", line 598, in get_ext_filename

  TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects

* decorator

  - Note: decorators aren't currently supported in Jython, however the decorator module doesn't actually use decorators (works on CPython 2.3)

Later down the road:

* SQLAlchemy

  - The [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/672 Dialect Refactor II] ticket will need to be implemented to properly support using SQLAlchemy via Jython's DBAPI jdbc driver, [http://jython.org/Project/userguide.html#database-connectivity-in-jython zxJDBC]. 
  - Frank Wierzbicki has done some preliminary work on using SQLAlchemy with Jython, info [http://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy/browse_frm/thread/d60db24fe1683a41/09320033f406d78b?hl=en&lnk=gst here], and is scheduled to give a talk at PyCon 2008: "Database development with Jython, SQLAlchemy, and Hibernate"
