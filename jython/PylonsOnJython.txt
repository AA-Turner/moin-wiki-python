The things/steps needed to get Pylons running on Jython:

* The ability to install Pylons and all its dependencies:

  - distutils and setuptools (See SetuptoolsOnJython)

Ensure all dependencies' tests pass:

* Paste, PasteDeploy and PasteScript

* Mako

* Beaker

* nose
  - nose requires the optparse (easy) and compiler modules (sort of easy -- compiler requires the parser module, which won't be easy to get on Jython). nose only needs the compiler module to use compiler.consts.CO_GENERATOR; maybe jython could provide a broken compiler module that doesn't import parser.

* Routes

  - (I actually got all of routes' tests to pass on Jython well over a year ago -pjenvey)

* WebHelpers

* FormEncode

* simplejson

* decorator

  - Note: decorators aren't currently supported in Jython, however the decorator module doesn't actually use decorators (works on CPython 2.3)

Later down the road:

* SQLAlchemy. The [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/672 Dialect Refactor II] ticket will need to be implemented to properly support using SQLAlchemy via Jython's DBAPI jdbc driver, [http://jython.org/Project/userguide.html#database-connectivity-in-jython zxJDBC]. Frank Wierzbicki has done some preliminary work on using SQLAlchemy with Jython, info [http://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy/browse_frm/thread/d60db24fe1683a41/09320033f406d78b?hl=en&lnk=gst here]
