I'm Alex, I am a middle-aged Italian pathologist, but it isn't my work that pulled me here; it has been my layman work into Wikipedia, mainly into [[http://it.wikisource.org|it.wikisource]], where I drive a Python bot. I saw a couple of times the word "Jython" but I never drag the issue before. I use Python (far from skilly...) and I'm just approaching Java, and at a first glance I suppose that Jython is great to learn it!
