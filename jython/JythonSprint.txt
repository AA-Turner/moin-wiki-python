Here's what we are working on Dallas:

 * JimBaker - 2.5 Language support in the parser, possibly multiple parser backends
 * CharlieGroves - lining Jython type hierarchy up with CPython, adding rich comparisons to builtin types, other 2.2beta2 bugs

[http://wiki.python.org/moin/JythonSprint Previous Jython sprints] generated some useful content, some of which we will migrate here and elsewhere in the Jython wiki.
