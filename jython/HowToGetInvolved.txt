= How do I get involved in the Jython community? =

Anyone interested in helping to move the effort to develop and promote Jython is welcome to get involved in the community. This page will help you get acquainted with how the community works.

=== Meritocracy ===

To paraphrase GuidoVanRossum, Jython is a language, but it's also a community. We're well aware that Jython progress has been static over the last few years - we want to fix that and we will need help from others to do so. An immediate community goal is to be able to remove that last sentence from this page.

The first step is to read BrianZimmer's MovingJythonForward, which has put some much needed impetus into Jython.


''You're back? Excellent.''

A number of few people like JimHugunin, FinnBock, BarryWarsaw and SamuelePedroni have committed significantly to the Jython and even though things have been static, Jython is regarded as a stable langauge fit for production use. Over time people have been attracted to help out on Jython. Often this happens first by sending little patches, or suggestions, or helping users on the lists, later by lager code and documentation and advocacy contributions. 

Here's where we're at. Currently Jython is managed by the committers to the sourceforge project. Now itâ€™s clear more people want to work on Jython. The intention is that when the committers and the community feels that the person had earned it, he or she will be granted commit access to the repository. The intention is to bootstrap the ''meritocracy'' approach, common in OSS development. Ultimately Jython will be driven by the people who volunteer for the job. The responsibility will lie with those who turn up and contribute. 

=== Discussion ===

Discussion mainly happens happens on the the following fora, currently hosted at sourceforge:

 * jython-users: Discussion of and questions about using Jython; most folks will want this one [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=5586 archive] [http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jython-users join]

 * jython-dev: Discussion of developing and enhancing Jython itself(!) (not how to use Jython) [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=5587 archive] [http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jython-dev join]

Please join the mailing lists to get involved in the discussion.

We would like to get as much value out of the mailing lists as possible. If you have something worth saying, don't be afraid to say it. But please try to write clearly and concisely. 


=== Bugs, Bugs, Bugs ===

We have bugs - if you can help out, that's fantastic. You can the list of open items on the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12867 issue tracker]. Currently we're going through the list to prioritize them - and once NewStyleClasses are introduced you can expect this list to change. But if you see something you want to fix, take a leap - join the jython-dev list and tell the community what you're going to do. Patches are welcomed and should be sent to jython-dev.


=== Features and JEPs ===

Jython is incomplete, esepcially when compared to recent version of Python. BrianZimmer has outlined a roadmap in MovingPythonForward and there is a list of AbsentModules. If you see some aspect of Jython you want to work, the best thing to do is float the idea on jython-dev, if only to see if anyone else is working on or wants to work that area. Don't be too put off if the discussion doesn't go the way you want or expect; the next step is always to write up a concrete proposal for a JythonExtensionProposal (JEP) here on the wiki (see HowToWriteJeps). Having something concrete to discuss helps everyone.
