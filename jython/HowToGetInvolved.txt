= How do I get involved in the Jython community? =

Anyone interested in helping to develop and promote Jython is welcome to get involved. This page will help you get acquainted with how things work.

=== Discussion ===

Discussion mainly happens happens on the the following fora, currently hosted at sourceforge:

 * jython-users: Discussion of and questions about using Jython; most folks will want this one [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jython-users archive] [http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jython-users join]

 * jython-dev: Discussion of developing and enhancing Jython itself(!) (not how to use Jython) [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jython-dev archive] [http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jython-dev join]

Please join the mailing lists to get involved. Communication on the mailing lists is important, so if you have something to say, say it, but please try to say it clearly and concisely, and follow netiquette.

=== Bugs, Bugs, Bugs ===

We have bugs - if you can help out, that's fantastic. You can see the list of open items on the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12867 issue tracker]. 

To get started with the code, see the JythonDeveloperGuide.

=== Features  ===

Jython is incomplete, esepcially when compared to recent version of Python.  There is a RoadMap and a list of AbsentModules . If there is some aspect of Jython you want to work on, the best thing to do is float the idea on jython-dev, if only to see if anyone else is working on or wants to work that area.
