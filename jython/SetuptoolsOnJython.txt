Setuptools requirements:

 * PEP 302: added in Jython 2.2

We don't have:

 * PEP 273 (the zipimport module)
  - Jython's ZipFileImporter is somewhat different that the CPython zipimport module -- it's not a module, and it does not maintain its own _zip_importer_cache (which setuptools utilizes) apart from sys.path_importer_cache
  
  - The Jython zipimport machinery is different: ZipFileImporter only imports zips if they're SyspathArchives: currently .zips and .jars. How does CPython zipimport identify .eggs in sys.path as .zips? (needed for the ez_setup bootstrap process)
 * distutils
  - requires this small patch: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/390 (jython's sys.executable is None)
 * tempfile.mkstemp
 * os.open is used for a small hack having to do with usage of tempfile.mkstemp
 * imp.acquire/release_lock
