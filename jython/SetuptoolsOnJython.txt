Setuptools requirements:

 * PEP 302 style zipimport module '''''Added in r3463'''''
 
 * number of misc. Jython bug fixes '''''most already committed'''''

 * file descriptor support for tempfile.mkstemp, os.open and tarfile '''''Added in r3711'''''
  
 * tempfile.mkstemp '''''Added in r3712'''''

 * os.chdir (also needed for distutils) '''''Added in r3844'''''
 
 * tarfile module '''''Added in r3850'''''

 * a valid sys.executable. required by setuptools and distutils for spawning subprocesses. '''''Added in r3867, enabled via -Dpython.executable (see http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.jython.devel/4068 )'''''


We don't have:

 * distutils: requires [http://hg.underboss.org/jython-pjenvey/rev/1026fe32c01c a number of small patches]:
  
  - distutils metadata for the os.name == 'java' (like path names, default bdist type, etc)
    
  - a jython spawn-like function: "error: don't know how to spawn programs on platform 'java'". os.system works as a replacement

  - a valid sys.executable '''''Added in r3867'''''

  - compile .py files to $py.class instead of .pyc

 * working marshal? setuptools uses marshal.load in a couple places, which either needs to be avoided or possibly some work done to Jython's marshal module
    
 * imp.acquire/release_lock
  This is just a simple lock, but probably needs to be used by internal imp operations. I'm not sure
  
 * setuptools runs a test to ensure .pth files work by running "sys.executable -E -c pass". -E is ignore environment on CPython, but is different on Jython (takes an argument):
 
  -E codec : Use a different codec the reading from the console.
   
 * a site-packages dir (jython needs to include it on sys.path by default)

 * os.chmod. This can be implemented with JNA. We can still support setuptools on deployments lacking JNA if we submit a patch back to setuptools to only use chmod if it exists
  
 * os.lstat. setuptools cut and pasted shutil's rmtree from CPython 2.3, which uses lstat to check for directories. We can support an os.stat that fills in st_mode's directory bit, but can we do lstat (we could with JNA)? We may want to submit a patch to setuptools to avoid lstat (it could avoid it if it used os.path.isdir)
