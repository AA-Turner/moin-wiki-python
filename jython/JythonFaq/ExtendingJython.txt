'''How do I create Java classes that emulate Jython Dictionaries and Sequences?'''

In order to emulate Dictionaries and Sequences, first your Java class must "extend" the org.python.core.PyObject class. The following methods can then be defined on your class in order to emulate these basic Jython types:

  {{{#!java
    public PyObject __finditem__(PyObject key);

    public void __setitem__(PyObject key, PyObject value);

    public void __delitem__(PyObject key);
  }}}
Additionally, you might want to throw the org.python.core.Py.KeyError object if you have any exceptions (Note, you need not declare the Java method as throwing anything.)

'''How do I emulate Jython object attribute access with a Java class?'''

You can develop your own Java class that emulates Jython objects by first extending the org.python.core.PyObject class. Then, implement the following methods on your Java class:
  {{{#!java
    public PyObject __findattr__(String name);

    public void __setattr__(String name, PyObject value);

    public void __delattr__(String name);
  }}}
You may also want to raise exceptions using the org.python.core.Py.AttributeError error class. (Note, you do not need to declare that the method throws this class.)

As in CPython, "a = foo.bar" calls the __findattr__ method on foo, "foo.bar = 'baz'" calls the __setattr__ method on foo, and "delattr(foo, 'bar')" calls the __delattr__ method on foo.

If you plan on storing functions as attributes of your Java object (so that you could say "foo.bar('baz', 'fizzle')", be forwarned that Jython *may or may not* call the __findattr__ method to find the function object depending on the number/types of parameters. You should, additionally, implement the following methods:
  {{{#!java
    public PyObject invoke(String name);

    public PyObject invoke(String name, PyObject arg1);

    public PyObject invoke(String name, PyObject arg1, PyObject arg2);

    public PyObject invoke(String name, PyObject[] args);

    public PyObject invoke(String name, PyObject[] args, String[] keywords); 
  }}}

'''How do I support *args and **kw in Java methods?'''

''(thanks to Finn Bock for the information)''

In Jython (note, this does not work in JPython), you can support keyword arguments on Java methods by defining the method like so (the parameters are the important point):
  {{{#!java
    public PyObject foo(PyObject[] args, String[] keywords);
  }}}
The keywords array contains all of the keywords for the keyword-defined arguments. For example, if you called foo with:
  {{{#!python
    foo(1,2,3,four=4,five=5)
  }}}
args would be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and keywords would be: ['four', 'five'] (an array of 2 elements.)

Additionally, you can use the experimental argument parser org.python.core.ArgParser to deal mapping these two arrays. Consult the Javadocs (or source) for further details on org.python.core.ArgParser.
