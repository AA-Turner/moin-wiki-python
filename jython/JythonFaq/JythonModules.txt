== What parts of the Python library are supported? ==

The good news is that Jython now supports almost all of the standard Python library.

If there is some standard Python module that you have a real need for that doesn't work with Jython yet, please file a bug.

== Can I use the python DB API from Jython? ==

Use zxJDBC which gives data database connectivity from Jython using the Python DB API 2.0 interface. For more information about using zxJDBC see:

- http://www.jython.org/docs/zxjdbc.html

Note: the use of zxJDBC is now discouraged in favour of JyJDBC. One reason for that is the lack of testing in zxJDBC, which makes non trivial to change it.

== Can I use the Numeric package from Jython? ==

Take a look at at Tim Hochberg's Java implementation of Numeric, JNumeric.
