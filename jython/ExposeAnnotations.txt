New-style types in Jython 2.2 were created from Java code using a system of templates that inserted code in the types to be exposed to Python and created new *Derived classes that allowed them to be subclasses.  The type exposing templates have been replaced with Java annotations and bytecode generation as explained in PythonTypesInJava, but the *Derived items are still generated from templates.  They need to be hooked into the bytecode generation system as well.
