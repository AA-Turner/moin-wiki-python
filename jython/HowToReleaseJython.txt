## page was renamed from JythonDeveloperGuide/HowToReleaseJython
These are just some rough notes on the steps needed to make a full release of Jython.  I generally run ant full-build as a test beforehand, as well as testing many of these steps throughout, but since that isn't strictly necessary I'm not including it here.  full-build requires all of the optional jars for the build be available and named in ant.properties.  See build.xml for more information.

 1. Update files in trunk that have information on the current version
  1. build.xml - <property name="jython.version">.  Also version.noplus, jython.major_version, jython.minor_version, jython.micro_version, and jython.release_serial.
  1. imp.java - If there has been any compiler change, increment magic number APIVersion.
  1. NEWS
  1. README
 1. Run regrtest and the bugtests
 1. Copy maint to a tag
  1. svn cp https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/branches/Release_2_2maint https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/tags/Release_2_2_1
 1. build from tag

  1. associate the uploaded file with the new release
  1. also update the Source``Forge News page (announcement can be added in Admin/News/Submit)
