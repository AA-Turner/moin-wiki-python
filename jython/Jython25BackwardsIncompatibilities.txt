You can no longer do PyFile(inputStream) directly from Jython code.  This is because a PyFile that gets an inputStream needs to know the encoding of the stream in order to work, so that the recommended approach is to replace code like:
{{{
from java.io import FileInputStream
from org.python.core import PyFile

fis = FileInputStream("error.txt")
pyf = FileUtil.wrap(fis)
}}}
with code like:
{{{
from java.io import FileInputStream
from org.python.core.util import FileUtil

fis = FileInputStream("error.txt")
pyf = FileUtil.wrap(fis)
}}}
