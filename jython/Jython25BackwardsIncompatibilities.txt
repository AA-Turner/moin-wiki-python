* You can no longer do `PyFile`(inputStream) directly from Jython code.  This is because a `PyFile` that gets an `InputStream` [INSERT REAL REASON], so that the recommended approach is to replace code like:

{{{
from java.io import FileInputStream
from org.python.core import PyFile
fis = FileInputStream("error.txt")
pyf = PyFile(fis)
}}}
with code like:

{{{
from java.io import FileInputStream
from org.python.core.util import FileUtil
fis = FileInputStream("error.txt")
pyf = FileUtil.wrap(fis)
}}}

* types.ArrayType has been removed as CPython never had it. Use array.ArrayTypes instead (which is available in both 2.2 and 2.5)

* The pre and xreadlines modules have been removed
