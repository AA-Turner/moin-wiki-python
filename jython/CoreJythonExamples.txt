Examples related to core Jython / Python will be here. Intended for those new to Python / Jython

=== Print ===
Print Hello world
{{{ print 'Hello World' 
print "Hello World"
}}}

=== JArray ===

I was curious on how to work with jarray and move the arrays between classes after being filled with values and operated. I think this example explains some of the basics. Of course, there are more pythonic ways to do this. Cheers! Alfonso Reyes 

{{{#!python
from java.lang import Math
from jarray import array, zeros
import java.util.Random;

class ArrayClass:
    """    This class will fill an array with random numbers
    and then return the array for further operations
    """
    def __init__(self, elems):
        self.N = elems
        systemEnergy = 0.0025
        self.v = zeros(self.N, "d")     # array of zeros, double type
        v0 = Math.sqrt(2.0 * systemEnergy / self.N)
        for i in range(0, self.N, 1):
            r = java.util.Random()
            self.v[i] = v0 * r.nextInt(self.N)  # same velocity for all particles

    def out(self):
        for i in range(0, self.N, 1):
            print i, self.v[i]

    def get(self):
        return self.v

n = 100
uarr = zeros(n, "d")    # array of double to store some operations
ac = ArrayClass(n)      
ac.out()                # print the array
arr = ac.get()          # get the array to start doing some work on it

# get a first third of the array members and times 10
print "Get a first third of the array members"
for i in range(0, n/3, 1):
    uarr[i] = arr[i] * 10
    print i, arr[i], uarr[i]
