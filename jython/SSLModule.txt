<<TableOfContents(3)>>

== Overview ==

The SSL module was introduced into cpython in version 2.6. It provides extensive support for client and server side SSL.

Jython went straight to version 2.7: there was no jython 2.6.

== Server-side ==

Jython 2.7 currently does not provide server-side SSL support.

== Client-side ==

Jython 2.7 has SSL client-side support, implementing only the '''wrap_socket''' function.

Notes.

 * Java manages certificates completely differently to cpython: see [[NewSocketModule#SSL_Support|socket module documentation on SSL]] for more information.
 * For this reason, all parameters other than the first '''sock''' parameter '''are ignored'''.
