=====Note to admin(s)=====
Trust is a generous thing to hand out freely on the internet.  Obviously being involved
in this project, you aren't new to such things, so surely there must be a reason for having
this completely open to modification.  I'm just curious what that reason is.  I plan on
setting up a wiki on my own site (thebeerlair.com), but I've only just gotten it online, and
have much to do before that I feel needs doing first.  Anyway, if there is some perk of doing
things this way, please let me in on the secret - alkoweb (at) gmail (period) com - please.
Or is my edited version merely being saved locally until it is 'approved', as is how I intend
to set mine up.

PS. Sorry about the upload, was merely curious and didn't think it would go through.
