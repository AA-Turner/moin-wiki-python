Svn to Hg Migration
===================

Not much here to see yet.

The conversion was basically done via:

fix-svn.sh &
convert-jython.sh

from: http://bitbucket.org/pjenvey/pymigr

These need to be ran with a modified version of hgsubversion, from here (with all three mq patches applied):

http://bitbucket.org/pjenvey/hgsubversion-jython-conv

After the conversion is complete a couple other things are done:

1. Create a jython-svnmap.txt (maps svn revisions/branch names to hg ids) via jython-svnmap.py
2. Create bookmarks for the fullhistory repo with jython-old-branches.txt jython-svnmap.txt and jython-bmarks2hg.py (believe the final output still needs some fixing to create 'hg book' commands)
3. Finally, dummy merge up the stable branches
