'''Profile:'''

Developer Team Manager for a financial software editor.

'''What I do:'''

I use Jython 2.1 mostly to write unit tests (much easier than with java itself).

We use Java and C-Python a lot in our development, on Windows, HP-UX, Tru64, AIX, Solaris, Linux.

'''What I'm interested in:'''

Having Jython up to date with Java (1.4 +), if possible with a 2.3.4+ version of Python.

'''Where I think I can help:'''

Regression testing : we have an experience in unit-testing, integration testing, etc... on different platforms.
 * We could help testing Jython on all our OSes, with different versions of Java.
 * We could help setting up the tests, plug our testing systems on your svn, automate the emails, ...

'''Why I like Jython:'''

 * Java is a langage I must use 
  * Tt has some very powerful frameworks
  * It has an history
 * Python is a langage that is so easy to use... and so powerful.
