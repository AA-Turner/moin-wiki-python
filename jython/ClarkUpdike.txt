== Deleting wiki pages ==

These are the directions I use for deleting pages on an intranet moinmoin wiki I administer.  These directions assume you have a login on the host machine, allowing you to temporarily turn on a flag in a config file that let's you delete a page and then turn it off (making it safe since it's only temporarily enabled).

First of all, if you aren't in the MoinPagesEditorGroup, you'll need to contact an admin, and remind them to follow the directions on this page.

To delete a wiki page: 
 * make sure that Moin``Moin acl is activated in moin_config.py (it should be left on)
 * turn on the Delete``Page action in moin_config.py (look for the 'security critical actions' section towards the bottom of the file and set the "if 0:" to  "if 1:" )
 * put an acl entry on the page:
{{{
#acl AdminGroup:read,delete
}}}
 * edit the page and look for the Delet``Page action at the very bottom
 * follow the steps to delete the page
 * turn off the Delete``Page action in moin_config.py

Note: moin_config.py is probably here, /web/local/share/moin/rmiswiki

== Misc ==
 *Create an anchor.
{{{
[[Anchor(myAnchorLabel)]]
}}}

 *Linking to anchors on another page:: you must use an "interwiki" style link.
{{{
[wiki:Self:SomePage/SomeSubPage#someBookmark bookmarkDisplayText]
}}}

 *Footnotes macro[[FootNote(This is a sample footnote [look for it at the bottom of the page].)]]
{{{
[[FootNote(This is a sample footnote [look for it at the bottom of the page].)]]
Must be separated from the prior word by a space.
}}}

 *Force a new page (aka arbitrary page name).[[BR]]
{{{
["/mynewpage"]
}}}

 *Link to a subpage (there several ways to do [wiki:Self:HelpOnEditing/SubPages this])[[BR]]
[wiki:Self:JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes Eclipse notes] [[BR]]
JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes
{{{
[wiki:Self:JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes Eclipse notes] <- link on arbitrary text
JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes                           <- wiki style link
}}}


 *Prevent a New``Page.[[BR]]
{{{
Py``System``State
}}}

 *Embedding python (one way--there's [wiki:Self/HelpOnFormatting#codeDisplay others]).[[BR]]
{{{
{{{
#!python
print "jython rocks!"                
} } } <-- don't include these spaces (it's just to escape them)
}}}

 *Or ticks for `print "jython rocks!"`.[[BR]]
{{{
`print "jython rocks!"`
}}}

 *Inserting "new lines" into a paragraph.[[BR]]
{{{
