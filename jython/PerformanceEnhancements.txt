Ideas
=====

GC Expense
----------
Our algorithms are not always the problem, sometimes it's memory {de}allocations that slow you down

Frame creation
--------------
Frames are allocated for every Python method call, which is a GC expense. CPython (and JRuby?) recycle frame objects. Reducing the number of fields on the frame can also help (but this likely isn't possible)
