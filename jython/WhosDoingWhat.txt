 * datetime -- all python version from CPython sandbox should work pending completion of new-style class conversions.
 * sets -- all python version from CPython 2.3 looks very good -- 5 failing tests: 4 having to do with pickling and 1 that needs a closer look.  Overall it looks like sets.py should work pretty much unchanged.
 * Working on 2.3 test cases for PyLong and PyInteger (Actually done, just needs some prep for check-in).
 * done with: new-style <type 'tuple'> <type 'float'> <type 'file'> <type 'str'>
