 * datetime and sets (testing the python modules)
    * datetime -- all python version from CPython sandbox is pending small problems with new-style classes.
    * sets -- all python version from CPython 2.3 looks very good (once I stopped making silly mistakes while testing) 5 failing tests: 4 having to do with pickling and 1 that needs a closer look.  Overall it looks like sets.py should work pretty much unchanged.
