Initially, I am just going to dump stuff out so that I don't forget it. Later on, I hope to savagely re-edit it into a more coherent structure.

== Overview ==
unicodedata is essentially a lookup table of the [http://www.unicode.org/ucd/ Unicode Character Database] that is published as part of the Unicode specification.

 * [http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/uamb.pdf Unicode Ate My Brain] Nice discussion about the different table lookups, for people like myself without a classical CS background or strong knowledge about data structures and algorithms.
