In Jython 2.2, the PSF license is used as the main license.  
Charles Groves would like to be able to remove the Jython 2.0/2.1 license from the LICENSE.txt file in Jython.

To make this legally possible, we need to get signed contributor agreements from everyone who contributed to
the 2.0 and 2.1 releases.

If you participated in 2.0 and 2.1, you should
print out the Contribution Agreement for Jython, sign it, and mail/fax the signed
form to the PSF:

 * http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form-jython/

If you're a new contributor whose first work is for Jython 2.2 or later,
you should sign the standard PSF contribution form:

 * http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/

== 2.0/2.1 Contributors ==

The notation '(covered)' next to a name means that the PSF has a contributor agreement on file for the person.  '(emailed)' means a request has been emailed to them to send in an agreement.

Committer list from the CVS logs; I haven't checked whether the PSF has contributor agreements from
these people.
