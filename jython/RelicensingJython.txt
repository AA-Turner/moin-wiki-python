From 2.2 forward, Jython is using the PSF license.  To use it, all new contributors need to send in the [http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/ PSF contribution form].  The form allows the PSF to relicense the code the contributor has written under its own license, and if the need arises, to change the license in the future; the contributor still retains the copyright for the work.  See the [http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/ contribution agreement] page for more detail.
