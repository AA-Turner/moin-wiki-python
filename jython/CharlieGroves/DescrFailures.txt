= To File =
 * methods - binding instance method to class calls class instead of instance
 * supers - subclassing super causes binding to break
 * mutable_names - setting __name__ on a class does nothing
 * slotspecials - slots need __weakref__
 * metaclass - new on metaclass not called

= Don't Understand Failure =
 * overloading - a[0:10] = "foo" doesn't call __setslice__ on a
 * inherits - __eq__ on inherited classes is not called.  superclass is used instead
 * binopoverride - see inherits
 * str_subclass_as_dict_key - see inherits
 * rich_comparisons - see inherits

= Cpython Specific Tests =
 * checks that things aren't allowed to inherit CFunction.  I doubt we care.
  * errors
 * expects immediate gc
  * slots
  * subtype_resurrection
  * weakref
 * expects attributes to be descriptors
