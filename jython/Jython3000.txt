Ideas for backwards incompatible changes in 3.x
===============================================
It would be good if most of these can have warnings in 2.6

Java
----

* Methods that do not take a ThreadState when there is a method that does (mainly in PyObject)
* All of Py.java (It's a giant global that we should be able to split up -- maybe it will just become tiny)

Registry
--------

* respectJavaAccessibility

Package Cache
-------------

* Disable by default, add an easy flag to enable.
