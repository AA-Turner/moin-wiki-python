Basic Install
=============

Jython 2.2.1 is distributed as an executable jar file installer.  After
`downloading <download.html>`__ it, either double click the
|stable.installer.jar| or run java with the -jar option

.. parsed-literal::

    java -jar |stable.installer.jar|

This will start the regular GUI installer on most systems, or a
consoler installer on headless systems.  To force the installer to
work in headless mode invoke the installer with a console switch

.. parsed-literal::

  java -jar |stable.installer.jar| --console

The installer will then walk through a similar set of steps in
graphical or console mode: showing the license, selecting an install
directory and JVM and actually copying Jython to the filesystem.
After this completes, Jython is installed in the directory you
selected.  There's a script in the install directory, jython on Unix
like systems or jython.bat on Windows, that will start up the Jython
console which can be used to dynamically explore Jython and the Java
runtime.

Standalone mode
===============

The standalone option does no caching and so avoids the startup overhead (most likely at the cost of some speed in calling Java classes, but I have not profiled it)

You can try it out by downloading the installer from here_

.. _here: stable.download_

running it like so:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ java -jar |stable.installer.jar|

And when you come to the "Installation type" page, select "Standalone".

When the installation is done, you will have a jython.jar with the /Lib files included that can be run like this: ::

    $ java -jar jython.jar

You will get a jython prompt with no caching.  Of course you can run scripts just by calling them as you might expect: ::

    $ java -jar jython.jar script.py

And you can add this jar to the classpath of your app, which will allow standard imports.

Installation options
====================

You can get a list of the installer options by running:

.. parsed-literal::

	$ java -jar |stable.installer.jar| --help
