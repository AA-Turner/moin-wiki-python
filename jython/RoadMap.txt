'''Note:''' This page is fairly out of date, as the jython community was slumbering for a time.  Recently activity has picked back up, and jython 2.2 beta 1 was released on February 8, 2007.
 
= Where Is Jython Going? =

First of all, Jython recently received one of three PSF grants for so development and community building will continue. The Big Picture as of the start of 2005 can be found in MovingJythonForward.

----

== February 2005 ==

Jython.org update and addition of a wiki. ''If you're reading this, we're getting somewhere ;)''

Assign bugs. The buglist needs to be prioritized and non-bugs need to be removed. In part this has to happen with NewStyleClasses. as bugs will be best evaluated in light of that shipment. The patch list will also need to be cleaned up and reviewed.

'''Milestone:''' Implementation of NewStyleClasses. One of the primary missing features in Jython is the implementation of new style classes which SamuelePedroni has been working on. 

'''Milestone:''' Design for the implementation of PEP302 and initial development.  This effort will be led by BrianZimmer.  If you're interested in assisting let him know.


== March 2005 ==

Start fixing bugs. High priority bugs will need to be dealt with, and the community will need to be made aware of critical open bugs!

Removal of makefiles, update the ant build. It's likely this could involve a reorganisation of the repository. '''Any repository reorg is dependent on NewStyleClasses having shipped'''. Some people have indicated a preference for Subversion going forward - the community should allow that merely discussing a change of VCS is going to take a good amount of time.

'''Milestone:''' A transparent community process for incorporating patches and contributions.


== April 2005 ==

Final decision on choice of VCS and repository layout.

Creation of repeatable build, deployment and installation scripts to facilitate future releases. The current installer is known not to work.

'''Milestone:''' Jython 2.4 alpha. The completion of the new-style class integration, the fixing of critical bugs will culminate in the release of an initial alpha. 


== May 2005 ==

A good amount of time in May can be expected to deal with feedback from the alpha release.

Simplifying import (removing PackageManager).  Simplifying the importing of Java classes would ease a lot frustration and make things more consistent.

'''Milestone:''' CollectionsIntegration, removing 1.1 support.

Consider the current situation:

    {{{
    >>> from java.util import ArrayList
    >>> a = ArrayList([1,2,3])
    Traceback (innermost last):
      File "<console>", line 1, in ?
    TypeError: java.util.ArrayList(): 1st arg can't be coerced to java.util.Collection or int
    }}}

and as a result, slate the following for implementation:

 * Support for boolean type
 * PEP 302 (New Import Hooks)
 * Logging (PEP 282, there exists a patch proposal for integration with Log4J)
 * DataType marshalling from the Jython runtime to Java runtime
 * User-defined types
 * JythonC integration into standard interpreter compiler
 * Changes required for new Java 1.5 updates (enum & assert)

== June 2005 ==

Fix issues found in the alpha and incorporate the tighter Java integration features as they arrive. 

'''Milestone:''': Jython 2.4 beta. The resulting work will be released as a beta candidate.


== July 2005 ==

bugs, bugs, bugs. And who knows what else. Plus this time of year a lot of people are on vacation.


== August 2005 ==


'''Milestone:''': Jython 2.4 final. 


== September 2005 ==

After releasing a final the decisions about source control can be implemented.  It's important to have a firm plan in place by this time and to have delivered a new and stable Jython release prior to any migration.

With the final release, focus is expected to center on AbsentModules. It is proposed that at least following modules be delivered by this time:

    * SetsModule
    * SelectModule
    * DateTimeModule

The community will dictate the remainder of the modules to be delivered.


== October 2005 ==

Missing Built-ins. A number of built-ins are missing as well methods core classes have appeared since 2.1. Some of the missing features have been documented in the whatsnew lists available with each new Python:

    * http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.1/whatsnew/whatsnew22.html
    * http://python.org/2.3/highlights.html
    * http://python.org/2.4/highlights.html


'''Milestone:''': Jython 2.4.1 release candidate.


== November 2005 ==

Fix issues found in the release candidate and incorporate implemented modules as they arrive. 


'''Milestone:''': Jython 2.4.1 final.
