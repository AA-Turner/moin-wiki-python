== Adrien Beau ==

I'm a software engineer working with Java technologies on a daily basis. I've also been dabbling in Python for quite some time. So, it's only natural that I am very interested in Jython.

You can leave me a message on this page, or you can mail me at gmail.com. Don't expect timely replies, even though I will eventually answer.
