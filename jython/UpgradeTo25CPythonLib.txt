To Fix
======

* test_array - needs unicode array support
* test_code - no co_names, not certainly supported by the compiler, perhaps not likely to be (see http://docs.python.org/lib/bytecodes.html)
* test_generators - not rejecting incorrect syntax wrt yield; but others need to be resolved outside of parser (maybe eval order?); fibgen is causing parse issues; tracebacks have extra blank lines apparently
* test_genexps - need to test iterability of an object like int; similar syntax issues as test_generator
* test_inspect - getsource (no surprise with this type of issue)
* test_mailbox - TestMaildir.test_clean fails due to os.utime not setting atime
* test_site - del sys.setdefaultencoding does nothing
* test_struct - needs new 2.5 struct.Struct type and pack_into/unpack_from
* test_threadedtempfile - import lock is probably in the wrong place
* test_unicode - lack of idna encoding (which needs unicodedata)

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_scope - sometimes fails due to GC
* test_tuple - sometimes with OutOfMemoryError during regrtest

Parser
======

* test_compile - over acceptance of incorrect syntax; need to raise problems with unicode being declared to have an encoding!
* test_contextlib - likely parser eval order
* test_decorators - eval order
* test_distuils - SyntaxError when attempting to py_compile to $py.class (probably parser newline problems)
* test_doctest - exec doesn't work
* test_genexp, test_generator - parser probs
* test_java_integration - ReservedNamesTest (in/exec), also there's class
* test_jy_compile - not rejecting syntax, is there an issue with exec code in a_dict?
