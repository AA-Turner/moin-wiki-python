To Fix
======

* test_coercion - __cmp__ doesn't utilize __coerce__?
* test_contextlib - 1 failure, test_contextmanager_trap_yield_after_throw
* test_doctest - unicode problem
* test_generators - tracebacks have extra blank lines apparently; different syntax errors causing doctest to reject; closing issues
* test_genexps - need to test iterability of an object like int; similar syntax issues as test_generator
* test_inspect
* test_multibytecodec
* test_multibytecodec_support
* test_site - del sys.setdefaultencoding does nothing
* test_struct - needs new 2.5 struct.Struct type and pack_into/unpack_from
* test_tempfile - 1 failure, test_usable_template
* test_unicode - lack of idna encoding (which needs unicodedata)
* test_univnewlines - test_doctest failures don't restore sys.stdin -- causes to skip (it normally passes)
* test_with - 1 failure, testNestedSingleStatements (__main__.ExceptionalTestCase), this is likely the same issue as test_contextlib
* test_zipfile - possibly struct issues?

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_scope - sometimes fails due to GC
* test_socket - historically this is the case on SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF
* test_tuple - sometimes OutOfMemoryErrors during regrtest (when creating a set from a large list of small tuples). maybe not the tests fault, but the fact that the regrtest progressively uses more and more memory as it goes: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/917

Parser
======

* test_builtin - compile/exec/eval problems
* test_compile - over acceptance of incorrect syntax; need to raise problems with unicode being declared to have an encoding!
* test_contextlib - likely parser eval order
* test_decorators - eval order
* test_future - bad line numbers
* test_genexp, test_generator - parser probs

Development
===========

* test__rawffi (for ctypes, ported from PyPy)
