#format rst

To Fix
======

* test_code - no co_names, not certainly supported by the compiler, perhaps not likely to be (see http://docs.python.org/lib/bytecodes.html)
* test_datetime - rounding, strptime missing a function (looks like new functionality in 2.5)
* test_distuils - dependence on emitting .pyc, also case of test_home_installation_*
* test_email - codecs.charmap_build, other codec issue
* test_float - __getformat__
* test_functools - partial is not a type (yet)
* test_generator - not rejecting incorrect syntax wrt yield; but others need to be resolved outside of parser (maybe eval order?); fibgen is causing parse issues; tracebacks have extra blank lines apparently
* test_genexps - need to test iterability of an object like int; similar syntax issues as test_generator
* test_gettext - codecs.charmap_build
* test_index - no support for __index__ yet
* test_inspect - getsource (no surprise with this type of issue)
* test_mailbox - TestMaildir.test_clean fails due to os.utime not setting atime

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_scope - sometimes fails due to GC

Parser
======

* test_compile - over acceptance of incorrect syntax; need to raise problems with unicode being declared to have an encoding!
* test_contextlib - likely parser eval order
* test_decorators - eval order
* test_doctest - lineno is incorrect, parser prob
* test_genexp, test_generator - see above
* test_java_integration - ReservedNamesTest (in/exec), also there's class
* test_jy_compile - not rejecting syntax, is there an issue with exec code in a_dict?
* test_univnewlines - SyntaxError (due to newline issues?) and wrong line numbers in test_execfile
