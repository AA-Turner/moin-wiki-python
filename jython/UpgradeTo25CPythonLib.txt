To Fix
======

* test_builtin - may still have parse problems, mostly other issues
* test_doctest - unicode problem
* test_generators - parser probs; ill-behaved generator doesn't finalize upon GC
* test_inspect
* test_list, test_userlist - test_set_subscript
* test_multibytecodec
* test_multibytecodec_support
* test_site - del sys.setdefaultencoding does nothing
* test_struct - needs new 2.5 struct.Struct type and pack_into/unpack_from
* test_unicode - no idna encoding (which needs unicodedata); raises wrong error for decode to int of unicode string
* test_univnewlines - test_doctest failures don't restore sys.stdin -- causes to skip (it normally passes)
* test_with - 1 failure, testNestedSingleStatements (__main__.ExceptionalTestCase), this is a tricky one
* test_zipfile - possibly struct issues?

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_socket - historically this is the case on SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF
* test_tuple - sometimes OutOfMemoryErrors during regrtest (when creating a set from a large list of small tuples). maybe not the tests fault, but the fact that the regrtest progressively uses more and more memory as it goes: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/917

Parser
======

* test_compiler - one line functions are not working compiler.parse (causing AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'suite')
* test_decorators - compile(..., "eval") not working for test_dbcheck

Development
===========

* test__rawffi (for ctypes, ported from PyPy)
