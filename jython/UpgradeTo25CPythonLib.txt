To Fix
======

* test_unicode

  * test_codecs_idna - no idna encoding (which needs unicodedata 3.2.0) http://bugs.jython.org/issue1153
* test_stringprep - http://bugs.jython.org/issue1758320

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_socket - historically this is the case on SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF

Under Development
=================

Or perhaps more accurately, the following *should* be under development.

* _rawffi (for ctypes, ported from PyPy)
* bz2 (Georgy Berdyshev is looking at this. Leo User's bz2 module code is available from here: http://underboss.org/~pjenvey/jython/jythonx-bits.tar.bz2 )
* multibytecodec (implies test_multibytecodec_support)
* unicodedata - need a Java implementation, not our current Jython workaround (too slow to load, on the order of a couple of seconds)
