To Fix
======

* test_coercion - __cmp__ doesn't utilize __coerce__?
* test_generators - not rejecting incorrect syntax wrt yield; but others need to be resolved outside of parser (maybe eval order?); fibgen is causing parse issues; tracebacks have extra blank lines apparently
* test_genexps - need to test iterability of an object like int; similar syntax issues as test_generator
* test_inspect
* test_multibytecodec
* test_multibytecodec_support
* test_os - 1 failure, test_access, looks like a $py.class <=> .pyc mixup
* test_runpy - no PySystemState.startswith; no imp.getmagic
* test_site - del sys.setdefaultencoding does nothing
* test_struct - needs new 2.5 struct.Struct type and pack_into/unpack_from
* test_tempfile - 1 failure, test_usable_template
* test_unicode - lack of idna encoding (which needs unicodedata)
* test_univnewlines - test_doctest failures don't restore sys.stdin -- causes to skip (it normally passes)
* test_with
* test_zipfile - possibly struct issues?

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_scope - sometimes fails due to GC
* test_socket - historically this is the case on SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF
* test_tuple - sometimes with OutOfMemoryError during regrtest

Parser
======

* test_builtin - compile/exec/eval problems
* test_compile - over acceptance of incorrect syntax; need to raise problems with unicode being declared to have an encoding!
* test_contextlib - likely parser eval order
* test_decorators - eval order
* test_doctest - exec doesn't work
* test_future - bad line numbers
* test_genexp, test_generator - parser probs
* test_java_integration - ReservedNamesTest (in/exec), also there's class
* test_jy_compile - not rejecting syntax, is there an issue with exec code in a_dict?

Development
===========

* test__rawffi (for ctypes, ported from PyPy)
* test_csv - http://bugs.jython.org/issue1650802
