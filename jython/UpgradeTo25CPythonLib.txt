To Fix
======

* test_doctest - test_doctest4.txt has issues in String <=> PyString conversion; see email by LeoSoto to jython-dev 
* test_generators

  * parser probs where we don't reject bad syntax
  * ill-behaved generator doesn't finalize upon GC
  * closure setup in visitLambda and visitGeneratorExp does not interact properly with a yield point, resulting in bad bytecode

* test_unicode

  * test_codecs_errors - raises wrong error for decode to int of unicode string
  * test_codecs_idna - no idna encoding (which needs unicodedata)

Parser
======
* test_with - with/as will be new keywords, we need to emit the appropriate warning

Flaky/arch?
===========

* test_cpickle
* test_descr
* test_socket - historically this is the case on SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF
* test_scope
* test_tuple - sometimes OutOfMemoryErrors during regrtest (when creating a set from a large list of small tuples). maybe not the tests fault, but the fact that the regrtest progressively uses more and more memory as it goes: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/917


Under Development
=================

Or perhaps more accurately, the following *should* be under development.

* _rawffi (for ctypes, ported from PyPy)
* bz2
* multibytecodec (implies test_multibytecodec_support)
* unicodedata - need a Java implementation, not our current Jython workaround (too slow to load, on the order of a couple of seconds)
