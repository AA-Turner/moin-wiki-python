'''Gaps between Jython and Django'''

 * Jython does not have {{{__builtins__}}} as a module.  Django adds "_" as a convenience method for calling gettext in {{{django/conf/__init__.py}}}.  Jython should make {{{__builtins__}}} a module.
 * Jython does not have {{{sys.stdout.isatty}}}.  Jython should get added to the exclusions around that call in {{{django/core/management.py}}} (win32 and 'Pocket PC' are already excluded).
