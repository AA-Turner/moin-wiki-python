== Using Django on Jython ==

Finally, Django works on Jython, without any special patching. Right now you have to use the development version of both projects, but as soon as Django and Jython ship a new release, you will be able to use that too.

So, here are the steps to get Django on Jython running.

 1. First, get a fresh version of Jython, and build it:

    {{{
$ svn co https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/branches/asm/  jython-dev
$ cd jython-dev
$ ant
}}}

    This should create a `dist/` directory inside `jython-dev/`. The jython "executable" (a shell script, actually) is under `dist/bin`. You may want to alias the command to avoid typing the whole path each time, with the command: 

    {{{
$ alias jython25=/path/to/jython-dev/dist/bin/jython
}}}

    (or perhaps you prefer to add the directory to your `PATH`. Anyway, whatever works for you is OK)

 2. Check out and install Django:

    {{{
$ svn co http://code.djandgoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django-dev
$ cd django-dev
$ jython25 setup.py install # Assuming you choose to use the "alias" trick explained on the previous point
}}}

    You may also like to make an alias for "django-admin.py". Very useful if you also use Django with CPython: 

    {{{
$ alias django-admin-jy="jython25  /path/to/jython-dev/dist/bin/django-admin.py"
}}}

 3. Check out and install django-jython:

    {{{
$ svn co http://django-jython.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-jython
$ cd django-jython
$ jython25 setup.py install
}}}

 4. Start a project. 
    {{{
$ django-admin-jy startproject myproject
}}}

 5. Edit `myproject/settings.py` and change the `DATABASE_ENGINE` to `doj.backends.zxjdbc.postgresql`.

At this point, you can follow the great [http://djangoproject.com/documentation/ Django documentation], remembering to use the `jython25` command instead of `python`, and the `JYTHONPATH` variable instead of `PYTHONPATH`. Have fun!
