== Using Django on Jython ==

Finally, Django works on Jython, without any special patching. Here are the steps to get Django on Jython running:

 1. First, get a fresh version of Jython. Any release after 2.5b2 should work fine.

 2. Check out and install Django 1.0.X (The 1.0.2 release mostly work, but you will have to manually apply this patch: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9789 .

    {{{
$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/ django-1.0.X
$ cd django-1.0.X
$ jython setup.py install
}}}
    
    You may also like to make an alias for "django-admin.py". Very useful if you also use Django with CPython: 

    {{{
$ alias django-admin-jy="jython /path/to/jython-dev/dist/bin/django-admin.py"
}}}

 3. Download and install the latest release of django-jython:

    {{{
$ wget http://django-jython.googlecode.com/files/django-jython-1.0b1.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz django-jython-1.0b1.tar.gz
$ cd django-jython-1.0b1
$ jython setup.py install
}}}

 4. Start a project. 
    {{{
$ django-admin-jy startproject myproject
}}}

 5. Edit `myproject/settings.py` and change the `DATABASE_ENGINE` to `doj.backends.zxjdbc.postgresql`.

At this point, you can follow the great [[http://djangoproject.com/documentation/|Django documentation]], remembering to use the `jython25` command instead of `python`, and the `JYTHONPATH` variable instead of `PYTHONPATH`. Have fun!

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Running the test suite on Windows ===

Seems like there is an issue with popen() on windows, which blocks the Django test suite. You can try skipping the offending test using these two patches (against Django 1.0.2), written by Victor Ng:
