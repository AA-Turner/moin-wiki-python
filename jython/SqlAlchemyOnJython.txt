SQLAlchemy on Jython
====================

SQLAlchemy is not formally supported on Jython yet, but the 0.6 release plans to support a wider array of DBAPI implementations, including Jython's JDBC/DBAPI driver: `zxJDBC`_.

The basis for this support is the `Dialect Refactor II <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/672>`_ ticket.

* Frank Wierzbicki, Ariane Paoao and others have made some progress making SQLAlchemy 0.4/0.5 work with MySQL via zxJDBC by patching SQLAlchemy

* Jonathan Ellis made an Oracle backend for SQLAlchemy via zxJDBC: http://pylonshq.com/pasties/77c3184b14d6936d86d13e4e65df92d2 Some other zxJDBC dialects would likely follow this example. Reports are it works under 0.5 but not 0.5.2: http://pieceofpy.com/index.php/2009/03/13/jython-25-and-snakefight-for-deploying-pylons-w-sqlalchemy-oracle/
