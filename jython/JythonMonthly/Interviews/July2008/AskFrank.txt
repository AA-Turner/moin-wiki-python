= Ask Frank! =

Welcome to the Ask Frank question form for July 2008!

I've been in touch with [http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/ Frank Wierzbicki] of Sun Microsystems.  In case you aren't aware, Frank is one of the top Jython developers, and [http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/2008/02/jythons-future-looking-sunny.html earlier this year] Sun Microsystems hired him to work on Jython full time!  

He has agreed to answer questions from the community for our July 2008 newsletter.  Gather your best questions and post them here for Frank.  If you have issues posting the questions to this wiki page, then please send them to me at [mailto:juneau001@gmail.com juneau001@gmail.com] so that they can be included.  The deadline for posting questions is July 11th.  After that time, Frank Wierzbicki will choose which ones he wishes to answer and we will include them in the next distribution.

Please post your questions to '''Ask Frank''' below or email them to me at [mailto:juneau001@gmail.com juneau001@gmail.com].  Please include your name and  email address if you wish.

Thanks in advance for your participation...this is a great opportunity for the Jython community.  Special thanks to Frank Wierzbicki for his time!

== Questions for Frank ==

I'll start it off with the question we all want to ask:

1)  You've been with Sun for just over three months now, how is Jython development at Sun been going so far?  

2)  To me it seems from the Python side, Jython is considered irrelevant.  Is there any effort to get Jython more into a cooperative effort with Python development?  (marvin greenberg,  public dot marvin on gmail dot com)
