== Conclusion ==

Decorators are bound to become a major benefit to Jython applications.  By reviewing the brief examples which I have posted above, one can see how useful the decorator concept may be.  Certainly this type of addition to the language is not something that will be used in every piece of Jython code, but it can be enormously beneficial in the places where it is used properly.  One can only imagine the possibilities of including decorators with the many Java APIs which are available to the Jython community.
