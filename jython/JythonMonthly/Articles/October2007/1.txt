RSS and Jython Using Project ROME

RSS is an old technology now...it has been around for years.  However, it is a technology which remains
very useful for disseminating news and other information.  The ROME project on java.net is helping
to make parsing, generating, and publishing RSS and Atom feeds a breeze for any Java developer.  

Since I am particularly fond of translating Java to Jython code, I've taken a simple example from the 
Project ROME wiki and translated a Java RSS reader into Jython.  It is quite easy to do, and it only
takes a few lines of code.

Keep in mind that you would still need to build a front-end viewer for such an RSS reader, but
I think you will get the idea of how easy it can be just to parse a feed with Project ROME and Jython.

== Setting Up The CLASSPATH ==

In order to use this example, you must obtain the ROME and JDOM jar files and place them into your CLASSPATH.

Windows:
{{{
set CLASSPATH=C:\Jython\Jython2.2\rome-0.9.jar;%CLASSPATH%
set CLASSPATH=C:\Jython\Jython2.2\jdom.jar;%CLASSPATH%
}}}
