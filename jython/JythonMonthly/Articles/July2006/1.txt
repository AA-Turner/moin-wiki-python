'''Accessing your Jython code from Java'''

''Submitted by: Josh Juneau''

One of the most powerful features of Jython is that it is possible to access Jython code directly within a Java application.  Many times performing simple tasks within Java can produce bloated code which is difficult to maintain.  Jython gives you the ability to take that same code and reduce the complexity, producing easier to read and highly maintainable code.

The key behind accessing jython code from within a java appliation is the "jythonc" utility.  This utility has the ability to compile jython code into a compatible java source.  ''jythonc'' can also create jar files, freeze associated code modules, enable dependency tracking, and much more.
