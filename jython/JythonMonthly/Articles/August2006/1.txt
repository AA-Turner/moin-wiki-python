Are you still using the Jython ''print'' command to show your errors?  How about in a production environment, are you using any formal logging?  If not, you should be doing so...and the Apache log4j API makes it easy to do so.  Many Java developers have grown to love the log4j API and it is utilized throughout much of the community.  That is great news for Jython developers since we've got direct access to Java libraries!

==Setting Up Your Environment==


==Using log4j in a Jython Application==

==Using log4j in Jython Scripts==

Many may ask, why in the world would you be interested in logging information about your scripts?  Most of the time a script is executed interactively via the command line.  However, there are plenty of instances where it makes sense to have the system invoke a script for you.  As you probably know, this technique is used quite often within an environment to run nightly tasks, or even daily tasks which are automatically invoked on a scheduled basis.  For these cases, it can be extremely useful to log errors or information using log4j.  Some may even wish to create a separate automated task to email these log files after the tasks complete.
