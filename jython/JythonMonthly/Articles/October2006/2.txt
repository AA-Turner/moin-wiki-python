= Web Application Development with Jython, Struts and Hibernate =

'''''Submitted By: Berlin Brown'''''

In Progress.

With all the discussion centered around the java web-application frameworks including Struts, SpringMVC and WebWork, how does one interface these with Jython and why would you want to do so.  Normally, you will do this the same way that you would in a typical standalone console application.  You must find a way to invoke the Jython interpreter and then execute your Jython code.
The same is done in a Servlet environment.  This example demostrates how to put together a web-application that uses the Struts MVC (model, view, controller) framework and also uses Hibernate for persisting our objects to the database.  Jython is used for all the backend work.
