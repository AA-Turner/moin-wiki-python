If you are interested in posting an article, please create a new wiki page and name it 
http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY/n where "Month" is the newsletter month, "YYYY" is the newsletter year, and "n" 
is the next article in the sequence.  


You can then add that link onto the main MonthYYYY article page: 
(http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/MonthYYYY) .
