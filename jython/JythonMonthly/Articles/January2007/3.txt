'''Introduction'''
 During Oct-Nov 2006 there was a thread in the jython-users group titled "adding Jars to sys.path". More accurately the objective there was to add Jars to the sys.path at runtime. Several people asked the question, "Why would you want to do that?" Well there are at least 2 good reasons. First, if you want to distribute a jython or Java package that includes non-standard Jars in it, perhaps you want to make life easier for the target user and deamnd that they know how to set environment variables. A second even more compelling reason is when there ''is no normal user account to provide environment variables'''. What?
