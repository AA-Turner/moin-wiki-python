This month's newsletter is what I'd like to call a "cram" issue.  Since there were no articles or tutorials to add this month, I've decided to cram all of the Jython-related material on the web into one section.  The links below lead to blogs, news, videos, or other material which is new to the web within the past few weeks.  There is definitely a lot of buzz about Jython lately...and that is great news!

== New Jython Book ==

Take a look at the new Jython book by author Nishio Hirokazu.  This book is written in Japanese, and it aims to introduce Jython to Java programmers.  It focuses on Python grammer and the differences between Java and Python.  Examples in this book include tests using JyConsole, Doctest, and interactive MIDI controlling.

Take a look at the book site:
