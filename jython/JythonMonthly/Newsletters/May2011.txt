'''In Progress...stay tuned'''

This is the Jython Monthly newsletter for the months of April and May of 2011.  This newsletter will now be distributed every other month.  Therefore, there will be six issues per year.  I want to generate the best content to make it worthwhile for you to read.  That being said, content has become more limited on a monthly basis, and it just makes sense to combine a couple of months worth of information into one newsletter now.  Also, the Jython Podcast will not be distributed with every release of the Jython Monthly newsletter any longer.  This is mostly due to time constraints on my part, but I do plan to continue distributing podcasts when there are milestones made with Jython or if there are interviews.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this month's newsletter.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the newsletter, please feel free to send them to jythonpodcast@gmail.com.  I appreciate the feedback!

Thanks

[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/jythondocs/|Jython Documentation Set]]

The Jython documentation set has been made available to the public via Sourceforge.net.  If you would like to pull down the latest set of documentation for using Jython, go to the project and check it out.  You can build the sources using Sphinx, and the sources are available via Mercurial.  We are always looking for contributors, so if anyone is interested in helping keep the docs up to date, please grab a copy of them and send mail to the Jython-dev list for commit privileges.
