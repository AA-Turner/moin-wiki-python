This has been a slower month for Jython, with the release of 2.5.1 occurring last month the developers are actively working on a 2.5.2 release.  There were many blogs and a web services article that are featured in this month's newsletter.  I hope that you enjoy this month's issue, and please feel free to send me suggestions, questions, or feedback.

Thanks
