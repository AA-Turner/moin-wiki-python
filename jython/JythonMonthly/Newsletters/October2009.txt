This has been a slower month for Jython, with the release of 2.5.1 occurring last month the developers are actively working on a 2.5.2 release.  There were many blogs and a web services article that are featured in this month's newsletter.  I hope that you enjoy this month's issue, and please feel free to send me suggestions, questions, or feedback.

Thanks

'''Introduction to the Web services framework for Jython'''

''Heshan T Suriyaarachchi''

The open source SOA company's (WSO2) Web services framework for Jython (WSF/Jython) provides a simple approach to creating and consuming Web services in Jython. This framework integrates the Apache Axis2 Web services engine with Jython, extending all the power and versatility of the Axis2 engine to Jython users. Now, with just a few lines of code, Jython users can enjoy the benefits of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) using Web services. Web service clients written using the WSF/Jython framework can invoke enterprise Web services that require WS-Security. WSF/Jython also supports sending binary attachments as MTOM.
