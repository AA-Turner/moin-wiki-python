Lots going on in the Jython world, as always.  There were no article submissions this month, but a couple of good articles have been posted to the web...I've linked to those below.  There is no doubt about it that Jython is on the radar again as an excellent language for the JVM.  Let's hope that the momentum continues!

If you have any questions or comments regarding this month's newsletter, please feel free to send them to me.
