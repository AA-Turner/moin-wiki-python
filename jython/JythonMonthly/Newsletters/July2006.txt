Welcome to the first issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  I hope that you are able to find some content which will interest you.  I look forward to editing and distributing this newsletter monthly, and I hope you look forward to reading it.

=== Standalone mode - Libraries included ===

''Submitted by: Oti''


Jython has now a standalone mode, where the core part is all included in one single `jython.jar` file. This has two advantages:
 * simpler starting: `java -jar jython.jar`
 * simpler embedding: just put `jython.jar` onto your classpath. No setting of `python.home` nor `python.path` required.
This really adds a Plug & Play feature to Jython.

There is a preview available ([http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ohumbel/jython_2837.jar snapshot build]).

A sample install and run session, after downloading `jython_2837.jar`:
{{{
[root@localhost downloads]# java -jar jython_2837.jar -s -d /tmp/jython_standalone -t standalone

One Open issue: the cachedir problem still remains. If the directory containing `jython.jar` is not writable, no cachedir will help importing java classes. This is a well known problem also persistent in non-standalone mode. We try to improve this in standalone mode.

= Tips and Tricks =

=== Jython Function Behavior ===

A useful thing to note about defining Jython functions with keyword parameters:
The default values are only created once, at function compilation-time. 

For instance,  if the default value you’re supplying is MyClass(5, 6, 7), you might be surprised to discover 
that the same instance gets used with every function call.

This trick can be used to make an equivalent to C’s static local variables. Try this:
{{{
def foo(item, acc=[]):
    acc.append(item)
    return accNow, call foo a few times with only a single argument.
}}}

{{{
>>> foo(5)
[5]
>>> foo(6)
[5, 6]
>>> foo(7)
[5, 6, 7]
}}}
I’m sure there are much more interesting uses for this than my contrived little example, but you get the idea.

=== How to use the Wiki ===

Learn to use the Jython wiki for posting articles and tutorials.  Help and build the Jython library!
Wiki renders as html and can use css and images.  It is a great tool for posting content quickly in 
an organized environment.  Create an account and use the wiki help to get started today.

Here is an example provided by Clark Updike:

Here's the main page (rendered as HTML):

Test your skills with the Coolaps Developer Challenge:
There are two ways to compete - the best application that runs on Sun Grid Compute Utility, 
and the best application built with the Compute Server Plugin for NetBeans. 
We designed things this way to allow as many people as possible to participate, including International participants, 
who cannot access the Sun Grid Compute Utility today.

=== Question from leouser to the community ===

Id like to compile a list of things that
would improve it and am curious if there are any users out there in the general Jython community that have any ideas.

I have one:
1. Let the user alter the font from the GUI. After taking the shell to different platforms, Ive come to the conclusion that just using the supplied font is not always a good thing.  Im considering adding a font chooser panel.  Something at least that will let the user change the blasted font.

Any other ideas?  ''Please send thoughts to the Jython-Users list''

== Dojo Toolkit ==

The Dojo Javascript Toolkit is utilizing Jython's ANT capabilites for their build process.  Take a look at this powerful toolkit...it is worth the time!
