'''Jython'''

''Jim Baker and Tobias Ivarsson''

In this presentation we will show you what you can do with Jython. In particular we will show what the soon-to-be-released version 2.5 enables. This includes web frameworks such as Django, scientific applications such as SymPy and everything down to installation and dependency management systems for Python packages. We will show demonstrations of Django running in Jython, WAR-file deployment of Django applications, applications integrating Python libraries and Java libraries as well as the power of exploring a Java package from the interactive object shell of Jython.
