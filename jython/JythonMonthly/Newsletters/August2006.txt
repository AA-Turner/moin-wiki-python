||'''August 2006 -- Issue #2''' ||||

Welcome to the another issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  I want to encourage the readers of Jython Monthly to send any articles, tips, tricks, or any other Jython related material to me if you think it should be distributed with this newsletter.

Test your skills with the Coolaps Developer Challenge:
There are two ways to compete - the best application that runs on Sun Grid Compute Utility, 
and the best application built with the Compute Server Plugin for NetBeans. 
We designed things this way to allow as many people as possible to participate, including International participants, 
who cannot access the Sun Grid Compute Utility today.
