== News ==

'''Jython 2.5b4 Released'''

The fifth beta for the 2.5 version of Jython has been released.

Per Frank Wierzbicki:

Jython 2.5b4 is available for download here:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jython/jython_installer-2.5b4.jar.
See the installation instructions here:
http://www.jython.org/Project/installation.html.

While no new features have been added since Beta 3, we have fixed a
number of bugs. One of the bugs prompted an almost total re-write of
our Tuple and List implementations, which is the reason that this is
another beta and not a release candidate. Expect a release candidate
real soon now.

We also applied a patch that allows Jython to function in a system
that does not have write access to the filesystem so that Jython can
run unpatched in Google App Engine.  See here for more:
http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-java/web/will-it-play-in-app-engine.

This is a beta release so be careful.

'''Django-Jython 1.0b1 Released'''

This is a great milestone for the Django-Jython project.  This project is focused on implementing Django on the Jython language and ensuring that the databases function correctly with Django on Jython.  Release notes state that modjy integration and war management command are updated to work with Jython 2.5b2 and later.  Added junitxmlrunner, a Django test runner for producing JUnit compatible XML output.  WAR command has been updated changing --include-py-libs option by renaming it to --include-py-path-entries to avoid misinterpretations.  Also, numerous bug fixes have been made.

Currently supporting only PostgreSQL database, but look for more in the near future.
