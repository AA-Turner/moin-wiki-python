'''Django-Jython 1.1.1 Released'''

The Django-Jython project has released version 1.1.1.  This release includes some bug fixes along with a couple of new features.  New features include JNDI support and WAR file creation adjustments which allow for Django-Jython libraries to be excluded from the WAR and added to the application server libraries.  For more details, [[http://code.google.com/p/django-jython/|visit the site]]!

'''Sikuli Project Released'''

Sikuli is a visual technology to search and automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) using images (screenshots). The first release of Sikuli contains Sikuli Script, a visual scripting API for Jython, and Sikuli IDE, an integrated development environment for writing visual scripts with screenshots easily. Sikuli Script automates anything you see on the screen without internal API's support. You can programmatically control a web page, a desktop application running on Windows/Linux/Mac OS X, or even an iphone application running in an emulator.  To read more, see the site at [[http://sikuli.org|sikuli.org]].

'''PyDev 1.5.4 Released'''

PyDev is an Eclipse plugin for working performing Python, Jython, and IronPython development.  Version 1.5.4 has been released and includes many enhancements.  For a list of new features, please visit the [[http://pydev.org|pydev site]].

[[http://articles.softwarereality.com/2010/01/music-to-program-to.html|Music to Program To]] - Matt Stephens

What types of music – genres, bands, composers – are best for programming?

The well-known “Mozart effect” suggests that listening to the great man’s music can improve your concentration and help you to make intuitive leaps… making his music perfect for programming to, surely? The study itself has been brought into question, but besides, Mozart doesn’t always hit the right note (so to speak). Programming isn’t just a single activity – different tasks take a different type of thought, so it follows that each needs a different style of music to nudge your brain into the right gear.

I am currently experimenting jython in order to do pdf files manipulations. I encountered several problems and I want to share some of the solutions (time to give back). [[http://fraka6.blogspot.com/2010/01/jython-pypdf-reportlab-experimentation.html|Read More]]

I recently had the opportunity to review the recently published WebSphere Application Server Administration Using Jython from IBM Press and thought I would share my opinions on this book. In the spirit of full disclosure, I was provided a copy of the book to review at no cost to myself. [[http://webspherecommunity.blogspot.com/2010/01/websphere-application-server.html|Read More]]

[[http://blog.leosoto.com/2010/01/django-jython-111-released.html|Django-Jython 1.1.1 Released]] - Leo Soto

Sounds like we are doing one release per month! Django-Jython 1.1.1 is now available, almost exactly one month after 1.1.0. Which is something I didn't expect this time, as I've been really busy with my thesis and other stuff. Fortunately, open source software has this extraordinary property of letting a community move a project forward. [[http://blog.leosoto.com/2010/01/django-jython-111-released.html|Read More]]

Are you interested?  I’m looking at bringing the same style product that we’ve been delivering to the Groovy community to the JRuby and Jython communities, respectively.  If there’s enough interest, we’ll move forward.  [[http://michaelkimsal.com/blog/magazines-targeting-jruby-and-jython/|Read More and Express Interst]]

I have a group that is about ready to start a new Dungeons and Dragons campaign. The last time we played was somewhere between 2 and 4 years ago. Since then, Wizards of the Coast has release the 4th edition of the system. In addition to that, they have released a character creator, which has made creating and leveling up characters super easy.

There is a very friendly and pretty cool project called 'Sikuli' and the authors are from Taiwan too. What is Sikuli? I copy these texts from its website. Sikuli is a visual technology to search and automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) using images (screenshots). The first release of Sikuli contains Sikuli Script, a visual scripting API for Jython, and Sikuli IDE, an integrated development environment for writing visual scripts with screenshots easily.

An embedded script engine is a great way to empower an application's users with the ability to customize and extend tools, and java's JSR223 ScriptEngine framework makes it easy to implement. [[http://littleware.blogspot.com/2010/01/jython-scriptengine-with-webstart.html|Read More]]

I'm really not sure what to think about this yet: Sikuli "is a visual technology to search and automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) using images (screenshots)". In the demo on their homepage, they use Sikuli to configure the IP settings on a Mac going through the standard System Preferences app. [[http://jdfrens.blogspot.com/2010/01/programming-with-screenshots.html|Read More]]

'''[[http://dustinamrhein.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/changing-cell-names-node-names-host-names/|Changing Cell Names, Node Names, Host Names]] - Dustin's Blog'''

It seems like I get asked quite a bit about how to change cell names, node names, and host names for a given WebSphere Application Server environment. It usually starts by someone asking me what configuration files they need to change when they want to update this information, and is followed by their surprise when I tell them none. The reason I say that is because it’s time consuming, hard, and unnecessary for you to figure this out. Instead, you can use three simple wsadmin commands. I’ll give you an example of those here (all written in Jython). [[http://dustinamrhein.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/changing-cell-names-node-names-host-names/|Read More]]

'''[[http://jlorenzen.blogspot.com/2010/01/precompiling-jsps-for-websphere-61.html|Precompiling JSPs for Websphere 6.1]] - James Lorenzen'''

For the past week I have been trying to get precompiled JSPs working for WebSphere 6.1, because our target environment does not include the Java Development Kit (JDK) for security reasons. The following is a brief explanation on how to precompile JSPs for WebSphere 6.1 using maven2. And as an added bonus, I'll also explain how to use the maven-was6-plugin to automate deployment of a WAR using Jython.

SpringSource has has just announced last  week of a milestone release of SpringPython 1.1.0.M1. This announcement made aware about this project. There is a project that has nearly reached its 1.1 version that tries to develop Spring-like framework in Python. I would like to look into this project.
