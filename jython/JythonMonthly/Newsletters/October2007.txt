== Distributing Jython Scripts ==

''Submitted By: Greg Moore''

There are several ways to accomplish this, but the following text will only cover distributing code you've written so others with out a Jython installation can use them without having to use jythonc. If someone wants to cover deployment to a web app server or embedded deployment, please do! These are beyond the scope of this text and more importantly my personal knowledge.

== Parsing and Writing RSS Using Jython and Rome ==

''Submitted By: Josh Juneau''

RSS is an old technology now...it has been around for years. However, it is a technology which remains very useful for disseminating news and other information. The ROME project on java.net is helping to make parsing, generating, and publishing RSS and Atom feeds a breeze for any Java developer.

Since I am particularly fond of translating Java to Jython code, I've taken simple examples from the Project ROME wiki and translated Java RSS reader and writer code into Jython. It is quite easy to do, and it only takes a few lines of code.
