This is the Jython Monthly newsletter for the months of December 2010 and January of 2011.  Jython 2.5.2 RC3 has been released to the Jython community for review.  Please download and test now if you haven't done so already!  There is a significant amount of material to cover for this issue.  I will be unable to record a podcast due to some timing issues, so I apologize for that.  I am hoping to get back into the monthly schedule for releasing the newsletter and podcast at some point.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the newsletter, please feel free to send them to jythonpodcast@gmail.com.  I appreciate the feedback!

Thanks
