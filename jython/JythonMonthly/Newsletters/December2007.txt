There are a few good articles included in this month's newsletter.  Rob Andrews has written another helpful article on Jython.  There was an excellent article published on Javaworld regarding scripting on the Java platform.  Lastly, there is a helpful article for those who are interested in using JavaFX with Jython.  

I hope that everyone enjoys the holiday season and takes some time to relax with their loved ones.  Seasons greetings to everyone!

Most of the day-to-day programming I see in the real world does not consist of 50,000-line applications. And even the larger applications consist of functions and smaller blocks of code that work together to produce the more sophisticated behavior of the larger application.

I advise novice programmers to master smaller common tasks, such as handling text, files, and directories. The skills learned in so doing will be used over and over, even in more specialized software development later on.

The following is a very simple example of a common task. Each line in the file "states.txt" begins with a two-letter state abbreviation of the variety we use here in the U.S.

== Using JavaFX in Jython Applications ==

''By:  Josh Juneau''

Have you heard about JavaFX script yet? Of course you have, it is one of the hottest topics in the Java world today. Although in it's early stages, JavaFX script proves to be an easily learned and powerful scripting language addition to the Java community. It gives one the ability to easily create Java animations and Swing applications without coding any Java at all. However, sometimes it is still useful to combine Java and JavaFX to create more robust applications. For example, if one wishes to build an RSS reader using JavaFX then it is still handy to use the Java language for performing RSS parsing. This is because JavaFX script seems to be more targeted at creating user interfaces than for core Java programming.
