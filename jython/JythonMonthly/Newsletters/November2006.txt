'''''In Progress'''''

Welcome to the Novemberber 2006 issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  I want to encourage the readers of Jython Monthly to send any articles, tips, tricks, or any other Jython related material to me if you think it should be distributed with this newsletter.

Jython content was lacking a bit this month, so please send article ideas if you have them.
