||'''November 2007 -- Issue #12''' ||||

This month the newsletter is a bit slim as there were not many new articles or Jython topics to report.  However, there has been a new release of Jython which contains many bug fixes...Jython 2.2.1 has been released.

There has been lots of hype in the Java community regarding JavaFX technology.  I was going to try and create some Jython/JavaFX demos for this month, but time unfortunately time ran away from me.  I think it would be great to see some articles or tutorials showing Jython's interaction with the new JavaFX libraries.  In the least, it would be nice to write a Jython applet which invokes a JavaFX script.  I would like to encourage anyone who is interested to write about this topic for next month's newsletter.

Thanks for reading this month's newsletter.  Let's keep the Jython community growing by writing more blogs and articles about this excellent language.

Enjoy-

''Submitted By: Rob Andrews''

Jython is more than just an implementation of Python syntax in Java. It actually makes available access to a library of resources from both environments.

In my first article, I emphasized syntax and ideas I felt would be of value to Java developers new to Jython's syntax and to novice programmers in general.

This month, I set out to balance the scales a bit, introducing the import of Java library resources and a more Java-oriented way to handle files.
