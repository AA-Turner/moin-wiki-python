Happy Holidays to Everyone!

We have passed the Christmas season and are about to ring in a new year.  It has been an exciting year for Jython and I know that 2009 will be another great one.  We have a lot to remember for 2008 as Jython has made some important advances of the past 12 months.  To highlight, here are just a few of the great moments for Jython in 2008:

- Sun Hires Two Key Python Developers - March 2008

- Jython 2.5 Alpha Released - July 2008

- Jython 2.5 Beta Released - October 2008

- Django Runs on Jython - Summer 2008

- Jim Baker and Leo Soto Presentation of Django on Jython at DjangoCon 2008

- PyDev and Netbeans 6.5 Provide Two Great IDEs for Jython Development

Those are just some of the highlights from the past year.  I'm sure that in 2009 we will see a 2.5 release, along with some other Jython surprises...perhaps Turbo Gears on Jython and other great possibilities!

Onto other fronts, the Jython Podcast homepage is ready.  I also have created the first podcast episode, although I would like to call it a beta since the quality has much to be desired.  I had my podcasting studio set up and ready to go, but then my good microphone took a turn for the worst and I was left with a cheaper quality microphone for this first recording.  You can pick up the podcast at www.jythonpodcast.com if you are interested in hearing episode #1.  I hope to purchase a new microphone so that in January we have a top-notch quality broadcast.

As always, I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions.  Please email me at jythonpodcast@gmail.com and let me know if you've got any commentary to add.

Thanks, and have a happy new year!
