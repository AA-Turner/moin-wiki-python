||'''April 2007 -- Issue #10''' ||||


Welcome to the April 2007 issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  Please contribute to future newsletters by writing articles or tutorials based on your experiences with Jython!

At this time, I would like to formally request a new editor to take over the Jython Monthly newsletter.  Life brings about many changes, and some recent developments in my life will drastically reduce the amount of time I have for tasks such as this.  I really enjoyed being the editor for Jython Monthly, unfortunately I will have to pass it along at this time.  If there is anyone interested in taking over as editor for the Jython Monthly newsletter, please feel free to contact me at jython-monthly@mchsi.com.  I look forward to responding to your emails!

At this time, this will be the final distribution of Jython Monthly under my care.  Thanks to all who have contributed and read the newsletter!

'''''Question:'''''

I need to redirect all stdout and stderr to files. This redirection
needs to also include the output of imported Java modules that I use.
The following example readily given on the Web only catches the
script's output, Jythons output - not external Java modules output:

sys.stdout = open("/tmp/jythonstdout", "w")
sys.stderr = open("/tmp/jythonstderr", "w")

print >> sys.stdout, "out"
# Java modules output is not captured

I then thought that I should instead use dup2, also a common example on the Web:

stdoutlog = open("/tmp/jythonstdout", "w")
stderrlog = open("/tmp/jythonstderr", "w")

os.dup2(stdoutlog.fileno(), sys.stdout.fileno())
os.dup2(stderrlog.fileno(), sys.stderr.fileno())

Unfortunately, the above code produces the following error: NameError:
name "file" is not defined. I took this as a sign that I'm supposed to
be using open() instead of file, which is said to be an alias for
file(). Except, that also generates an error:

IOError: fileno() is not supported in jpython

Can someone please steer me in the right direction?

JythonConsole 0.0.4 Released - http://code.google.com/p/jythonconsole/

'''''Pydev and Pydev Extensions 1.3.1 have been released'''''

Details on Pydev Extensions: http://www.fabioz.com/pydev
Details on Pydev: http://pydev.sf.net
Details on its development: http://pydev.blogspot.com

Release Highlights in Pydev Extensions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Interactive Console: jython process can receive vmargs (configured in the preferences page)
* Code-Completion: auto-import completions will not be brought for tokens in the current module
* Code-Completion: auto-import inserted as last import in imports list (so, __future__ imports will remain in the 1st position)
* Code-Analysis: Only adds unused parameters in methods that have some statement that is not a 'pass' or string
* Fix: Find Occurrences: will not 'overlap' occurrences anymore
* Fix: Code-Analysis: deep attribute access after finding __getattr__ does not signal unresolved import errors anymore

Release Highlights in Pydev:
----------------------------------------------

* Mylar integration: the pydev package explorer now supports mylar (packaged as a separate feature: org.python.pydev.mylar.feature )
* Code-completion: comment completion is now the same as string completion
* Debug: Breakpoints can be set in external files
* Debug: Breakpoint annotations now show in external files
* Package Explorer: filter for import nodes created
* Fix: Package Explorer Actions: Open action does not expand children when opening python file
* Fix: Project Explorer (WTP) integration: does not conflict with elements from other plugins anymore (such as java projects)
* Fix: halt in new project wizard: when creating a new project from the pydev wizard it was halting in some platforms
* Fix: ${string_prompt} in run config: now only evaluated on the actual run
* Fix: Code-Completion: jython shell was not handling java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError correctly
