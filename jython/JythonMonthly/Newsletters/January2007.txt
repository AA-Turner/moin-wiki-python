''Question from "Divya":''

I would like to parse ". java "  /   ".class"   files and detect class
name's, attributes  name's and type's (and or list of methods).

Is there any module who can parse easily a java file using jython?

''Answer from Luis:''

It would probably be easiest to work on compiled .class files and use
the reflection API.

If you have access to Java 6, you could even use the compiler API. See
the following article:

''Question from Mike:''

I'm embedding Jython in a Java servlet and have set the 'python.path' to include a directory which contains python scripts I have written and packaged. 

For example I have a folder "/package" which contains 'myscript.py' and '__init__.py'.

My servlet executes some arbitary python script which imports the module 'myscript'. The first time this happens 'myscript.py' is compiled to 'myscript$py.class' which is fine. However, if I change 'myscript.py' there is no detection of the new script and I must shutdown and restart the servlet to reload my changes. 

Is there any simple way around this?

''Answer from Leouser:''

have you tried the reload function yet?

{{{import Thing
Thing.doSomething()
#change Thing.py src
reload(Thing)
Thing.doSomething()
}}}
