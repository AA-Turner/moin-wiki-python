First and foremost, I hope that everyone is enjoying this holiday season thus far.  Hopefully you had a great Thanksgiving...my best to you all.

Frank Wierzbicki and the other Jython developers have been working hard on the development of Jython 2.5 and a beta has now been released.  Not only is the up and coming release going well, but it is also being used by much of the community already.  The the current time, I know that Frank is working on AST features.

Lots of IDE news is also hitting the web.  Netbeans has released 6.5 which has many major feature additions and improvements.  The nbPython project is also working hard to develop a fully featured Python IDE plugin for Netbeans.  Of course, the Eclipse community is continuing to see improvements in the already great [[http://pydev.sourceforge.net/|PyDev IDE]].

As you know, I am planning to begin a podcast for this newsletter and it is in the works.  Look for more information regarding the podcast on the new podcast page:  I will be posting updates to the page often so keep en eye out if you are interested.
