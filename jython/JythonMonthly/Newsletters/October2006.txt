'''''In Progress'''''

Welcome to the October 2006 issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  I want to encourage the readers of Jython Monthly to send any articles, tips, tricks, or any other Jython related material to me if you think it should be distributed with this newsletter.  

Special thanks to those who submitted material for this month's newsletter!

''From Craig W'':

   I am trying to read in some large files using Jython.  I have no problems with something under 12mb....but over 12mb, I get OutOfMemoryError: java heap space

   any suggestions on how to read in large files into Jython? 

    I tried:

    data = open('blah.zip', 'rb').read()   (where blah.zip is a 13.3MB file).

''Response by Kent Johnson'':

Did you try giving more heap space to Jython? In the batch file or 
whatever you use to launch your program, add the Java switch -Xmx512M, 
that will set the max heap to 512 MB.

Pydev and Pydev Extensions 1.2.4 have been released

Details on Pydev Extensions: http://www.fabioz.com/pydev
Details on Pydev: http://pydev.sf.net 
Details on its development: http://pydev.blogspot.com

Release Highlights in Pydev Extensions:

* Code analysis: analysis on imported modules do no longer give you errors on
    * classes that have __getattribute__ or __getattr__ overriden
    * assigns that are initially None
    * assigns to a function call and not a class definition

* Completions for parameters in a context-insensitive way, looking for all the methods/attributes declared in classes available to the project (after 3 chars)

Release Highlights in Pydev:

* Completions for parameters based on the tokens that were defined for it in a given context
* Removed the default PyLint options, because its command-line interface changed (that was crashing PyLint in newer versions)
* Changed the grammar so that 'yield' is correctly parsed as an expression
* Giving better error message when external file is opened without any interpreter selected
* Icons for the builtins gotten on large libraries (such as wx -- it was optimized not to do that before)
* Adding jars relative to the project now works correctly
