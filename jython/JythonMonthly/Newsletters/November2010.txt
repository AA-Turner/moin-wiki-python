'''In Progress...'''


This is the Jython Monthly newsletter for the months of October and November of 2010.  Jython 2.5.2 RC2 has been released to the Jython community for review.  Please download and test now if you haven't done so already!  Due to a lack of materials over the past couple of months, the newsletter will combine both October and November together.  I am hoping to get back into the monthly schedule for releasing the newsletter and podcast.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the newsletter, please feel free to send them to jythonpodcast@gmail.com.  I appreciate the feedback!

Thanks
