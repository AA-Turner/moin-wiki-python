As you have probably heard, Jython and Django are making the news!  The implementation is almost ready and there is a lot of discussion about it...see the blog segment below.

I'm very excited that PyCon 2008 will be underway shortly.  Being that I live close to Chicago, I am glad that PyCon will be in my area this year.  It sounds like there is a great lineup for PyCon, and Jython is not going to miss out.  Frank Wierzbicki will be hosting the Jython Sprint at the event.  Stay tuned for more details!
