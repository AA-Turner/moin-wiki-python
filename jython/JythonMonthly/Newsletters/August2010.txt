||<style="vertical-align: top;">'''August/September 2010 -- Issue #45''' ||<style="vertical-align: top;"> ||


This is the Jython Monthly newsletter for the months of August and September of 2010.  These are exciting times for Jython as the second beta for 2.5.2 has been released.  Please download and test now if you haven't done so already!  Due to a lack of materials over the past couple of months, the newsletter will combine both August and September together.  I plan to distribute a separate special JavaOne update after the conference as well.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the newsletter, please feel free to send them to jythonpodcast@gmail.com.  I appreciate the feedback!

Thanks
