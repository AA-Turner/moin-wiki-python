More busy times for Jython!  There have been some great progressions made in the world of Jython over the past few weeks.  One of the biggest news items is the first alpha release of Jython 2.5.  Congrats to the Jython development team on their great efforts!

Netbeans will soon have a great plugin for Python/Jython development.  The NbPython project is underway and you can obtain development downloads of the module at this time!

Thanks to all of you who participated in the "Ask Frank" interview for this month.  We have not yet processed all of the Q & A, but I do plan on distributing an extra edition of Jython Monthly once we've completed the process.  Thanks again to Frank Wierzbicki for his time!

If you have any questions or comments regarding this month's newsletter, please feel free to send them to me.
