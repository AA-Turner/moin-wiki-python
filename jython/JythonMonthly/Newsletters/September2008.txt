Django...that is one of the hottest discussions around the Jython community at this time.  Jython is popular in many different areas, but it seems as though there is an ever increasing interest in using Jython with the Django framework.  Thanks to Leo Soto, Jim Baker, and other developers who have made it possible, Django is working very well with Jython.  This is great news for Java and Python developers alike.

Also, a special thanks to Jim Baker for taking the time to answer all of the questions.  The Jython community definitely appreciates it!
