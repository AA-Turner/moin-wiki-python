Seasons Greetings!

Welcome to the December 2006 issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  

I want to encourage the readers of Jython Monthly to send any articles, tips, tricks, or any other Jython related material to me if you think it should be distributed with this newsletter.  Unfortunately, there were no article submissions for this month's edition of Jython Monthly.  Hopefully we can have better luck next month!

I wish you and your families a very happy holiday!    

- Josh Juneau

= Article Call =
 

Unfortunately, we had no article submissions for this month's newsletter.  All of the holiday activity must have had an impact on everyone's schedules.  I know it has had an impact on mine!  

I have had a recent interest in graphics and gaming development.  There are some [[http://www.smallshire.org.uk/jython3d.htm|articles]] available regarding Jython and Java3D development, but I have not been able to find many concerning Jython game development.  

As the editor of Jython Monthly, I'd like to ask those Jython graphics and gaming developers to submit an article for next month's newsletter on such a topic.  Be it a tutorial or just a simple example, it would be great to add some gaming or graphical tutorials to the online Jython library.  

Until then, enjoy the holiday season!  The next issue of Jython Monthly is scheduled to be distributed on January 9th, 2007.

= Tips and Tricks =

This is an old useful trick for referencing a static method within a Jython class.  

{{{
# direct, naive approach -- doesn't work...:
class Class1:
    def static1(name):
        print "Hello",name

# ...but now, a call such as:
Class1.static1("John")
# will fail with a TypeError, as 'static1' has become 
# an unbound-method object, not a plain function.

# This is easy to solve with a simple tiny wrapper:
class Callable:
    def __init__(self, anycallable):
        self.__call__ = anycallable

# toy-example usage:
class Class2:
    def static2(name):
        print "Hi there",name
    static2 = Callable(static2)

# now, a call such as:
Class2.static2("Peter")
# works just fine, and as-expected
}}}

Thanks to Alex Martelli for posting this recipe.
