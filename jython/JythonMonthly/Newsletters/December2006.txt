'''In Progress...'''

Seasons Greetings!

Welcome to the December 2006 issue of Jython Monthly.  The content of this newsletter will focus on using and developing the Jython languge.  

I want to encourage the readers of Jython Monthly to send any articles, tips, tricks, or any other Jython related material to me if you think it should be distributed with this newsletter.

I wish you and your families a very happy holiday!
