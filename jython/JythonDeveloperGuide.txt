This is an introduction to developing Jython, just to get someone started. It doesn't cover the source code in any depth or discuss the design behind Jython. It's purely aimed at getting a development environment set up. It's definitely not complete so feel free to make it better!

== Subversion ==

  * Check out a copy of the Jython source with [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], available on most *nix systems or with Cygwin on Windows.
  * You can use the command line tool `svn`, or [http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients GUI clients are available] on most platforms.
  * !NetBeans, Eclipse and other Java IDEs also integrate Subversion support.  Eclipse users should see JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes.
  * Browse the source code on the Web at http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/browse/jython.
  * To obtain the a copy of the ''current development'' source, check out the Jython ASM branch:
    {{{ svn co https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/branches/asm/ }}}

  * Attach patches to issues in the [http://bugs.jython.org/ Jython bug tracker].

== Ant ==

  * [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant] is a Java-based tool used to build Jython from source.
  * Eclipse users, see [wiki:Self:/EclipseNotes#ANT Eclipse Ant notes]
  * Download the latest version and install it so Ant's `bin` directory is somewhere in your path.
  * To build Jython, run `ant` in the top-level Jython directory (which contains the Ant file `build.xml`).
  * The results of the build appear in the `dist` subdirectory.

== Tests ==
The Jython build process generates an executable Bash script, `dist/bin/jython`, to make it easy to launch your build of Jython. It works on Unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X and Cygwin).

If you're using Windows without Cygwin, use the batch file `dist/bin/jython.bat` instead.

Now you're ready to run tests...

  * There are a couple different places to find test cases
    * Jython's `dist/Lib/test` (populated by the build process)
    * Jython's `bugtests` subdirectory (included with the development sources)
  * Run a particular test, or the whole Python test suite with `ant regrtest`.

See TestingJython for some more details.

== Directory layout ==
Note the following describes the current trunk/jython. If you are working from an older tag, src doesn't exist and src/com and src/org are moved up a level. 

  * `src/org`      : top level package for python
  * `src/com`      : zxJDBC related sources
  * `src/shell`    : launcher scripts
  * `src/templates`: java source generator & related templates, used to update portions of java classes elsewhere in the source tree
  * `Demo`         : demo sources for the website and such
  * `Doc`          : the website documentation (see /WebsiteBuilderSetup to build the http://jython.org website)
  * `Lib`          : the python source files for Jython standard library implementations
  * `Lib/test`     : test cases
  * `Misc`         : random scripts which are not all used; some generate source
  * `Tools`        : JythonC and Freeze
  * `CPythonLib`   : Lib directory from the corresponding version of cpython, via svn:externals
  * `bugtests`     : additional test cases covering bug reports
