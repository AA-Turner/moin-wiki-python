This is an introduction to developing Jython, just to get someone started. It doesn't cover the source code in any depth or discuss the design behind Jython. It's purely aimed at getting a development environment set up. It's definitely not complete so feel free to make it better!

== Mercurial ==

  * Check out a copy of the Jython source with [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/|Mercurial]], available on most *nix systems or with Cygwin on Windows.
  * You can use the command line tool `hg`, or [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/OtherTools#Graphical_user_interfaces|GUI clients are available]] on most platforms.
  * !NetBeans, Eclipse and other Java IDEs also integrate Mercurial support.  Eclipse users should see JythonDeveloperGuide/EclipseNotes.
  * Browse the source code on the Web at http://hg.python.org/jython or at the official mirror on BitBucket, at http://bitbucket.org/jython/jython.
  * To obtain the a copy of the ''current development'' source, clone the repo via:
    {{{ hg clone http://hg.python.org/jython }}}
  * It's easy to create your own fork of the repo on BitBucket, visit http://bitbucket.org/jython/jython and click on 'Fork'
  * Attach patches to issues in the [[http://bugs.jython.org/|Jython bug tracker]].
    * Also, you can upload them to http://codereview.appspot.com (the Jython repository is already registered).

== Subversion ==

Although development has moved to a Mercurial repository, at the time of this writing (July 2011), you still need [[http://subversion.apache.org | Subversion]] installed. This is because the Mercurial repository named above
continues to reference a part of the CPython source at {{{ https://svn.python.org }}} as a "sub-repository".

The following advice is based on experience using Mercurial 1.9, [[http://sliksvn.com| Slik Subversion]] and Windows 7 (AMDx64). Other tools and operating systems exist. An installation
that gives you the command 'svn' on your path is sufficient.

If you do not have Subversion installed (and on the PATH) the Mercurial {{{hg clone}}} command will terminate with the message: {{{
abort: The system cannot find the file specified
}}}
at the point where it attempts to read the sub-repository, specified in the files {{{ .hgsub }}} and {{{ .hgsubstate }}}.

A second requirement is that Subversion should accept the SSL certificate from the site svn.python.org. If you have
not used Subversion already to access the site, you may find that the {{{ hg clone }}} command hangs at the point where it attempts to read the sub-repository. A simple solution is to visit the site once from the command line as follows: {{{
svn info https://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/
}}}
Subversion will issue a warning about the certificate, and you will be able to "accept permanently" the site's certificate. The Mercurial clone operation should not now hang.

If you see the sub-directory {{{ CPythonLib }}} created in your local repository, then the call to Subversion by Mercurial was a success. (It can take a few minutes to complete.)


== Ant ==

  * [[http://ant.apache.org/|Ant]] is a Java-based tool used to build Jython from source.
  * Eclipse users, see [[/EclipseNotes#ANT|Eclipse Ant notes]]
  * Download the latest version (Jython requires Ant 1.7 or later to build) and install it so Ant's `bin` directory is somewhere in your path.
  * To build Jython, run `ant` in the top-level Jython directory (which contains the Ant file `build.xml`).
  * The results of the build appear in the `dist` subdirectory.

== Tests ==
The Jython build process generates an executable Bash script, `dist/bin/jython`, to make it easy to launch your build of Jython. It works on Unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X and Cygwin).

If you're using Windows without Cygwin, use the batch file `dist/bin/jython.bat` instead.

Now you're ready to run tests...

  * There are a couple different places to find test cases
    * Jython's `dist/Lib/test` (populated by the build process)
    * Jython's `bugtests` subdirectory (included with the development sources)
  * Run a particular test, or the whole Python test suite with `ant regrtest`.

See TestingJython for some more details.

== Directory layout ==
Note the following describes the current trunk/jython. If you are working from an older tag, src doesn't exist and src/com and src/org are moved up a level.

  * `src/org`      : top level package for python
  * `src/com`      : zxJDBC related sources
  * `src/shell`    : launcher scripts
  * `src/templates`: java source generator & related templates, used to update portions of java classes elsewhere in the source tree
  * `Demo`         : demo sources for the website and such
  * `Doc`          : the website documentation (see /WebsiteBuilderSetup to build the http://jython.org website)
  * `Lib`          : the python source files for Jython standard library implementations
  * `Lib/test`     : test cases
  * `Misc`         : random scripts which are not all used; some generate source
  * `Tools`        : JythonC and Freeze
  * `CPythonLib`   : Lib directory from the corresponding version of cpython, via svn:externals
  * `bugtests`     : additional test cases covering bug reports
