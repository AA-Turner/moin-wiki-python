I am a current jython committer, and have contributed 

   1. A NewSocketModule with
      * Timeout support
      * Asynchronous support
      * Client side SSL support

   1. A SelectModule with
      * Support for the select function
      * Support for poll objects

I will address any jython issues relating to these modules, or modules that use them, such httplib, ftplib, telnetlib, etc, etc.

I can be contacted at <jython-dev at xhaus dot com>
