NateYoung is a Java programmer who recently finished the book "Learning
Python" and got very excited about the language in a way that he
hasn't been since, well, since he learned Java.

He works for a large, faceless, proprietary company by day, so he's
very interested in Open Source Software and exorcising some of the
stigmas his corporate workplace has against free software.  Jython
seemed like a natural point to delve into those interests.


He's been reading the wiki and some of the mail archives, hopefully
he'll come up to speed quickly and be able to pitch in where help is
needed.
