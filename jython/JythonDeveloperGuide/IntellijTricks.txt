== Eclipse Code Formatter ==

Configuring the [[CodingStandards]] by hand is an annoying task. Fortunately there is a plugin to import Eclipse code formatting rules into Intellij IDEA: Eclipse Code Formatter. It is available in the plugin repository.

The Eclipse Code Styles file is attached to the [[CodingStandards]] page.

Eclipse Code Formatter can be configured under ''Settings'' (shortcut: ctrl + alt + s) --> ''Eclipse Code Formatter''
