= Intellij project creation notes =

Jython is an ant project. This makes it a bit difficult to import into Intellij IDEA.

<<TableOfContents()>>

== Prequisites ==

=== Software packages (outside Intellij) ===

 * ant
 * mercurial
 * Java JDK
 * Python 2.7
 * Intellij IDEA 12 (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

There is a free "Community Edition" of Intellij that might work (I'm only unsure about the Python integration). However as I (sven) use the Ultimate Edition, this tutorial is tested with this edition.

Intellij offers free IDEA licenses for Open Source projects. Perhaps it might be a good idea to apply for them.

=== Intellij Plugins ===
 * Ant Support (Bundled)
 * Eclipse Integration (Bundled)
 * hg4idea (Bundled)
 * Python (Custom, i.e. must be installed from Intellij plugin repository) 

Of course there are many other useful plugins, but these four are essential for importing Jython into Intellij IDEA.

== Steps ==

=== Make a clean checkout ===
{{{#!highlight bash
hg clone http://bitbucket.org/jython/jython jython
}}}

=== Remove Intellij files from jython ===
Change into the jython directory:
{{{#!highlight bash
cd jython
}}}

Remove files:
{{{#!highlight bash
rm -rf .idea/
rm Jython27.iml
}}}


=== Run ant ===
Run this in the jython source directory (if you made the previous step, you're already there):

{{{#!highlight bash
ant
}}}

=== Import jython as Eclipse-Project in Intellij IDEA ===

Start Intellij IDEA. Close the last open project (if there's any), to get to the start screen.

Choose:
 1. Import Project
 1. Import project from external model --> Eclipse
