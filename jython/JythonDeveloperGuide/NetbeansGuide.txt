== Building Jython with Netbeans ==
 ''Submitted by Josh Juneau on 6/10/2006''
 
This is a step-by-step guide to show how you may set up a Jython build using Netbeans.  I used NetBeans 5.5 (beta) for this tutorial.

Since this is a guide which is specific to NetBeans, I will only briefly touch upon the procedures for obtaining the code and all of the 
required JAR files.

 *'''OBTAIN NECESSARY CODE AND JAR LIBRARIES

 1.  Obtain the code:
	- If you do not have Subversion, you will need to download it and then check out the codebase.  See the JythonDeveloperGuide
	  for complete details.

 2.  Obtain required JAR files:
	- You will need to obtain the following five JAR files to successfully build Jython:
		Apache Ant - 		ant.jar
		Oracle JDBC - 		classes12.jar
		Java Readline- 		libreadline-java-0.8.0.jar
			'''''easiest to obtain by extracting from another application 
		
                   '''''Find a listing of applications: [http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/]

 		Informix JDBC-		ifxjdbc.jar
			''''' You will need to sign up for an IBM account (free) to obtain 
		Java EE or J2EE	javaee.jar 
					or 
					j2ee.jar

 *'''NOW YOU ARE READY TO BUILD JYTHON IN NETBEANS


 1.  Create a new project within Netbeans and name it "Jython".
	- Be sure to uncheck the "Create Main Class" box upon creation.  

 2.  Copy all code which resides within the Jython code you've obtained using Subversion.  Copy this code into your project:  ''Jython->src'' 
    directory.

 3.  Copy all required JARs within that same directory. You will now have all of the source appearing within Netbeans.


 4.  Add all appropriate JARs into your classpath via the Libraries option within the project properties and set the source level you will use to 
    run Jython.

 5.  Build Jython and begin to develop.  It may be helpful to set up a shortcut (or batch script in Windows) to your jython build:  
     Example:
{{{
	REM File: JythonBuild.bat
	REM ** Executable for desktop **
	java -jar "<<path to codebase>>\Jython\dist\Jython.jar"
}}}
 You should see something that looks like this:
{{{
init:
deps-clean:
Deleting directory C:\j2ee_dev\Jython\build
Deleting directory C:\j2ee_dev\Jython\dist
clean:
init:
deps-jar:

To run this application from the command line without Ant, try:
java -jar "C:\j2ee_dev\Jython\dist\Jython.jar"
jar:
