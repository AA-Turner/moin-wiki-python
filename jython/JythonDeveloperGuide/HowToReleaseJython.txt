These are just some rough notes on the steps needed to make a full release of Jython.  I generally run ant full-build as a test beforehand, as well as testing many of these steps throughout, but since that isn't strictly necessary I'm not including it here.  full-build requires all of the optional jars for the build be available and named in ant.properties.  See build.xml for more information.

 1. Update files in trunk that have information on the current version
  1. PySystemState.java
  1. build.xml

 1. Copy trunk and installer to a tag
  1. make svn tag dir
  1. svn cp trunk/jython into tag dir
  1. svn cp trunk/installer into tag dir
 1. build from tag
  1. svn co tag release_checkout
  1. cp ant.properties into release_checkout/jython
  1. ant full-build in release_checkout/jython
 1. upload installer
  1. go to Admin/File Release on sourceforge
  1. Click on Add release next to the jython package

  1. associate the uploaded file with the new release
 1. update files in the website that reference the current release
  1. news.txt
  1. download.txt
  1. index.txt
  1. installation.txt
  1. userfaq.txt
