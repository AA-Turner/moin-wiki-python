= Setting up the jython development environment in Eclipse =
Eclipse is a CVS client and can be used to get the project from the repository.  It takes a few steps to set it up, but seems to work nice once you do.  Please correct any mistakes.  (Works for Eclipse 3.0.1)

== Creating the project using CVS ==
[[Anchor(CVS)]]
At a high level, you need to:
 *Create a new java project (`<yourProjectName>`)
 *Create another project using the `Checkout Projects from CVS` option
  You won't end up with 2 projects, you'll use `Check out into an existing project` to check out the jython module and put it in the first project.
 *Set up the source folder to only include ./org and ./com

== Detailed Steps ==
 *Create the new java project, (`<yourProjectName>`)
 *Check out the jython module into `<yourProjectName>`
  *`File -> New -> New Project -> CVS folder (expand) -> Checkout Projects from CVS -> Next`
  *Set up the repository properties
   *Host: `cvs.sourceforge.net`
   *Repository Path: `/cvsroot/jython`
   *User: `anonymous`
   *Password: <leave blank>
   *Connection type: `pserver`
   *Use Default Port <the default>
   *Click `Next`
  *Create the project
   *Select `Use an existing module (..)`
   *Select `jython`
   *Click `Next`
   *Select `Check out into an existing project` [[FootNote(I tried using `Check out as a project configured using the New Project Wizard` but it put me in an endless loop.)]]
   *Click `Next`
   *Use the browser to pick `<yourProjectName>`
   *Click `Next`
  *Now, scan files from the repository to find tags from the repository by scanning them from files>
   *Select `HEAD` 
   *Click `Configure Tags`
   *Drill down into `org.python.core` and select `__builtin__.java`
   You should see a list of tags (`Versions`, `Branches`)checked in the upper right hand pane.
   *Click `Add Checked Tags` to make the CVS plugin aware of them
   *Click `OK`
   Eclipse scans the selected file and pulls out all of the available tags.
  *Checkout the tag you want into the project
   *Select the branch or version you want (drill down)
   *Click `Finish`
 *Set up source folders for the project
  You only want the `com` and `org` folders under `<yourProjectName>/jython/` to be set as source folder, otherwise things will be messy.  To do this, set up `Include` filters:
  *Access the properties of `<yourProjectName>` (Right-click on the project and select `Properties`)
  *Click on `Java Build Path` and select the `Source` tab
  *If you have anything configured besides `<yourProjectName>/jython`, remove it.
  *If you don't have `<yourProjectName>/jython`, click `Add Folder` and browse to it to add it.
  *KEY: Don't click `OK` yet, you need to first add filters
   *Click on the `+` sign next to `<yourProjectName>/jython`
   *Select the `Included:` entry
   *Click `Edit` then `Add Multiple` and browse to add the `com` and `org` directories.
== Building the project using ANT ==
[[Anchor(ANT)]]
At this point, you should be able to build the project using Eclipse's `Java Builder`.  This will only compile the classes though --you'll want to use `<yourProjectName>/jython/build.xml` to get the full ant build.  To do this:
 *First, set up an `ant.properties` file to supply "parameters" to `build.xml`
  *Put the file directly under `<yourProjectName>/jython`.  It seems like it '''must''' be in the same directory as `build.xml`.  Eclipse seems to let you specify other locations, but I couldn't ever get it to work unless it was right along side `build.xml`.  If anyone knows why, please add details.
  *Put in info such as
{{{
    build.compiler=modern
    debug=false
    #debuglevel=lines,vars,source
    optimize=false

    #javaccHome=/Users/bzimmer/Library/Java/Extras/javacc-3.2

    ht2html.dir=
    #python.home=
    python.lib=<pythonHome>\\Lib
    python.exe=<pythonHome>\\

    ### zxJDBC ###
    #oracle.jar=
    #mysql.jar=/Users/bzimmer/Library/Java/Extras/mysql-connector-java-3.1.6-bin.jar
    #informix.jar=
    #postgresql.jar=/Users/bzimmer/Library/Java/Extras/pg74.215.jdbc2.jar
    #jdbc.jar=
    #servlet.jar=
}}}
  I left stuff commented out, but you can see how you can add jars, etc. using this file.
 *Navigate to `build.xml` and Right-Click and select `Run` | `External Tools`.
 *Select `New` and on the `Main` tab
  *For `Buildfile:`, the default of `${workspace_loc:/<yourProjectName>/jython/build.xml}` should be fine
  *For `Base Directory:`, click `Browse Workspace` and navigate to the `<yourProjectName>/jython` directory and select it
  *Click on the `Properties` tab 
  *Unselect the `Use global properties as specified...` check box
  *Click the `Add External` button and navigate to and select `<yourProjectName>/ant.properties`
  *Select `Apply` and `Run`

A successful build should output something like the following:
{{{
Buildfile: c:\workspace\JythonTip\jython\build.xml
init:
     [echo] --- Build environment for jython ---
     [echo] --- Flags (Note: If the {property name} is displayed,
     [echo] --- then the component is not present)
     [echo] --- Optional Libraries ---
     [echo] java2 coll  = true
     [echo] servlet     = ${servlet.present}
     [echo] readline    = ${readline.present}
     [echo] oracle      = ${oracle.present}

     [echo] jndi        = true
     [echo] jdbc        = true
     [echo] jdbc3.0     = true

compile:
jar:
   [delete] Deleting: C:\workspace\JythonTip\jython\build\mainClass.mf
copy-xml:
copy-dist:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds
}}}
Note that this sample was actually a re-build, so it didn't do that much (you'll see more output on the first build) and ran pretty fast (2 seconds).  Also, note that I did not link in the optional "user-supply-able" jars.  To do so, just add those entries to your ant.properties (look for the placeholders).

Also, you can specify the ant targets that you want to run using the `Targets` tab under `External Tools` dialog.  For example, the `copy-dist` seems to run by default.  To force a full build, check the `all` target.

And here is a [wiki:Self:/JythonDeveloperGuide#sampleBatch sample batch file (windows)] that runs the eclipse-built jython.jar
