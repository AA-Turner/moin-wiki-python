 1. Run the checkout and ant build steps from the regular JythonDeveloperGuide
 1. In your Eclipse preferences, go to Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables and add a new variable named ANT_HOME that points to your ant install.  That directory should have a lib/ant.jar inside of it.
 1. Go to File > Import > General > "Existing Projects into Workspace" in Eclipse
 1. Select your Jython checkout directory as the root

This could be made to work entirely in Eclipse with a few more additions to the external builders.  For now, it requires running ant in the first step to make the build/gensrc and build/jarjar directories and then every time after a clean.
