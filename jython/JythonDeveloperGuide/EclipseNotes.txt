= Jython via CVS in Eclipse =
Eclipse is a CVS client and can be used to get the project from the repository.  It takes a few steps to set it up, but seems to work nice once you do.  Please correct any mistakes.  (Works for Eclipse 3.0.1)

 *`File -> New -> New Project -> CVS folder (expand) -> Checkout Projects from CVS -> Next`
 *Set up the repository properties
  *Host: `cvs.sourceforge.net`
  *Repository Path: `/cvsroot/jython`
  *User: `anonymous`
  *Password: <leave blank>
  *Connection type: `pserver`
  *Use Default Port <the default>
  *Click `Next`
 *Create the project
  *Select `Use an existing module (..)`
  *Select `jython`
  *Click `Next`
  *Select `Check out as a project in the workspace` [[FootNote(I tried using `Check out as a project configured using the New Project Wizard` but it put me in an endless loop.)]]
  *Click `Next`
  *Click `Next`
 *Now, scan files from the repository to find tags from the repository by scanning them from files>
  *Select `HEAD` 
  *Click `Configure Tags`
  *Drill down into `org.python.core` and select `__builtin__.java`
   You should see a list of tags (`Versions`, `Branches`)checked in the upper right hand pane.
  *Click `Add Checked Tags` to make the CVS plugin aware of them
  *Click `OK`
  Eclipse scans the selected file and pulls out all of the available tags.
 *Checkout the tag you want into the project
  *Select the branch or version you want (drill down)
  *Click `Finish`
