= Setting up the jython development environment in Eclipse with Subclipse =

Another way (see EclipseNotes) to obtain the jython sources to Eclipse is to use the Subclipse plugin (Subversion for Eclipse). (I'm not sure whether sf.net has some 
temporary technical problems right now, but at least I wasn't able get
the sources via CVS at all.)

This advice is applicable to Eclipse 3.2, but might work for previous 
releases too.

== Installing the Subclipse plugin ==

 * Go to Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install...
 * Go to Search for new features to install
 * Add a new remote site: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x (see http://subclipse.tigris.org/callisto.html for more details)
 * Install the plugin by selecting the product from the subclipse site.

== Checking out the Jython project ==

 * Switch to SVN Repository Exploring perspective
 * Add a new SVN repository, URL: https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython
 * Select trunk/jython from the repository tree and Checkout the project as usual.
