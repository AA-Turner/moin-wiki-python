Windows regrtest failures
=========================

5 tests failed:
    test_classpathimporter test_java_integration test_old_mailbox
    test_popen test_shutil

* test_classpathimporter - file handles, though not a straightforward fix, org.python.core.ClasspathPyImporter is the culprit
* test_java_integration - jython.bat needs (or 'should' as there's absolutely nothing subprocess can do about it) to strip surrounding quotes from command line arguments
* test_old_mailbox - file handles?
* test_popen - http://bugs.python.org/issue1559298
* test_shutil - apparently java.io.File.delete completely ignores ntfs permissions set by test_on_error???

Also test_mailbox fails horribly and is temporarily disabled from regrtest --expected
