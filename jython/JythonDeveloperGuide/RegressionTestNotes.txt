Windows regrtest failures
=========================

11 fails unexpected:
    test_classpathimporter test_gettext test_java_integration
    test_marshal test_netrc test_old_mailbox test_pkgimport
    test_popen test_shutil test_tarfile test_urllib2

* test_classpathimporter - file handles
* test_gettext - ?
* test_java_integration - jython.bat file needs (doesn't 'need' to but seems the only way around this as there's nothing subprocess can do about it) to strip surrounding quotes from command line arguments
* test_marshal - recursion tests blow out stack. jython.bat sets Xss512k (and posix sets Xss1024k) but windows seems to need Xss1280k to pass
* test_netrc - file handles
* test_old_mailbox - file handles?
* test_pkgimport - file handles? but passes over here..
* test_popen - http://bugs.python.org/issue1559298
* test_shutil - apparently java.io.File.delete completely ignores ntfs permissions set by test_on_error???
* test_tarfile - mostly fixed but still flakey I guess
* test_urllib2 - ?

Also test_mailbox failures horribly and is temporarily disabled from regrtest --expected
