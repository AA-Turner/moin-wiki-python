Windows regrtest failures
=========================

1 tests failed:
    test_java_integration

* test_java_integration - jython.bat needs (or 'should' as there's absolutely nothing subprocess can do about it) to strip surrounding quotes from command line arguments

Also still problematic:

* test_mailbox - fails so horribly that it's temporarily disabled from regrtest --expected. Leaves open file handles among other things, see http://fisheye3.atlassian.com/changelog/jython?cs=6427&csize=3 for related fixes done to test_old_mailbox
* test_subprocess - test_communicate_pipe_buf http://bugs.jython.org/issue1356
