Jython uses reStructuredText and a custom writer to build its site.  This describes how to set it up.

1. Download and install [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ docutils].  Either grab it from the site and go through the normal 'python setup.py install' deal or  just run 'easy_install docutils' if you've already got [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall].

2. Grab the site builder out of svn and install it.
   {{{
   svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/trunk/sandbox/wierzbicki/jysite
   cd jysite
   python setup.py install}}}

3. Checkout the actual website code from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/trunk/website

Now you can build the site using ant.  Change into your checkout directory and run ant with no target to build the site and a .tgz file with its contents for easy uploading.  For just making changes and looking at them I run 'ant clean generate'.  The rst that comprises most of the site is in Project.
