== Sprint Topic Ideas ==

What would participants like to accomplish?  Choose from among the
ideas below or add new ones.  Register your votes below, and feel free
to comment.

Right now we have a pair of topics:

 * Dump/Restore data in the Chandler Repository as XML to allow backups and version upgrades
 * Implement a remote repository using WebDAV as the protocol layer.
 * Build a Chandler app/package

We plan to do technical introductions so that people have an idea of how things work in the Repository.
