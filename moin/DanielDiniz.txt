I'm a Biologist ('[[http://photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=289293|crawling critters]]' kind, as opposed to 'molecules' or 'plants') with a tendency to perform small Python hacks.

Current Python interests involve TrackerDevelopment and [[http://www.python.org/dev/workflow/|bug triaging]].

I have a dormant [[https://launchpad.net/ccoverage|C code coverage]] project, inspired by some flaws found by [[http://fusil.hachoir.org/|Fusil]].
