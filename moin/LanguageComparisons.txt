 * ''Several in 1997'': Guido's essay ''[http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons.html Comparing Python to Other Languages]'' is an essay comparison of Python to Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, SmallTalk, C++, CommonLisp, and Scheme.

 * ''Perl in 2000'': Eric Raymond's essay ''[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882 Why Python]'' describes how he discovered Python, how it compares to Perl, and why he was impressed.

 * ''Lisp'': Peter Norvig wrote ''[http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html Python for Lisp Programmers]'' which includes a feature-by-feature comparison.
 * ''Lisp in 1999'': There is a pretty terrible comparison of Python and Lisp (in the sense of being uninformed about Lisp) at http://www.strout.net/python/pythonvslisp.html.  The only reason for mentioning it is to say, yes, it's old and inaccurate, and not to take it too seriously (you can seach comp.lang.lisp for more specific refutations if you really want).
 * ''Tcl in 1998'': Frank Stajano's paper, ''[http://www.python.org/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/stajano/stajano.html Implementing the SMS server, or why I switched from Tcl to Python]'', was presented at the [http://www.python.org/workshops/1998-11/proceedings.html Seventh Internation Python Conference] (in 1998). (Also available in [http://www.python.org/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/stajano/stajano.pdf PDF].)
 * ''Java in 2006'': ''[http://www.razorvine.net/python/PythonComparedToJava PythonComparedToJava]'' lists the similarities and the differences between Python and Java.
 * ''Java'': Stephen Ferg's ''[http://techiesabode.com/article/read_article_w.php?article_id=13 Python & Java: a Side-by-Side Comparison]'' looks at programmer productivity.
 * ''Several in 2006'', David Howard's ''[[http://www.dmh2000.com/cjpr/ C++ vs Java vs Python vs Ruby]]''.  This essay provides implementations of moderately simple algorithms, like Red-Black Trees in various languages.  The essay compares language features and renders fair verdicts.  It has a handy feature to scroll through the various implementations side by side.  A good, quick read.
