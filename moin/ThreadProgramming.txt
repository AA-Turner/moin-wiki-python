= Stopping Threads =

I'd like to start this page off with a question.  How do you kill one thread from within another? Here's some code that shows the problem:

{{{
#!python
import threading
import time

class Worker(threading.Thread):
  def __init__(self, eventChannel, eventHandler):
    self.eventChannel = eventChannel
    self.eventHandler = eventHandler
    self.stopFlag = 0

  def shutdown(self):
    self.stopFlag = 1

  def start(self):
    self.stopFlag = 0
    while not self.stopFlag:
      event = self.eventChannel.waitEvent() # blocking call
      self.eventHandler.dispatchEvent(event)


eventChannel = EventChannel()
eventHandler = EventHandler()
worker = Worker(eventChannel, eventHandler)
worker.start()
time.sleep(20)
worker.shutdown()
}}}
The problem here is that {{{EventChannel.waitEvent()}}} is a blocking operation.  So if no event ever arrives, then our worker thread never stops.  ''({{{EventChannel}}} and {{{EventHandler}}} are classes I've invented for this example)''

== Suggestions ==

 * Make the {{{shutdown()}}} method put some harmless event on the event channel:

{{{
  def shutdown(self):
    self.stopFlag = 1
    self.eventChannel.push_event(NullEvent())
}}}

 * ''any other ideas?''

 * The example obove shows broken code. It is wrong to override {{{start()}}} and do the work there, it's the {{{run()}}} method that has to be overriden.

 * Use a Queue to pass data. Handle errors in the handler (e.g. print them to the console), keep the thread alive. 

{{{
#!python
import Queue, threading, traceback

class StopMarker:
    """This is used as an individual stopper item."""
    
class Worker(threading.Thread):
    """Get items from a queue and call the handler with the item.
    Errors in the handler are printed to stderr, the thread
    continues to run.
    An individual stop marker is used, so you can pass everyting
    as item (including None).
    """
    
    def __init__(self, handler):
        """Initialize Thread object and worker."""
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.running = 1
        self.handler = handler
        self.queue   = Queue.Queue()
        self.stopper = StopMarker()
    
    def run(self):
        """Worker loop. Errors in the handler are printed to
        stderr and the thread continues with the next item."""
        while self.running:
            try:
                item = self.queue.get()
                if item is self.stopper:
                    break
                else:
                    self.handler(item)
            except:
                traceback.print_exc()
    
    def stop(self):
        """Stop the worker thread and wait until it terminates.
        (Waits until last item is processed)"""
        self.queue.put(self.stopper)    #stopper item, then...
        self.join()                     #wait until the thread has shutdown

    def put(self, item):
        """Put an item in the queue to be processed by the handler."""
        self.queue.put(item)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    def printer(item):
        print "printer(%r)" % item
    
    w = Worker(printer)
    w.start()
    for i in range(10):
        w.put(i)
    w.stop()}}}


= Call to C function blocks all threads =

I have a C module that does database queries. Those queries go off to an SQL server
to be processed. I would like to use my query function within threads and to have it work
like {{{time.sleep()}}}, that is, block the current thread until it finishes but allow other threads to continue operation. I haven't seen this issue addressed in any of the books I have.
 
  ''This can't be handled in Python code. The author of the database module should use Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS around blocking calls to permit other threads to run. ''
