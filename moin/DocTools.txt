"doctools" is the informal name of the Python documentation toolset. New version of this toolset is better known as [[Sphinx]]. It uses DocUtils, [[reStructuredText|reStructuredText]] as markup language and builds HTML and other formats out of that.

Sphinx can be found in Mercurial repository at http://www.bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/ <<BR>>
Former doctools are located in Subversion at http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools
