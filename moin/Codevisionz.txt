= Programming Language Python =

Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and very versatile thanks to its clear syntax and simple readability. Python is freely available for the common operating systems. The usual programming paradigms such as object-oriented or functional programming are supported.

Python is already around 30 years old, but for some time now it has again occupied places in the higher ranks of the lists of the most popular programming languages on the market. And there are many good reasons for this. Python has a comprehensive standard library and numerous other libraries. Due to the large user base and because the language has existed for so long, there is a wealth of resources to fall back on. These are just a few of the reasons why Python has become indispensable in fields of application such as artificial intelligence or machine learning.
Community

The large community is another reason why you should use Python. The large and vibrant user base means that for almost all your questions there will be a forum and someone who can help you.
Programming paradigms and typing discipline

Python can be classified into multiple paradigms: object-oriented, functional, procedural, imperative. A programming paradigm is a complex of concepts, principles and abstractions which define a fundamental style of programming.

The typing discipline of a language is defined by the nature of type constraints and the way they are evaluated and enforced.
Type Strength: strong
Type Checking: dynamic
Type Safety: not safe
