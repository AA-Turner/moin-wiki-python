Fred's the guy that formats the PythonDocumentation when a Python release is needed.
Occasionally he actually fixes bugs in the docs, too.
He works at [http://www.zope.com/ Zope Corporation], where's he's worked on a
variety of cool things, including [http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zconfig/ ZConfig]
and [http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zpkgtools/ zpkg].

[["lwickjr"]]: Ack! ["Documentation/Ref/TheStandardTypeHierarchy"] was mis-posted. The original version was supposed to be ''without'' the stuff about dict_proxy objects, with the first revision adding this information. <SIGH> Also, I goofed on some of the markup, and don't fully understand some constructs, so it doesn't look quite right. In particular, items containing word::definition markup do not work indented, as is required for this page. Feel free to fix the markup!

You probably already know that I've also posted a WikiMarkup version of ["Documentation/Ref/FrontMatter"]; this one seemed to work fine on the first try.

Comments, please?

[FredDrake]: Appearantly, I've lost mental context on this.  Please explain what you want me to comment on, any why you want this context in the wiki?  I'm sure I knew at one point, but seem to have lost my mental swap space...
