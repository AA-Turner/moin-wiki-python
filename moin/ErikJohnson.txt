## A quick note to anyone creating a homepage:

## Please only do so if you're providing or promoting Python-related
## content or if you have signed your name on another page (and want
## others to be able to contact you). Pages which are not referenced
## by other pages or which do not provide significant new content will
## be deleted.

Email: Spam is largely out of control on the internet. Sometimes I check
email at HedgesFan at G mail dot com. If you want my regular email address
that is checked almost daily, ask me for it.
