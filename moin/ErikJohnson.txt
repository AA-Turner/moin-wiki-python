that is checked almost daily, ask me for it.

I am currently doing a course on Coursera titled [[https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython1-003 | An introduction to Interactive Programming In Python]]. (The link is to the actual instance of the class I am in - you may need to go in through the Coursera front page and search class listings to get to the next offering of the class.)

I don't really expect to learn a lot about the Python language itself, but some neat things are starting to happen with programming languages in general. In this case, they are using a [[http://www.codeskulptor.org/ | wholly in-browser environment]] to run Python. It's not quite the same Python, but almost (one shortcoming I noticed is iteritems() on dict is missing.) This is based on http://www.skulpt.org/
