We may do a supplementary print run for 2009 PyCon T-shirts.  It will have to be a different process (one-off, via CafePress or similar) because the set-up cost of an other full print run is prohibitive.


Want a Shirt

Everyone who helped with PyCon 2009 and did not receive a T-shirt (or want an extra), please add your name, email, and shirt size below.
