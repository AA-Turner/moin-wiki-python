Are you attending `PyCon 2009 <http://us.pycon.org/2009>`_ and
want to split a room at the Crowne Plaza hotel (or elsewhere) with other attendees?
List yourself below, along with:

* how many other people you want to share with,
* what nights you'll be there,
* any other requirements (e.g. male/female, smoking/non).


I Already Have a Room Reservation
=================================

If you have a room reservation and
you're looking for a roommate to share costs, list your info here:

* Mar 26-31 Crowne Plaza, looking for 1 roommate, non-smoking. Contact Jason (jaraco@jaraco.com)

**Note:** Be sure to list the names of your roommates on the reservation
as having permission to check in, so they can get a key to your shared
room from the front desk (by showing photo ID).

I'm Looking For A Room
======================

If you're looking to share a room (but you haven't
made a reservation yet), list your info here:


* Dj Gilcrease (digitalxero@gmail.com) I will be attending Mar 5th to Mar 28th, I am not picky about accommodations as long as it does not cost me more then $100 for all 3 nights (I am a college student on a tight budget)
* Gustavo Barbieri (barbieri@gmail.com) I'll attend the conference and possibly the sprints, but not tutorials. I'm fine sharing rooms with any number of people. Being at Brazil makes my budget automatically very low.
