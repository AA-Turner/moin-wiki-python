Um, I don't know if I should have put my own page up here or not.  It is a convenient place to put my python code, I guess, so I'll probably be doing that in the near future.

== Notes ==

["JAM"]: I think that the idea of Python "one-liners" is a good example of how to process multiple commands in the same line.  Although this is the same as adding new lines.  It is something that takes a little more creativity however, so I am neutral on this subject.
