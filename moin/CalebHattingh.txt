Um, I don't know if I should have put my own page up here or not.  It is a convenient place to put my python code, I guess, so I'll probably be doing that in the near future.

= Update: 11 October 2006 =

Haha.  It's been "years" since I wrote the above, still no code posted; that's a shame.  Well, nobody's been bugging me to remove this page, or something, so I guess I'll leave it until either that happens or I get around to putting some stuff up here.

== Notes ==

[[JAM]]: I think that the idea of Python "one-liners" is a good example of how to process multiple commands in the same line.  Although this is the same as adding new lines.  It is something that takes a little more creativity however, so I am neutral on this subject.
