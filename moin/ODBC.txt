= ODBC =

ODBC stands for ''Open Database Connectivity'', the industry standard for database C APIs.

Most databases ships with ODBC drivers, so chances are high that you can use one of these drivers together with a Python ODBC interface to connect your Python application with any database on the market.

mxODBC Connect is a commercial client-server product that allows connecting Python to ODBC compatible databases running on remote servers without requiring an ODBC driver on the client side. The product uses mxODBC on the server side and provides a highly portable Python library for the client side. As such it supports all database backend that mxODBC supports, but allows connecting to these from many different Python-supported platforms.
