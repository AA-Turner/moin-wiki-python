At PyCon 2009, Steve Holden suggested building a site
for people who wish to learn Python.

We already have BeginnersGuide, but it's buried in the wiki and is pretty dense text.  

== Possible names ==

Vote here:

 * Python 101 [+1 sdeibel -1 mfoord] (there is already a python101.com plus 101 means nothing to people outside the USA)
 * Starting Python [+1 mfoord]
 * Python from zero []
 * Python from scratch []
 * Python for beginners []

We should probably avoid 'Learning Python', since that's 
an O'Reilly book title. Likewise there is a book called 'Beginning Python'.

Should it target Python 2, 3 or both? Python 3 would be better, but would mean that initially it couldn't cover common third party libraries that haven't yet been ported to Python 3.

== Content ==

The site would primarily link to resources, so its page architecture would mostly be pretty shallow.

 * What's Python? -- like [[BeginnersGuide/Overview]].
 * Starting Points -- documentation, tutorials, downloads
 * Tools -- links to IDEs, distributions, (hosting services?)
 * Libraries -- PyPI; commonly-used libraries
 * Books -- list of introductory books
 * Videos -- link to relevant introductory tutorials
 * The Community -- user groups, conferences

How about commissioning prominent authors to produce an article each on a range of subjects?

== Maintenance ==

The pydotorg volunteers are stretched thinly enough that we should try to make this low-maintenance.  

Can we make RSS feeds available by processing particular pages from the Python wiki, and then derive most of the new site's content from them?
