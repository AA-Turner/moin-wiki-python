At PyCon 2009, Steve Holden suggested building a site
for people who wish to learn Python.

We already have BeginnersGuide, but it's buried in the wiki and is pretty dense text.  

== Possible names ==

 * Python 101
 * Starting Python
 * PythonFromZero

We should probably avoid 'Learning Python', since that's 
an O'Reilly book title.

== Content ==

The site would primarily link to resources, so its page architecture would mostly be pretty shallow.

 * What's Python? -- like [[BeginnersGuide/Overview]].
 * Starting Points -- documentation, tutorials, downloads
 * Tools -- links to IDEs, distributions, (hosting services?)
 * Libraries -- PyPI; commonly-used libraries
 * Books -- list of introductory books
 * Videos -- link to relevant introductory tutorials
 * The Community -- user groups, conferences
