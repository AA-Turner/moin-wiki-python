This page turned up when I was trying to find out how to make a suggestion to update PyPI with current Pyjamas info. 
The Pyjamas links are dead, and should be replaced with:

Python 2.6 Install Instructions -- Vista:
The instructions to install Python 2.6 on Vista suggest using runas.  The problem is that I have no idea what Administrator password either Sony or Microsoft set by default.  I find it much easier to right click on a Command Prompt icon (can get through start menu search) and select "Run as Administrator."  Then, everything I do from that command prompt has Administrator priviledges.  I imagine other Vista users have a similar situation.
