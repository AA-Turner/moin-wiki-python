The PythonCd was made with contributions of very many people:
 * [[http://python.org/|Python.org]] (Python)
 * [[http://debian.org/|the Debian Project]] (tons of Debian GNU/Linux software packages)
 * [[http://knoppix.de/|KNOPPIX]] (bootable Linux CD we used for deriving this)
 * many brave documentation writers, see PythonDocs
 * LinuxWiki:ThomasWaldmann (obviously I was the one first starting the concrete work on a CD)
 * ... (please put yourself onto the list if you contribute)
