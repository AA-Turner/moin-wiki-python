The PythonCd was made with contributions of very many people:
 * [http://python.org/ Python.org] (Python)
 * [http://debian.org/ the Debian Project] (tons of Debian GNU/Linux software packages)
 * [http://knoppix.de/ KNOPPIX] (bootable Linux CD we used for deriving this)
 * many brave documentation writers, see PythonDocs
 * LinuxWiki:Thomas Waldmann (obviously I was the one first starting the concrete work on a CD)
 * ... (please put yourself onto the list if you contribute)
