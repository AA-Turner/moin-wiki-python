= PSF Python Job Board =

The Python job board was run by single volunteers for many years. Since the job board activities have significantly increased in recent years, and the last Chris Withers, who ran the board in the years 2010-2014, left the project, the PSF would like to relaunch the project using a team of volunteers.

At the same time, we'd like to move the job board from the legacy site to the new relaunched www.python.org Django based site.

== Project Mailing List ==

The project is run using a mailing list dedicated for the team:

 * [[https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/jobs|Python Jobs Mailing List]]

The list gets all email sent to jobs@python.org. The old process used this email address for job submissions. The new process will use a web form based approach instead.

If you want to help in the job board team, please write to jobs@python.org.

== Resources ==

 * [[http://www.python.org/jobs/|New job board]]

 This will be the new location of the Python job board, run using Django and backed by a database.

 '''Note: At the moment this still redirects to the legacy website.'''

 * [[http://www.python.org/community/jobs/|Job board listing ported from the legacy site]]

 This is a single page which has to be manually maintained via the Django admin interface.

 * [[http://legacy.python.org/community/jobs/|Legacy job board site]]

 This page was manually maintained through the Subversion repository which runs the legacy website.
