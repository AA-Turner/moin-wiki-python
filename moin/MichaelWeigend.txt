I live in Witten, a city in the eastern part of the Ruhrgebiet. This is an industrial and cultural area in the west of Germany, somewhere between Cologne (big gothic cathedral) and MÃ¼nster (Westfalian Peace, end of 30-Years-War 1648).

I teach informatics and chemistry at a highschool in Witten and didacticts of computer science at the University of Hagen.
