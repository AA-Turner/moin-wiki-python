== Use with statement to manage locks ==
Starting in Python 2.5, the `with` statement is a far easier way to manage locks:

{{{#!python
some_lock = threading.Lock()

with some_lock:
    do_stuff_requiring_lock()
}}}

This is equivalent to:

{{{#!python
some_lock = threading.Lock()

some_lock.acquire():
try:
    do_stuff_requiring_lock()
finally:
    some_lock.release()
}}}
