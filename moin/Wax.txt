= Wax Gui Toolkit =

Wax is a GUI toolkit. It sits on top of wxPython, removing some of the low-level aspects of that GUI, and adding some useful abstractions.

The goal is that Wax should be easier to use than WxPython, to be more "Pythonic". It's far from feature complete but very nice for quick hacks.
