This work in progress is developped to gather and write an article, to be published for example in PythonPapers, to promote and advertise the EuroPython conference.

The editor of [http://pythonpapers.org The Python Papers] wrote recently to the EuroPython mailing list:

= Context =

I am the editor-in-chief of The Python Papers (http://pythonpapers.org), a Python magazine created by a noncommercial group of enthusiasts. I am currently contacting various conference organisers about the possibilities of collaboration. Our next edition is due out in May, which is a little before EuroPython 2007 is scheduled for.

I thought you might like to contribute an article covering the event to let people know more about it. It would also be good to include any information about last years' event, some selected photos etc.

Additionally, in our next edition we will be including a review of python papers and articles published in the last year. Where we have access to conference proceedings, we will try to select a few articles for inclusion in this effort. Going forward, it would be great to have people nominate and vote for favourite articles. I was unable to find the proceedings of EuroPython 2006. Would it be possible to have access to this?

The PyCon committee has also graciously sponsored some bag inserts advertising the Python Papers to attendees. Would something similar be possible for EuroPython 2007?

It might be interesting to take a look at the photos on Flickr and contact the photographers whose photos you like to ask for their permission to use them:

Assuming you're successful, some of these photos should complement quite nicely what Nicolas is proposing to write.

The CERN conference site is available for anyone to access:

http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=44

The timetable and speaker list pages available from that page are
particularly useful.

HorstJens, author of several pictures on flickr about EuroPython2006 answered positively about their use.
