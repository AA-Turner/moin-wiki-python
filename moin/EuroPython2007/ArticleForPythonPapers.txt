See ["EuroPython2007"] for the attendee conference Wiki.

This work in progress is developed to gather and write an article, to be published for example in PythonPapers, to promote and advertise the EuroPython conference.

== Article Draft ==

Now in its sixth year, EuroPython - known more formally as the European Python and Zope conference - moves on once again, as is the EuroPython tradition of helping European Python users and others to inadvertently explore the European continent, descending upon Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania, and calling it home from Monday 9th July until Wednesday 11th July. Although the programme for this year's conference has yet to be finalised, reports and materials from last year's highly successful event may be persuasive for those considering making EuroPython 2007 part of their schedule.

EuroPython 2006 was held at one of Europe's most significant scientific sites: CERN (the European laboratory for particle physics research) in Geneva, Switzerland. With superb facilities and a rich programme of highly informative, entertaining and inspiring talks, along with an unparalleled backdrop of seriously big (and historic) scientific hardware, the conference proved to be as memorable as those which preceded it.
