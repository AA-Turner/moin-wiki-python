Bazaar Sprint

 * Where: Vilnius, Lithuania
 * When: after EuroPython, 12-14 july

Bazaar (formerly known as Bazaar-NG) is a distributed version control system
that aids open source development and reduces barriers to participation. 
We're currently on a performance drive, a lot of the preparation work has been
done at the last sprint in London, http://bazaar-vcs.org/SprintLondonMay07
You don't have to already be familiar with the code to help make a difference.
