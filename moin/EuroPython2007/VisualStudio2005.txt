= Visual Studio 2005 Sprint =
=== This is a sprint suggestion to work on making Visual Studio 2005 a fully supported build platform for python 2.5 and 2.6 ===

 * Where: Vilnius, Lithuania
 * When: after EuroPython, 12-14 july
 * Organizer: Kristján Valur Jónsson <kristjan@ccpgames.com>

Visual Studio 2005 has been availible for more than two years but still it is not an officially supported compiler for python.  The benefits of using it are:
 * greater performance, particularly through profiler guided optimization
 * cross compilation for amd64 platform. 

Although the PCBuild8 subdirectory is availible in the release25-maint branch and the trunk, a few things need to be done to make it complete:
 * Fixup dependency on externals for some modules (bz2 etc), particularly for amd64
 * Polish automatic PGO builds
 * Fix and polish install script generation, and CRT redistribution
 * Work on setting up a buildbot
 
Please contact me at <kristjan@ccpgames.com> if you think this is a worthwhile project and want to participate.
