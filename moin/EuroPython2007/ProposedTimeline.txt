= EuroPython 2007 Proposed Timeline =

From the [http://www.europython.org/ conference Web site] for 2006 (before it gets overwritten), plus observed administrative milestones:

||<tablestyle="width: 100%" style="background-color: #EEEEEE; width: 20%"> 17th March ||<style="width: 80%"> ''[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-March/005652.html Web site goes live]'' [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-March/005673.html (first sign of interest for registering/booking)] ||
||<#DDDDDD> 3rd April || [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-April/005715.html Call for proposals (talks)] ||
||<#DDDDDD> 27th April || [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-April/005755.html Keynote speakers announced] ||
||<#EEEEEE> 15th May || Paper acceptance notifications ||
||<#EEEEEE> 17th May || Registration opens ||
||<#EEEEEE> 26th May || Early bird registration closes ||
||<#EEEEEE> 31st May || Deadline for talk summaries (proposals) ||
||<#DDDDDD> 4th June || Talk schedule announced ||
||<#DDDDDD> 11th June || Normal bird registration closes ||
||<#DDDDDD> 24th June || Paper submission deadline ||
||<#DDDDDD> 26th June || Online registration closes ||
||<#EEEEEE> 30th June-2nd July || Pre-conference sprints ||
||<#EEEEEE> 3rd July-5th July || EuroPython conference ||
||<#EEEEEE> 4th July || Conference dinner ||
||<#EEEEEE> 6th July || CERN visit ||
||<#EEEEEE> 6th July-9th July || Post-conference sprints ||

This is a big contrast to the original [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-January/005555.html IRC meeting]-agreed timeline which was optimistically decided upon well in advance of the 2006 conference:

||<tablestyle="width: 100%" style="background-color: #DDDDDD; width: 20%"> 15th February ||<style="width: 80%"> Call for Proposals ||
||<#EEEEEE> March || Opening online Registration (Payment issue pending!) ||
||<#EEEEEE> 31st March || Deadline for proposal submissions ||
||<#DDDDDD> 30th April || Prelininary Program with accepted talks ||
||<#EEEEEE> 19th May || Closing Early Bird registration ||
||<#EEEEEE> 3rd July-5th July || EuroPython conference ||

Given the [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2006-May/005764.html panic] in May 2006 about the conference status, it might be best to not let the timeline slip much later than that of 2006.

== Comparisons ==

It's always fun to compare things! Comparing the above with [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/EventCalendar PyCon 2007]:

||<tablestyle="width: 100%" style="width: 20%"> ||<#DDDDDD> '''EuroPython 2006''' ||<#EEEEEE> '''PyCon 2007''' ||
||<#DDDDDD> Registration period prior to conference (duration) || 47 days (40 days) || 70 days (63 days) ||
||<#EEEEEE> Talk submission start, deadline and acceptance prior to conference (duration of submission period) || 91 days, 33 days, 29 days (58 days) || 161 days, 115 days, 100 days (46 days) ||
