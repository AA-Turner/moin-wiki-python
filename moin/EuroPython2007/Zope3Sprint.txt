Zope 3 Sprint

 * Where: Vilnius, Lithuania
 * When: after EuroPython, 12-14 July
 * Organizer: Marius Gedminas <marius@pov.lt>

I have long planned to add coloured output to the Zope 3 test runner.  (The old SchoolTool test runner had it, and I can attest that it helps greatly to identify the key parts of test failures in the long test output).  If there's time left, I might look at some other small tasks to make the Zope 3 developer's life more pleasant.  (The Zope 3 developer in question is, of course, Yours Truly ;-).

If you intend to participate, please put your name here:
