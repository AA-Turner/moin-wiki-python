I am a student of JeffreyElkner and a Linux (and Python) enthusiast.
I've been interested in programming since I was exposed to LOGO in 2nd grade. Python is my favorite language because the syntax doesn't get in the way. It's also very to read.

I'm currently working on GASP(Graphical API for Students of Python)
