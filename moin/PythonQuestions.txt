==== Win 95 Installation ====

'''Q.''' I run a Windows 95 200 MHz Compaq computer, when I tried to install Python 2.0, the installation program consistently crashes/freezes at 52% of the process. Can you give me any suggestions?

'''A.''' Make sure you have enough disk space.  Accept the default choices the installer suggests.  Make sure all other programs are killed first, especially virus scanners (use Ctrl+Alt+Del repeatedly to kill off everything except Explorer and Systray).  Try a more recent version of Python (like 2.2.1), which uses better installer technology.  Try an ActiveState installer, which uses completely different installer technology.  Try the minimalist PythonWare installer, which seems to amount to an automated unzip.  Accept that Microsoft no longer supports Win95 and plan to get another OS.

==== pyexpat Module ====

'''Q.''' I just downloaded version 2.0. When I try to run the test_sax.py module it complains that it can't find the driver pyexpat.py. I looked in the distribution and it doesn't seem to be there? I'm running on Solaris 2.7. Thank You.

'''A.''' The pyexpat module is a compiled extension module.  See the comments in the Modules/Setup file for
instructions on getting and building the required C library.  Once you've built that, enable the module in the
Modules/Setup file and type "make" in the top level of the Python source tree.  "make --install" will re-install
Python for you, or you can copy Modules/pyexpat.so to $exec_prefix/lib/python2.0/lib-dynload/ if you're building
modules as shared objects.

==== Documentation in Windows Helpfile Format ====

'''Q.''' Where do I get the documentation for Python in the CHM (Compiled HTML) format?

'''A.''' See http://www.orgmf.com.ar/condor/pytstuff.html.

'''A.''' Since version 2.3 included in Windows distribution.

==== Windows XP look-and-feel ====

'''Q.''' How can I make ["WxPython"] on Windows XP assume XP look-and-feel?

'''A.''' Put two files '''python.exe.manifest''' and '''pythonw.exe.manifest''', both with the following contents:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
<assemblyIdentity version="1.0.0.0" processorArchitecture="X86" name="*.*.*" type="win32" />
<description>*</description>
<dependency>
<dependentAssembly>
<assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
 version="6.0.0.0" processorArchitecture="X86" publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df" language="*" />
</dependentAssembly>
</dependency>
</assembly>
}}}

in your Python installation directory (where respective '''.exe''' files reside). Next time you run
your wxPython applications, they'll look like "normal" XP applications.

This may also affect other Python modules that use Windows display API.

 Follow-up (a ''very'' late one): With Python 2.2.2 it caused all windowed applications (TkInter too) to crash on window close on my machine. Applications are not required (just allowed) to support the new DLL's for the XP fancy look.

 If you run into this problem and deleting manifests doesn't help, try un- and reinstalling Python.
