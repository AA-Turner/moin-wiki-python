= What We Are Going To Do =

Guido has requested that the AST branch please be finished for Python 2.5 .  Sprint on the AST branch has also become a tradition since the first sprint at PyCon 2003.  Here is a rough list of what needs to be worked on:

* applying patches from SF

* Get generator expression working

* Get decorators working

* Work out bugs (including memory leaks)

* Flesh out docs on AST


= Preparing =

To get ready for the sprint, get a CVS checkout of the 'ast-branch'.  How to do get a tagged branch, see the Python Dev FAQ @ http://www.python.org/dev/devfaq.html .

Once you have a checkout, read Python/compile.txt .  That gives an overview of what files are involved and how the basic process works.


= Attendees =

* Brett Cannon

* Neal Norwitz (maybe)

* LD Landis

* John Ehresman (arriving early afternoon on Saturday)

Q: Is a pythonite with very little hacking-CPython experience of any use? -- Timothy Fitz

A: Sure!  Part of the point of the sprints is to teach people about what is being sprinted on in hopes of them continuing to contribute long after the sprint is over.  I just can't make any guarantees about entertainment value.  =)  -- Brett C.
