= What We Are Going To Do =

Guido has requested that the AST branch please be finished for Python 2.5 .  Sprint on the AST branch has also become a tradition since the first sprint at PyCon 2003.  Here is a rough list of what needs to be worked on:

* applying patches from SF

* Get generator expression working

* Get decorators working

* Work out bugs (including memory leaks)

* Flesh out docs on AST


= Attendees =

* Brett Cannon

* Neal Norwitz (maybe)
