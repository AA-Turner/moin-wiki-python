Occasionally the Wiki is hit by spammers trying to increase Google's ranking for their sites by 
adding links to them.  These spammers may replace a page's content with dozens of links, 
or they may insert links into the existing text.

= Fixing the changes =

To fix changes, follow the little 'i' icon at the top of the page. 
You'll find a history of all versions and a
revert button for each of them. Usually you can just revert to the
previous version.

= Preventing future attacks =

Edit the LocalBadContent page.  This page records a bunch of regex patterns that are applied
to all of the links in a page; if a matching link is found when the page content is saved, 
the save will be disallowed and an error will be reported.

Remember that this page lists regular expressions, not strings, so the '.' character will match
any character.  If you're matching a domain such as foo.com, add `foo\.com` to the page.
