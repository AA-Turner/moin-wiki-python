By oversight, the name of the society has been wrongly represented as 'The Indian Python Software Society' in one of the documents submitted by us and and the registration certificate. Due to this error we have been unable to open a bank account.

Resolved that 

The Registrar of societies Ootacamund be requested to rectify the mistake and issue a fresh certificate of registration with the name of the society as 'Indian Python Software Society'
