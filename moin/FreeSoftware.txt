As defined by the [[http://www.fsf.org/|Free Software Foundation]], software is [[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html|free software]] if it gives its users these freedoms:

 * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
 * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
 * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Note that this has nothing to do with whether software can be obtained [[ZeroPrice|for nothing or at no cost]]. A [[FreeSoftware|Free Software]] program (just like a non-free program) might be distributed to different people or at different times for various different prices, including [[ZeroPrice|a price of zero]]. A program is [[FreeSoftware|Free Software]] if its users have the freedoms listed above, regardless of what monetary price was paid.

Software distributed under the Python License (including Python itself) is [[FreeSoftware|Free Software]] and is often distributed [[ZeroPrice|at no cost]].
