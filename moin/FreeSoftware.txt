As defined by the [http://www.fsf.org/ Free Software Foundation], software is [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html free software] if it gives its users these freedoms:

 * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
 * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
 * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Note that this has nothing to do with whether software can be obtained for ZeroPrice. A FreeSoftware program (just like a non-free program) might be distributed to different people or at different times for various different prices, including ZeroPrice. A program is FreeSoftware if its users have the freedoms listed above, regardless of what monetary price was paid.

Software distributed under the PythonLicense (including Python itself) is FreeSoftware and is often distributed for ZeroPrice.
