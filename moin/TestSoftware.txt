== Software ==

 * UnitTest in the standard library (http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-unittest.html)
 * PyUnit at http://pyunit.sourceforge.net
 * [http://www.garethrees.org/2001/12/04/python-coverage/ StatementCoverage]  This module runs your code, then produces a report on how many statements were executed, and which ones were not.  Use it to ensure your unit tests test everything.

What I need is a layered test system like
 * test suit
   * with fast/normal/detailed mode
   * with known failing tests excluded
 * test package to group related tests with preset parameters
 * individual test
   * with options like log details
   * with ability to flex parameters, extend options etc.
 * test utilities
   * fuzzy difference
   * different logging/reporting/visualization helpers
   * with output capture capability
