GnuEmacs is the editor of the gods (XEmacs even more so - it ships with PythonMode as a default). Does everything (almost) that you could want it to, and if it doesn't you can make it do what you want, in Python (or Lisp).

Some tools have been written for using Python from Emacs:
  * PythonMode, a major mode for programming Python in Emacs. 
  * [http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs/pymacs.tar.gz Pymacs(download)], an extension for allowing Emacs users to extend Emacs using Python, where they might have traditionally used Emacs LISP. '
  * [http://www.zipworld.com.au/~peterm Emacs Language Sensitive Editor (ELSE)], an template-based minor mode for Emacs, with templates for Python.
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/oo-browser/ OO-Browser], an Emacs class browser for object-oriented languages with support for Python.
  * The [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/emacspeak emacspeak audio desktop] is a speech interface that allows visually impaired users to interact independently and efficiently with the computer. It has editing support for interactive Python development. Features aural highlighting, structured browsing and debugging.
