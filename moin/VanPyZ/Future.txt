 * Jamu Kakar: [[https://storm.canonical.com/|Storm]]
   * Henry: I'd like to know more about the internals of ORMs. How do they build their queries? How do they determine which join is needed? How do they maintain consistency among objects?
   * Jamu: I think a talk about how to use Storm with a focus on some common patterns to common problems would be more widely interesting, but I can also talk about internals.  I haven't actually prepared a talk yet, but I'd expect it to be in the 30-45 minute range (I'm not a fan of very long talks).  I can prepare the talk for Dec or Jan.
 * Henry Precheur: [[http://wsgi.org/wsgi/|WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)]]: WSGI powers all modern Python web frameworks. It provides a unified way to talk HTTP. (Talk can be 30 mins to 1h30 long.)
 * Dethe Elza [[http://www.reportlab.org/|ReportLab]]
