 * Jamu Kakar: [[https://storm.canonical.com/|Storm]]
   * Henry: I'd like to know more about the internals of ORMs. How do they build their queries? How do they determine which join is needed? How do they maintain consistency among objects?
   * Jamu: I think a talk about how to use Storm with a focus on some common patterns to common problems would be more widely interesting, but I can also talk about internals.  I haven't actually prepared a talk yet, but I'd expect it to be in the 30-45 minute range (I'm not a fan of very long talks).  I can prepare the talk for Dec or Jan.

 * Henry Precheur:
   * [[http://wsgi.org/wsgi/|WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)]]: WSGI powers all modern Python web frameworks. It provides a unified way to talk HTTP. (Talk can be 30 mins to 1h30 long.)
   * [[http://www.sqlalchemy.org/|SQLAchemy]]: The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python.

 * Dethe Elza [[http://www.reportlab.org/|ReportLab]]

 * Doug Latornell:
   * I can do a session (probably about 30 minutes) on an image display desktop app I wrote. I would talk about [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML|PyYAML]], the [[http://stuvel.eu/projects/flickrapi|Python API for Flickr]], and maybe a bit about TkInter, using the app as a concrete example. I could do this pretty much any time with a week or 2 notice.
   * I've been looking at [[http://couchdb.apache.org/|CouchDB]] for a potential project at work. I haven't delved too deeply yet, but if the project gets the go-ahead, I should be able to talk about CouchDB in, say, January, or February.  This one would likely be about 30 minutes too, but it depends how much I know when I do it, and how many questions people have.
