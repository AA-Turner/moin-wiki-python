= Python 2.2.4 =

Python 2.2.4 is another maintenance release in the Python 2.2.x line.
This release will extend Python 2.2.3 with various bugfixes, with an
emphasis on bugs that can cause core dumps ("General Protection Faults"
and the like on some systems) and memory leaks.

Some additional low-risk fixes may be included if time allows and
changes are not needed to backport the fixes.

No features will be added.

The release should occur late in 2003.  There may be a single beta or
release candidate, with the final release coming one to two weeks after.
