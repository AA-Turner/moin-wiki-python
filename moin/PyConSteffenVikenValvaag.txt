This page contains information about the talk I gave on March 28, 2003 at PyCon.  The subject of the talk was [http://poshmodule.sf.net/ POSH], which is an open source project hosted at [http://sf.net SourceForge.net].  The paper on POSH that was submitted for PyCon is available [http://www.cs.uit.no/~steffenv/posh here] in HTML and PDF formats.  I will add a link to my Power``Point slides shortly.
