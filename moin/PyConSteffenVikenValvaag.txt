This page contains information about the talk I gave on March 28, 2003 at PyCon.  The subject of the talk was [[http://poshmodule.sf.net/|POSH]], which is an open source project hosted at [[http://sf.net|SourceForge.net]].  The paper on POSH that was submitted for PyCon is available in [[http://poshmodule.sf.net/posh/html/index.html|HTML]] and [[http://poshmodule.sf.net/posh/posh.pdf|PDF]] formats.  The Power``Point slides I used are available [[http://poshmodule.sf.net/PyConSlides.ppt|here]].
