This page contains information about the talk I gave on March 28, 2003 at PyCon.  The subject of the talk was [http://poshmodule.sf.net/ POSH], which is an open source project hosted at [http://sf.net SourceForge.net].  The paper on POSH that was submitted for PyCon is available in [http://poshmodule.sf.net/posh/html/index.html HTML] and [http://poshmodule.sf.net/posh/posh.pdf PDF] formats.  The Power``Point slides I used are available [http://poshmodule.sf.net/PyConSlides.ppt here].
