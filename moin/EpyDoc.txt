[[http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/|EpyDoc]] is a documentation generator for Python similar to JavaDoc.  It provides its own simple text-markup language, but also supports the use of ReStructuredText.  It does not support Zope "scarecrow"-style interfaces.

Development of [[http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/|EpyDoc]] is hosted on SourceForge.
