[http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/ EpyDoc] is a documentation generator for Python similar to JavaDoc.  It provides it's own simple text-markup language, but also supports the use of ReStructuredText.  It does not support Zope "scarecrow"-style interfaces.

Development of [http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/ EpyDoc] is hosted on SourceForge.
