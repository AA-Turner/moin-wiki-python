'''Why did you choose Python?'''

Developers and their companies are using Python to do all kinds of tasks. From utilities to ERP systems. Why are they choosing Python over Java, C++ and other proven enterprise 3 and 4gls?

At this meeting we'll all get a chance to meet each other, learn why we've made this choice and what we've learned in the process.

To kick off the meeting, I have asked George Lambert of Goldenware Travel to explain why his company has switched to Python and the benefits and challenges they are seeing.
