The basic idea behind StructuredText is to avoid the necessity for a markup
language like TeX, Troff or HTML/SGML/XML and being able to create richly
structured documents without thinking about the markup. The StructuredText
markup language is intiutive, minimal and unobtrusive.
 
There are several different versions of StructuredText:

  * ClassicStructuredText
  * [http://dev.zope.org/Members/jim/StructuredTextWiki/StructuredTextNG StructuredTextNG]
  * [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext/ Setext]
  * ReStructuredText - intended primarily for documentation
  * PyTextile - intended for web use

One application of StructuredText which is currently discussed on the DocSig
is the generation of documentation from Python DocStrings.

See Wiki:TextFilter for more information on text filters, like
!StructuredText.  We have a bit of information about !StructuredText
[wiki:StructuredText/MarkUp mark up].
