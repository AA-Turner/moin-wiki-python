The basic idea behind StructuredText is to avoid the necessity for a markup
language like TeX, Troff or HTML/SGML/XML and being able to create richly 
structured documents without thinking about the markup. The StructuredText 
markup language is intiutive, minimal and unobtrusive.
 
There are several different versions of StructuredText:

  * ClassicStructuredText
  * [http://dev.zope.org/Members/jim/StructuredTextWiki/StructuredTextNG StructuredTextNG]
  * [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext/ Setext]
  * ReStructuredText
  * PyTextile

One application of StructuredText which is currently discussed on the DocSig
is the generation of documentation from Python DocStrings.
