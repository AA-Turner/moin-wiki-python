[http://www.gnupg.org GNU Privacy Guard] is a GPLed implementation of the PGP encryption protocols.   Also known as "GnuPG" or "GPG".

= Python/GnuPG interface =
The original [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/gpg Python/GnuPG interface] is no longer actively maintained by amk.  Please record comments, recipes, and patches on this Wiki page.
If anyone wants to maintain the module and needs a CVS repository to store the code, just ask for write permission to the [http://www.sf.net/projects/pycrypto/ pycrypto project on SourceForge].

= News Flash! =
I've added a great deal to amk's GPG.py, building on Richard Jones' 1.3 update and adding more support for the decryption, signing, key management, bells, whistles, and so on which amk's original design implied.  This is still a pure-python implementation, and requires nothing that is not in Python 2.2.1 or later, other than the gpg executable itself.  This is *not* a drop-in replacement; I needed to make some interface changes to support decryption and to better abstract the internals of returned objects -- it might want to be called GPG2.py (or maybe something like GPGng.py to prevent confusion with anything related to gnupg version 2 -- ideas welcome, as well as opinions on whether the name needs to be changed in the first place).  

I don't know yet where the new module's permanent home is going to be, but as of this writing (July 2005) you can find it in the [http://trac.t7a.org/isconf ISconf] SVN Repository at 
http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/file/trunk/lib/python/isconf/GPG.py.  The right thing for me (or someone) to do going forward will be to confirm the license with amk and/or re-publish under the GPL, and post it somewhere more permanent.  If you do any of this before I get to it, then please update this page.  -- SteveTraugott

= openpgp =

Another worthy successor might be the [http://aonalu.makahavalley.org/openpgp/python Python opengpg] which also uses the [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html Python Crypto Toolkit].

= cryptlib =

[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ cryptlib] also offers access to [http://www.openpgp.org/ OpenPGP]  methods. It has a python-interface, but it's not natural at all.
