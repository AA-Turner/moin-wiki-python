= Python/GnuPG interface =
A [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/gpg Python/GnuPG interface] exists, but is no longer actively maintained.  Please record comments, recipes, and patches on this Wiki page.
If anyone wants to maintain the module and needs a CVS repository to store the code, just ask for write permission to the [http://www.sf.net/projects/pycrypto/ pycrypto project on SourceForge].
 * A worthy successor might be the [http://aonalu.makahavalley.org/openpgp/python Python opengpg] which also uses the [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html Python Crypto Toolkit].

= cryptlib =
[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ cryptlib] also offers access to [http://www.openpgp.org/ OpenPGP]  methods. It has a python-interface, but it's not natural at all.
