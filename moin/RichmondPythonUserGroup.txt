=== PyRVA ===

PyRVA is the new Richmond Python User Group founded on 1 September 2015. At the moment, we are using [[http://meetup.com/PyRVA-Meetup/|Meetup.com]], but are in the process of developing [[http://www.pyrva.org|PyRVA.org]].

== Meetups ==

We hope to schedule one or more small meetups in Fall 2015, but are targeting Winter 2016 for our full events. Our event ideas include talks, hackathons and workshops.

Check back for details about our first event.
