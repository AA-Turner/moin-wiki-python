= PyRVA =

PyRVA is the new Richmond Python User Group founded on 1 September 2015. At the moment, we are using [[http://meetup.com/PyRVA-Meetup/|Meetup.com]], but are in the process of developing [[http://www.pyrva.org|PyRVA.org]].

== Meetups ==

We hope to schedule one or more small meetups in Fall 2015, but are targeting Winter 2016 for our full events. Our event ideas include talks, hackathons and workshops.
