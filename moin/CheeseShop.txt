CheeseShop is a secret code name for '''Python Package Index''' also known as PyPI and accessible from http://pypi.python.org/

PyPI is not the only catalog of Python packages - see PyPiImplementations for alternatives.

PyPI is still supported and developed to some degree - you may help, though. CheeseShopDev contains all necessary information about PyPI to jump in.
