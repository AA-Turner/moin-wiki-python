== Trivia ==


The secret code name refers to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch|Cheese Shop sketch]] performed and recorded by John Cleese and Micheal Palin on 7 January 1972.


If you are really curious then view the sketch on [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0|YouTube]].


Whether that name was chosen because CPAN contains so many packages at that time remains in the dark zone of rumours and wild speculation.
