= Create a server that tests uploaded packages on PyPI. =

== Work to be done ==

The work is separated into three steps:

 1. a solution capable of running scripts when an event occurs (a new release of project X is available on PyPI)
 2. a Continuous integration server able to run the testsuite for those distributions
 3. a quality mesurement tool, able to provide feedback and indicators on the code (compliance PEP8, pyflakes, potentially malicious softwares etc.)
