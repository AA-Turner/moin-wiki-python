= Create a server that tests uploaded packages on PyPI. =

== Work to be done ==

The work is separated into three steps:

 1. a solution capable of running scripts when an event occurs (a new release of project X is available on PyPI)
 2. a Continuous integration server able to run the testsuite for those distributions
 3. a quality mesurement tool, able to provide feedback and indicators on the code (compliance PEP8, pyflakes, potentially malicious softwares etc.)

== What do people want ==

=== What do people what to run ===

* Run quality indicators about the code
* Run quality indicators about the packaging (compat with du2 standards for instance)
* Run Test
* Run setup.

=== What do people what to know ===

* Report about the run itself (does the test pass ? does the install went well ?)
* Report about system access done (FS network)
* Report about resource used ? (bonus)
