My homepage is at

My main intellectual interests are 

 * how people use information to make decisions 
 * how people use languages to present and to learn information 
 * climate change as a broadly encompassing instance of #1 and #2 
 * geophysics and geophysics modeling to inform #3. 

This all seems coherent to me, though to others it sometimes seems like I'm all over the place.

I am pleased to have discovered Python, which plays a role all four pursuits. 

I have met an amazing array of amazing people since becoming involved in the Python community. I consider both the language and the community a beacon of hope in gloomy times.
