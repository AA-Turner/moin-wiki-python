Jython is a Python interpreter implemented in Java. It can be fully integrated into existing Java applications; alternatively, Python applications can be compiled into a collection of Java classes. Python programs running on the Jython virtual machine have full access to the Java classes and APIs. More about Jython can be found at the following places:
