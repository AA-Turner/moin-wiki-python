'''Jython'''

Jython is a Python interpreter implemented in Java. It can be fully integrated into own Java applications or alternatively Python applications - which have full access to Java classes - can be compiled into Java classes. More about Jython can be found here: [http://www.jython.org].

(Somebody who knows please update this page with what's ''really'' happening with Jython.  The Jython home page hasn't been updated for over a year and Brian Zimmer's development blog is 404.)
