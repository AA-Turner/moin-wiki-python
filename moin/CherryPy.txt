CherryPy is a Python-based tool for developing dynamic web sites. It uses many powerful concepts together, which makes it unique in its approach to web site development.

It has been used in production for nearly a year and has proven fast and stable.
Key properties/features of CherryPy are:

    * Based exclusively on Python (runs everywhere Python runs)
    * Sits between a compiler and an application server
    * Delivers fast, robust, and scalable web sites
    * Developers can use OOP as well as AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) concepts to develop web sites
    * True separation of content and presentation
    * Simple but powerful templating language
    * "HTML editor safe" templating language (templates can go back and forth between designers and developers)
    * Powerful standard libraries to make your life easy

Other properties/features are:

    * Can be linked to many databases (["Oracle"], ["Sybase"], ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"], ...)
    * Can run behind another webserver (Apache, ...)
    * Easy clustering and load-balancing set up for high-traffic web sites
    * Built-in caching capability
