= General hints =
/!\ Currently the PythonCd is at an early stage. Although it is basically usable, it still needs some polishing, testing and bug fixing. So at this time, these download sources are intended for its developers and testers only, not for educational purposes and beginners. We will remove this comment as soon as it is ready for prime time.

= Where you can get the PythonCd on the internet =
 * ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/Linux/LOCAL/PythonCD/ (Germany)
 * (please make some additional mirrors in other parts of the world)

You will find a README there with some words about what you will get by downloading the `*.iso` file and a `*.iso.md5` file which is used for checking if your download was successful. If there are multiple `*.iso` files, you only need to get the latest release, there is a `yyyy-mm-dd` timestamp in the file name.

= Checking integrity of the ISO image =
After downloading `pythoncd-xxxx-xx-xx.iso` and `pythoncd-xxxx-xx-xx.iso.md5` use this Linux command to check if the download is OK:
{{{
md5sum -c pythoncd-xxxx-xx-xx.iso.md5
# if it doesn't complain, everything is ok
}}}

`xxxx-xx-xx` has to be replaced by the real date in the file name, e.g. `2004-07-02`, of course.

= Burning the CD =
The `*.iso` ISO-image file must be burned on a CDR/CDRW media of appropriate size (currently 700MB). Better use CDRW media to be able to overwrite them again when a new version is released.

Make sure you choose the right option of your CD burning software which makes a CD from an ISO image.

/!\ Do not master a fresh data CD containing the ISO file as a regular data file, this is wrong and won't boot nor work as intended in any other way.

= Booting from the CD =
/!\ You maybe have to enter your PC's BIOS and change '''Boot sequence''' to '''CDROM,C,A''' (or something similar) to make you PC boot from a bootable CD like the PythonCd.

Then you should get the boot prompt from the PythonCd. Just enter one of these boot options and hit <ENTER>:
||en24||english and kernel 2.4||
||en26||english and kernel 2.6||
||de24||german and kernel 2.4||
||de26||german and kernel 2.6||

`en26` is the default if you just hit <ENTER>. The PythonCd then should boot and show a fluxbox windowmanager (try right mouse button!) and a mozilla browser to you. Have fun!
