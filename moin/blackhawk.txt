Hi to everybody

I'm a student of Computer Science at the Dokuz Eylul University that is located in Izmir,TURKEY.

I'm novice at Python and there are more times to understand this snake:)

The story that I start to be interested with this language is related a dream I saw. I saw Dennis Ritchie and he said me that 'If you want to be  an expert at C, you should start from python!'.No,this is joke. The real story is that I read a survey in a site. In that survey Trevor Blackwell,one of developer of Viaweb, suggested Python as a language before C and I decided to agree this suggestion and now I devote myself to Python:)
