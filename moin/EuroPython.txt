== EuroPython started in 2002 ==

The [[https://www.europython.eu/|EuroPython]] conference series was started in 2002 as a community initiative by a team of Python enthusiast in Europe to bring together Python and Zope users and developers, as well as provide an opportunity for those who are interested in these technologies to learn more about them.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20020802042807/http://www.europython.org/|EuroPython 2002]] was the first major entirely community driven and organized Python event world-wide.

Since then, EuroPython has come a long way is now the largest event in Europe for all topics where Python is used, e.g. web technologies, science, data science, numerics, high performance computing, robotics, networking, etc.

== EuroPython Society ==

In 2004, the ''EuroPython Society'' was created as non-profit organization to provide a legal body for the organization, owning the trademark, managing the EuroPython organization and helping grow Python in Europe by offering grants and support for other conferences and events.
