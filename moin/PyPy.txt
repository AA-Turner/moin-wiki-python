PyPy is a Python implementation in Python. Yes, it can interpret itself!

Please refer to [http://codespeak.net/pypy the PyPy home page] for more information
about this upcoming Python implementation. 

Has anyone looked at this very small JVM implementation for some ideas? http://www.rtjcom.com/ If we want to have Python run on low-memory systems then this will help.
