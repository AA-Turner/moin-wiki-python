= PyPy =

PyPy is a Python implementation in Python. Yes, it can interpret itself!

Please refer to [http://codespeak.net/pypy the PyPy home page] for more information
about this upcoming Python implementation. 

PyPy 1.0 was released on 27/03/2007 http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.0.0.html

It includes a simple JIT compiler, [http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ Boehm garbage collector] and a whole lot of "backends" - C, LLVM, JavaScript, CLI, Java.

Has anyone looked at this very small JVM implementation for some ideas? http://www.rtjcom.com/ If we want to have Python run on low-memory systems then this will help.

There are other small JVMs which are genuinely open source (unlike [http://www.rtjcom.com/ simpleRTJ]), and a list of such projects can be found [http://www.kaffe.org/links.shtml via the Kaffe project site]. -- PaulBoddie
