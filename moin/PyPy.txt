= PyPy =

PyPy is a Python implementation in Python. Yes, it can interpret itself!

Please refer to [http://codespeak.net/pypy the PyPy home page] for more information
about this upcoming Python implementation. 

----

Has anyone looked at this very small JVM implementation for some ideas? http://www.rtjcom.com/ If we want to have Python run on low-memory systems then this will help.

There are other small JVMs which are genuinely open source (unlike [http://www.rtjcom.com/ simpleRTJ]), and a list of such projects can be found [http://www.kaffe.org/links.shtml via the Kaffe project site]. -- PaulBoddie
