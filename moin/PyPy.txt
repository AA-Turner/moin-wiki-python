PyPy is a Python implementation in Python. Yes, it can interpret itself!

Please refer to [[http://codespeak.net/pypy|the PyPy home page]] for more information
about this upcoming Python implementation. 

PyPy 1.0 was released on 27/03/2007 http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.0.0.html

It includes a JIT compiler, stackless-like functionality, uses the [[http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/|Boehm garbage collector]] and has whole lot of "backends" - C, LLVM, JavaScript, CLI, Java.

PyPy 1.1 was released on 28/04/2009 http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.1.0.html

Some of the backends supported in 1.0 (namely The LLVM and the JS backends) have been dropped "because they were unmaintained and/or buggy". The old JIT has also been dropped in favor of a new one that is under active development.
