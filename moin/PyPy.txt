PyPy is a Python implementation in Python. Yes, it can interpret itself!

Please refer to the [[http://pypy.org|PyPy home page]] and [[http://codespeak.net/pypy|development site]] for more information about this Python implementation. 

[[http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.0.0.html|PyPy 1.0]] was released on 27/03/2007

It includes a JIT compiler, stackless-like functionality, uses the [[http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/|Boehm garbage collector]] and has whole lot of "backends" - C, LLVM, !JavaScript, CLI, Java.

[[http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.1.0.html|PyPy 1.1]] was released on 28/04/2009

Some of the backends supported in 1.0 (namely The LLVM and the JS backends) have been dropped "because they were unmaintained and/or buggy". The old JIT has also been dropped in favor of a new one that is under active development.

[[http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.2.0.html|PyPy 1.2]] was released on 12/03/2010

The emphasis of this release is performance, with the JIT-enabled implementation known to outperform CPython on some real-world applications and benchmarks.

[[http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.3.0.html|PyPy 1.3]] was released on 26/06/2010

There are two principal areas of improvement in this release: stabilisation of the just-in-time compiler, and alpha-level support for the loading of CPython extension modules written in C.
