This page contains general information about the Python BuildBot setup and issues. 
||<tablestyle="border:0;background-color:#eeeeee;text-align:center;width:100%"> [http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/all/ Here are the current BuildBot results.] ||

There are several unstable tests and other issues.  These are not problems with BuildBot, but rather are problems with Python and/or the environment it is built/run in.

|| Platform      || Version || Issue ||
|| Mac OS X 10.3 || 2.[45]  || getaddrinfo configure check fails sometimes ||
|| cygwin        || 2.5     || test_bsddb3 crashes interpreter (old version of BSD DB?), test_curses, test_socketserver, test_time fail ||
|| OpenBSD (x86) || 2.4     || test_compare fails sometimes probably due to missing backport of fixes to test for negative address handling ||
|| Ubuntu (hppa) || 2.5     || test_fork1, test_wait[34] fail (hang) sometimes on hppa ||
|| Tru64 (alpha) || 2.[45]  || test_signal fails (hangs) sometimes.  The minimal set I was able to use to reproduce:  test_thread test_audioop test_tcl test_ctypes test_runpy test_zipfile test_decimal test_fork1 test_signal ||
|| All           || 2.[45]  || Berkeley DB 3.2 is killed when running test_bsddb3, test_bsddb fails ||
|| All           || 2.[45]  || test_socket{,ssl,_server} fail if another test instance is running ||

Here's a list of currently unexplained test failures:

   * None?

We need to add more platforms (and compilers!) to the BuildBot farm.  If you have one of these machines you are willing to run BuildBot on, please contact python-dev@python.org:

   * Windows (and see BuildbotOnWindows)
   * AIX
   * HP-UX
   * FreeBSD, NetBSD

It might also be beneficial to run on older versions of operating systems or others not mentioned above.  Feel free to contact us if you would like to offer another type of system.

Installing a buildslave
-----------------------

You need to fetch the latest [http://buildbot.sf.net buildbot source]. It requires Python and Twisted.

A buildslave also needs subversion, and it needs to be able to build Python. 

Unpack and install it.

Create a new user "buildbot" (highly recommended)

% su - buildbot

% mkdir buildarea

% buildbot slave `pwd`/buildarea dinsdale.python.org:9020 slavename slavepasswd

You'll need to get someone to create the slavename/slavepasswd on dinsdale.python.org before doing this. Talk to someone like Martin, Anthony or Neal to do this.

Then edit buildarea/info/admin and buildarea/info/host to set them appropriately. 

Finally, start buildbot with:

% buildbot start ~/buildarea

Required ports
--------------

In order for the buildbot to operate properly, it needs access to various TCP ports on the internet.  Below is a list of known ports and hosts.

|| Port  || Host       || Description ||
|| 80    || python.org || test_urllibnet ||
|| 995   || gmail.org  || test_socket_ssl ||
|| 50007 || localhost  || test_socket ||
|| 50008 || (listen)   || test_socket ||
|| 9020  || python.org || Buildbot connection ||
|| 9020  || localhost  || test_logging will try up to 9120 ||
