This page contains general information about the Python BuildBot setup and issues.  [http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/ Here are the current BuildBot results.]

There are several unstable tests and other issues.  These are not problems with BuildBot, but rather are problems with Python and/or the environment it is built/run in.

|| Platform      || Version || Issue ||
|| Solaris 10    || 2.[45]  || test_pty is not stable, sometimes it passes, sometimes it fails ||
|| Mac OS X 10.3 || 2.[45]  || getaddrinfo configure check fails sometimes ||
|| All           || 2.[45]  || Berkeley DB 3.2 and 4.1 fail tests (4.2 works) (x86 has 4.1) ||
|| All           || 2.4     || Berkeley DB 4.2 is not detected by setup.py (should this be fixed or not?) ||

We need to add more platforms to the BuildBot farm.  If you have one of these machines you are willing to run BuildBot on, please contact python-dev@python.org:

   * Windows
   * AIX
   * HP-UX
   * FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD

It might also be beneficial to run on older versions of operating systems or others not mentioned above.  Feel free to contact us if you would like to offer another type of system.
