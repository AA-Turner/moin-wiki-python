This page contains general information about the Python BuildBot setup and issues. 
||<tablestyle="border:0;background-color:#eeeeee;text-align:center;width:100%"> [http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/all/ Here are the current BuildBot results.] ||

There are several unstable tests and other issues.  These are not problems with BuildBot, but rather are problems with Python and/or the environment it is built/run in.

|| Platform      || Version || Issue ||
|| Mac OS X 10.3 || 2.[45]  || getaddrinfo configure check fails sometimes ||
|| OpenBSD       || 2.[45]  || Failures: test_compare test_email test_email_renamed test_socket ||
|| OSF1 V5       || 2.[45]  || When building with cc (not gcc) test_file and test_pty fail.  test_file fails because sys.stdin.seek(-1) causes the interpreter to exit.  test_pty seems to have whitespace differences. ||
|| All           || 2.[45]  || Berkeley DB 3.2 is killed when running test_bsddb3, test_bsddb fails ||
|| All           || 2.[45]  || test_socket fails if another test instance is running ||

We need to add more platforms to the BuildBot farm.  If you have one of these machines you are willing to run BuildBot on, please contact python-dev@python.org:

   * Windows (and see BuildbotOnWindows)
   * AIX
   * HP-UX
   * FreeBSD, NetBSD

It might also be beneficial to run on older versions of operating systems or others not mentioned above.  Feel free to contact us if you would like to offer another type of system.
