= Overview =
[[https://plotly/|Plotly]] is a collaborative, web-based graphing and analytics platform.

=== Plotting Library and Web App ===
[[https://plot.ly/|Plotly]] allows users to import, copy and paste, or stream data to be analyzed and visualized. For analysis and styling graphs, Plotly offers a Python sandbox (NumPy supported), datagrid, and GUI. Python scripts can be saved, shared, and collaboratively edited in Plotly.

The [[https://plot.ly/api/python/|Plotly Python graphing library]] is a scientific graphing library. Graphs can be styled with Python and a GUI, and shared with a URL for others to view, collaborate, or save a copy.

=== Installation ===
Users can install and sign up for Plotly from the terminal. See [[https://plot.ly/api/python|documentation]] for walk-through and sign-up steps: https://plot.ly/api/python.

{{{
  $ pip install plotly
}}}
or

{{{
  $ easy_install plotly
}}}
=== Using Plotly and IPython ===
Plotly also integrates with IPython to create interactive graphs in a Notebook. A few examples are available in [[https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/IPython-plotly/tree/master/|the gallery]] that show how to use LaTeX, GapMinder bubble charts, NumPy, pandas, datetime, and MATLAB in IPython.
