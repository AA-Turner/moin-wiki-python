Plotly is a collaborative, web-based graphing and analytics platform.

The [[https://plot.ly/|Plotly web interface]] allows users to import and analyze data with a Python shell (NumPy supported) and datagrid. A Python environment and GUI allow users to create and style interactive, web-based graphs (''[[https://plot.ly/~bchartoff/344/|see e.g.]]''). Python scripts can be saved, shared, and collaboratively edited in Plotly.

The [[https://plot.ly/api/python/|Plotly Python graphing library]] is a scientific graphing library. Graphs can be made with Python and a GUI, and shared with a URL for others to view, collaborate, or save a copy. The package is available [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=plotly&version=0.5.2&:action=display|here]] and on [[https://github.com/plotly/python-api|GitHub]]. Plotly can be installed from the terminal in two ways (see [[plot.ly/api/python|documentation]] for walk-through and sign-up steps).

{{{
  $ pip install plotly
}}}
or

{{{
  $ easy_install plotly
}}}
Plotly also integrates with IPython to create interactive graphs in a Notebook. A few examples:
