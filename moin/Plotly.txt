= Overview =

[[https://plotly/|Plotly]] is a collaborative, web-based graphing and analytics platform. 

=== Plotting Library and Web App ===

[[https://plot.ly/|Plotly]] allows users to import, copy and paste, or stream data to be analyzed and visualized. For analysis and styling graphs, Plotly offers a Python sandbox (NumPy supported), datagrid, and GUI. Python scripts can be saved, shared, and collaboratively edited in Plotly.

The [[https://plot.ly/api/python/|Plotly Python graphing library]] is a scientific graphing library. Graphs can be styled with Python and a GUI, and shared with a URL for others to view, collaborate, or save a copy. 

=== Installation ===

Users can install and sign up for Plotly from the terminal (see [[plot.ly/api/python|documentation]] for walk-through and sign-up steps).

{{{
  $ pip install plotly
}}}
or

{{{
  $ easy_install plotly
}}}

=== Using Plotly and IPython ===

Plotly also integrates with IPython to create interactive graphs in a Notebook. A few examples:
