The Chairman is responsible for setting up and running the board meetings.  The Secretary is usually responsible for taking minutes.  For a schedule of upcoming meetings, see PythonSoftwareFoundationBoard.  

Tasks for board meetings include:

  * Email psf-board a week ahead of time with reminder and draft agenda, requesting additions for the agenda.  Be sure to include the meeting time and date (best in UTC).

  * Email psf-board again a few days ahead with final agenda and meeting time and date.

  * A typical agenda has these parts:

    * Roll call: State your names
    * Identify who takes minutes
    * Approve minutes from prior board meeting(s)
    * Review action items from last minutes
    * New business / discussion
      * (add items here for each meeting)
    * Progress reports / other

    Add the URLs to appropriate resources (like draft minutes) directly to the agenda.

  * Run the meeting on IRC by keeping conversation on track and moving any lengthy discussion to email. Review of action items is aided by the list kept in the meeting minutes (see below).
