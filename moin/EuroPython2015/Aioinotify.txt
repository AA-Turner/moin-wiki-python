Aioinotify is going to be a asyncio library for Linux inotify

Inotify is an interface on Linux to get notifications about file system events.

On Saturday 25th we'll:
 * Define a pythonic interface for the Library
 * Code the initial implementation
 * Create a short guide with examples plus API docs
 * Write tests
 * Create proper packaging

Join us if you want to be a co-founder of a brand new Python project and influence it from the start.

A proof of concept for creating a inotify pipe and reading from it with asyncio exists, so the thing is definitely doable. However, no proper library code exists yet.

As the project is brand new, so all kinds of tasks from writing code to docs and registering it to pypi and readthedocs exist. This might also be an excellent opportunity to get acquainted with asyncio and write a tutorial while doing it!
