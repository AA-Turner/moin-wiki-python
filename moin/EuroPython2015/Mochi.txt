= Mochi Sprint at EuroPython 2015 =

[[https://github.com/i2y/mochi|Mochi]] is a new functional language that is written in Python 3 and compiles down to Python 3. It provides interesting functional feature while keeping two-way compatability with Python 3 (CPython and PyPy). There was a [[https://ep2015.europython.eu/conference/talks/functional-python-with-mochi|talk]] about Mochi at EuroPython 2015.
The [[http://www.python-academy.com/talks/europython2015/Functional%20Python%20with%20Mochi.slides.html|talk slides]] and the
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv7Whze78ac|video]] (start at 2:20:30) give more details.

== Potential Sprint Topics ==

=== Documentation ===

 * Start documentation for syntax
 * Start documentation for builtin functions
 * Create a tutorial
 * Create a simple sample application written in Mochi

=== Language Features ===

 * Support for Python 3.5
 * Replace a part of the builtin functions with toolz/cytoolz or a similar module (This may reduce documentation cost for builtin functions.)

=== Testing ===

 * More tests ([[https://github.com/i2y/mochi/blob/master/doc/TESTS.rst|testing guide]])

=== IPython Notebook Kernel ===

 * Fix stderr (should go to notebook to not only to console) 
 * Include kernel source into Mochi source
 * Add support for magic functions
 * Add call tips and help with "?"
