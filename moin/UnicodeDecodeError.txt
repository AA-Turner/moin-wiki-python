Paradoxically, a {{{UnicodeDecodeError}}} happens when _encoding_.  The cause of it seems to be the encoding-specific {{{encode()}}} functions that normally expect a parameter of type {{{unicode}}}.  It appears that on seeing an {{{str}}} parameter, the {{{encode()}}} functions "up-convert" it into {{{unicode}}} before applying its own encoding.  It also appears that the "up-conversion" makes no assumption of {{{str}}} parameter's encoding, assuming it to be {{{ascii}}}.  Hence a decoding failure inside an encoder.

{{{
#!python
>>> "a".encode("utf-8")
'a'
>>> u"\u0411".encode("utf-8")
'\xd0\x91'
>>> "\xd0\x91".encode("utf-8")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
}}}
