=== Deployment Platforms ===

Requires Apache and mod_python; is therefore constrained by the deployment requirements of those components.

=== Suitability ===

=== Development Interfaces ===

Seems to focus on templating and rather simple published handler functions inside Python modules.

=== Environment Access ===

Provides a configuration mechanism and employs a context containing application-related data for convenient access by the presentation templates.

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

Provides filesystem and relational database sessions, along with authentication support.

=== Persistence Support ===

Does not appear to provide explicit support for persistence mechanisms (apart from the session support mentioned above).

=== Presentation Support ===

Uses Zope 3's TAL for templating.

The usage of Apache and mod_python seems to dictate hosting options.
