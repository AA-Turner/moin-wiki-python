Describe FredrikLundh here, [http://effbot.org there], [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=%22Fredrik+Lundh%22 everywhere].

I work for the SecretLabs, also known as PythonWare.  We do lots of PythonStuff,
including PythonWorks, and the PythonImagingLibrary.   We also work on TkInter and various
part of the PythonInterpreter itself (the RegularExpression library, UniCode, XmlRpcLib).
But we spend most of our time building large PythonPowered systems, mostly for meteorology
(satellite and radar image production, all the way from the source to end-user products).
