Here are some of the findings in the webconferencing openspace session and #av-clubroom discord discussion at !EuroPython 2020.

= Hardware =

== Webcams ==

== Aukey PC-LM1E Webcam SKU ITAN1014662 ==

Function:
 * standard webcam for PC

Pros:
 * just works with linux, e.g. with guvcview on ubuntu 20.04
 * available, ca. 49 EUR

Cons:
 * 65 degress wide angle (so little of "you" in lots of "room around you")
 * default settings seem to be too white, can be adjusted via sw


== Headsets (Headphones with Microphone) ==

=== MPOW HC5 Bluetooth Headset X0016X73LR ===

Function:
 * over-the-ears BT5 headphones
 * Microphone

Pros:
 * works as headset with Android phone (speakers+mic)
 * works as headphones with PC (speakers only)

Cons:
 * '''does not work as headset (speakers+mic) with BT4 USB adapter at computer'''
 * '''does not work as headset (speakers+mic) via 1Mii B10 at computer''' (not able to switch to "call" mode)


== Bluetooth Adapters ==

=== 1Mii USB Bluetooth Audio Transmitter B10 EAN X0014UJEH3 ===

Function:
 * for computer it is just a USB "sound card"
 * internally, it transmits sound output via BT5 to headphones speakers
 * internally, it receives sound input via BT5 from headset microphone
 * 2 modes, switch by hw button:
   * music - high quality (aptX) - output only
   * call - lower quality - input/output

Pros:
 * just a soundcard, keeps all the BT stuff away from computer
 * nice for Qubes OS (just forward USB device to VM with teleconf sw)
 * nice for Linux and BT5 (not [m]any working BT5 adapters yet)
 * some stuff "just works"

Cons:
 * lots of states signalled via single multicolor LED
 * misc. state changing inputs via a single hw button
 * no "debugging" possible if something BT does not work
 * just a soundcard, no BT exposed to computer

== plugable Bluetooth USB Adaptor USB-BT4LE X0004WCG5T ==
 * BT 4.0 LE + classic BT
 * just works with Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)

= Software =

== Linux Webcam Software ==

=== guvcview ===
 * quite to adjust camera parameters
 * good video quality
 * just works on Ubuntu 20.04

=== OBS Studio ===

Pro:
 * packages for Linux, old .deb package + recent snap for Ubuntu 20.04
 * powerful processing / mixing / assembling of video output signal from misc sources

Con:
 * to emulate a virtual webcam (which then can be used by your video conf software)
   you need an extra plugin and a kernel module and you might need to compile some stuff.
