Ultraseek Server, a commercial search engine product,
is implemented as an elaborate multi-threaded Python program with
primitive indexing and search operations performed by a
built-in module.  Most of the program is written in Python, and
both the built-in spider and HTTP server can be customized with
additional Python code.  The program contains over 11,000 lines of
Python code, and the user interface is implemented with over
17,000 lines of Python-scripted HTML templates.

Python.



== Games ==


[http://crystal.sourceforge.net Crystal Space]

The Crystal Space 3D Engine uses python for scripting through
a plug-in mechanism.  Python scripts can be dynamically invoked
from within the engine depending on game specific
actions.  Python can also be used to actually program the main
game core.  It has full access to the C++ Crystal Space
API.

[http://www.bridgecommander.com Star Trek Bridge Commander]

The game "Star Trek Bridge Commander" by <a
href="http://www.totallygames.com Totally Games] uses Python
both as the mission scripting language and also for a ton of other
features.  Other commercial games that have used Python include
"Greyhawk: The Temple of Elemental Evil"  and "Blade of Darkness".
There's [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/gamescriptinginpython.html a paper from the 2002 Game Developer Confere
nce] that provides
more information about Python and game development.

[http://www.planetquake.com/quark/ Quark] (Quake Army Knife)

Quark is a level-editor for Quake, Quake II and Half-Life
written mostly in Python.  One can also write plug-ins for it in
Python.



== Graphics ==


[http://www.ilm.com Industrial Light & Magic]

ILM uses Python in the production of their FX, as described in
the RenderMan Course Notes from Siggraph 2001 (they name "The
Phantom Menace", "The Mummy Returns" and other productions as ones
where Python was used...).

Walt Disney Feature Animation is also using Python to add
scriptability to their animation production system.

[http://www.hks.com/ HKS, Inc. (ABAQUS/CAE)]

Hibbitt, Karlsson & Sorensen, Inc. have incorporated Python
into their ABAQUS/CAE finite element analysis programs.  From their
March, 1998 product newsletter:

    "One of the keys to enhanced productivity is the ability to
    customize the user interface of ABAQUS/CAE easily for
    particular applications. To achieve this goal, we have
    embedded the Python programming language (www.python.org) as
    a command scripting and GUI extensibility tool."

[http://www.letterror.com/code/robofog/ RoboFog]

RoboFog is a scriptable font editor for the Macintosh. It
is basically good old Fontographer with an embedded Python
interpreter. Developed by Petr van Blokland, Just van Rossum
and Erik van Blokland.

[http://www.caligari.com/ Caligari Corporation]

Caligari Corporation's flagship product, trueSpace, uses
Python to allow users rapid prototyping with
scripting. trueSpace is a 3D modeling and animation tool, and
with Python, users can now create custom modeling and
animation effects, as well as create a simple interactive
application or a game prototype entirely inside trueSpace.

http://www.blender3d.com Blender 3D]

The 3D modeling program Blender 3D makes use of Python as an
extension language.  Blender 3D is a free program with a large
community of users.

scripting language.





== Financial ==


[http://www.abnamro.com/ ABN AMRO Bank, Treasury
Systems]

The trade to risk management interfaces translate new and
updated trade information from our trading system to the,
internally written, bank-wide risk information system.  SWIG
was used to wrap the required parts of the 3rd party C++
trading system class library; we also wrapped the CORBA
interface to the risk system using SWIG.  Python was used to
describe the structural and field value mapping. There are
3052 lines of Python code in the system.

[http://www.bellco.org Bellco Credit Union]

The online banking system for Bellco Credit Union is written
in Python.  The product is known as SAFE (Secure Access Financial
