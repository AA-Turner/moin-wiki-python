== Overview ==

Leo is a power tool for people who want to organize, study and work with data, especially complex data like computer programs, books, web sites and data bases. Superficially, Leo may look like other outlining programs, code folding editors or class browsers, but it most certainly is not.

People say Leo is a revolutionary tool, and that Leo is fun to use, even addictive. There is a unique “Leo way” of managing data; the term ''Leonine'' describes how people treat data in “the world according to Leo”. Leo definitely takes a bit of work to understand. Leo’s users speak of an “Aha” moment, when they see how these pieces fit together: outline structure is significant everywhere.
