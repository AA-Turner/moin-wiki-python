= Welcome to your Python CD! =

This is a bootable CD based on Debian GNU/Linux (and derived from [http://knoppix.de/ KNOPPIX]).

The special thing about it is that it has lots of Python stuff!

= Contents =
 * PythonCdDocs - lots of documentation contained on this CD (read them ;) )
 * PythonCdRawPackageList - raw list of installed debian packages
 * PythonCdToDo - what we plan for the future
