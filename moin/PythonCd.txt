= Welcome to your Python CD! =

This is a bootable CD based on [http://debian.org/ Debian GNU/Linux] and [http://knoppix.de/ KNOPPIX].

The special thing about it is that it has lots of Python stuff!

= Contents =
 * PythonCdDocs - lots of documentation contained on this CD (read them ;) )
 * PythonCdRawPackageList - raw list of installed debian packages
 * PythonCdFun - the funny part of it
 * PythonCdToDo - what we plan for the future
 * PythonCdContributors - hall of fame ;)
