Generator Tricks for System Programmers by David Beazley

Ivan Krstic

They all were wanting for greater quality of content

- web2py open space talk w/ Massimo Di Pierro

Lightning talk format is great.

Lightning talks

Plenary: OLPC Update

honestly, most i saw were junk. too short, so by the time the
presenter motivated the talk, time was up. and 40m/talk? that made
it impossible to make sure you were at the next one at a normal
time. how about starting talks on the hour. simple.

The Twisted SFC membership announcement. I'm feeling The Love!

Ivan Kristov - OLPC Keynote

honestly, almost none of the talks i heard are worth mentioning -
they were all too short (every presenter was rushed), the timing
was hard to gauge (since everything started on odd times, 40m past
some hours, 10 after other, etc), and quite frankly not that many
presenters were well prepared.

Twisted Announcement/Keynote

Richard Jones' Pyglet talk (why not listed?)

Lightning talks on PVote, NoonHat, and SaturdayHouse

No.106, towards interactive, distributed and rapid testing

Teach me Twisted open spaces session!

lightening talks

All of them seemed to be really really good...

Halloween app

some of the openspace meetings + lightning talks where really useful
as just meeting people during the conference

I rather enjoyed many of the lightning talks. I just wish you guys
had scheduled those online and were a bit more organized with them.

Ivan Krstic - OLPC update

Making Client-Side Python Suck Less OLPC Update

agile web testing

The lightning talks and bof about metaweb/freebase

"Teach Me Twisted" - Steve Holden

repoze - chris mcdonough

I really enjoyed the tutorial on TurboGears and Pylons. Good teachers
and very informative.

The Twisted BoF at 8-10 on Saturday; most keynotes v. good as well.

Hallway track

sunday keynote on status of OLPC

I missed a lot of the talks I wanted to see...

Due to volunteering, I wasn't able to focus on the talks. I hope
to catch up when we get the video online.

I decide how much to submit

I originally wasn't sure if Python would be usable in my work, but
I'm picking it up to do web projects personally - I think I will
put in for some reimbursement though as I got a lot of great ideas
that I can use even if I'm not successful in bringing python to our
systems.

I paid for my food, and for lodging during sprints; registration,
travel, and hotel during conference covered by school/employer

I paid for the conference days, my employer paid for me to attend
the Sprint.

I received Python Software Foundation financial aid this year. woot.
