List yourself below, along with:

I Already Have a Room Reservation
=================================

If you're looking for a roommate to share costs, list your info below.

**Note:** Be sure to list the names of your roommates on the reservation
as having permission to check in, so they can get a key to your shared
room from the front desk (by showing photo ID).

* kippesp [a] gmail.com - Room reserved from 3/12 - 3/20; I'm sharing with one other from the dfwpython group; looking for one or two more to share the room.
