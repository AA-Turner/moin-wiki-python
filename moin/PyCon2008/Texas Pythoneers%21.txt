All PyCon participants hailing from the Republic of Texas are invited to attend this short BoF session in the Heathrow Room Friday from 5:30 - 6:15. We want to get as much feedback as possible to plan our next Texas Un-conference. We are tentatively planning to hold it in September in Austin. This will be a similar follow-on to last year's successful `gathering in Houston <http://pycamp.python.org/Texas/HomePage>`_.
