**Project Info**

The py lib aims at supporting a decent development process addressing
deployment, versioning, testing and documentation perspectives.

Among the main motivation for the py lib and its flagship py.test
tool were:

- to test applications with a testing tool that provides advanced
  features out of the box, yet allows full customization per-project.
- distribute applications in an ad-hoc way both for testing and
  for application integration purposes.
- help with neutralizing platform and python version differences
- offer a uniform way to access local and remote file resources
- offer some unique features like micro-threads (greenlets)
