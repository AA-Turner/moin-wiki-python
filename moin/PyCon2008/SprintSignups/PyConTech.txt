**Project Info**

PyCon-Tech is a conference management framework based on Django
framework. While PyCon-Tech is intended for the various Python
Conferences, anyone can use the framework or Apps therein which are
released under the Python License. The page you are reading right now
is being served up by the PyCon-Tech Wiki. PyCon-Tech has grown into a
website building framework with pluggable applications for building
wiki's, web site generation, feed replication, navigation bar,
surveys, cache management, times tables generation, and that is before
we get to anything conference related. PyCon-Tech it's no longer just
for building conference sites.
