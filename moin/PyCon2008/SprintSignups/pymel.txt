Project Info
------------

Pymel makes python scripting in Autodesk's Maya work the way it should.  By 
taking advantage of python's strengths -- particularly, a flexible, 
object-oriented design -- pymel builds on the default Maya modules by 
organizing its commands into a class hierarchy, and by customizing them to 
operate in a more succinct, intuitive, and pythonic way.
