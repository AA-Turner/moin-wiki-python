**Project Info**


Python for S60 is Python brought to over 100 million Nokia smartphones.
It combines the fun and power of Python with all the fancy features on
the modern mobile phone, such as camera, networking, bluetooth, gps and
various sensors.

This sprint gives you an opportunity to implement your wildest mobile
application idea in Python! Participants can implement a fully working
application using PyS60 and we will provide a bunch of shiny N95
smartphones and hands-on help during the sprint.

No previous experience on mobile programming, nor a mobile phone, is
required -- just bring your own laptop.
