A sprint which is open to anyone who wishes to consolidate existing Python 
web framework development efforts by utilizing and sharing WSGI components 
(see http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi).

Sprint Leaders: Chris McDonough, Tres Seaver 

Repository: We'll be using the repository at http://svn.repoze.org, although 
we will also use individual web framework project repositories as necessary
