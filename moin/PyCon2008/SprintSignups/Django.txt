Sign Up for a Sprint!
======================

Are you interested in sprinting in this project? Great! 

Django has a `signup page of their own 
<http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SprintPyCon2008>`__, 
please use that one.

If you're not sure which project to join, you can register in the
`generic sprint sign-up page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2008/SprintSignups>`__.

See you at PyCon!
