**Project Info**

PyPy is a python compiler written in Python.  It's also a very flexible 
compiler toolchain which can compile so called RPython (restricted Python,
a subset of Python without dynamic features) into a variety of platforms
including C/POSIX, JVM and CLI.  PyPy also features a set of experimental 
features, like different GCs or different threading models, which makes it
a good platform to experiment with the python language.

Sprint Leader: Maciej Fijalkowski

This sprint is newcomer-friendly sprint. The list of task is as usual
very long and depending on attendees. It's suggested that people would
come to an IRC and chat a bit to have a clue what is feasible on a sprint
and what is not. For example, we can work on:

* JVM backend bindings for Java libraries
* Extending pypy as necessary for software X to run
* Adding more modules to pypy
* Sketching ctypes-based software, killing dependency on C modules
  written using C/CPython API.
* Optimizing certain parts of pypy for certain micro-benchmarks.
* Whatever else....

Software requirements: the details depends on what people would like to
work on, but in general pygame, libgc and libffi are very very useful (although
not needed). A PyPy checkout, gcc and such things are a must. For people
wanting to work on particular backends, appropriately Java, Mono (or .NET),
spidermonkey are needed.
