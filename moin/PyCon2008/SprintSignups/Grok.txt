Project Info
------------


Grok brings automatic, Rails-like auto-configuration functionality
to the Zope component framework and Zope web application server.
But this functionality is currently bound up inside of a single
"grok" module; you can't use, say, Grok's ability to auto-configure
Zope adapters without importing the whole dratted web framework
with it.
