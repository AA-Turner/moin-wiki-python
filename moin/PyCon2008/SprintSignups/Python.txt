**PyCon Details**

There will be a [http://us.pycon.org/2008/sprints/ tutorial] on developing and sprinting on Python's core Sunday evening at 16:40 (4:30 PM) for up to three hours. Details from how to find where something is in the code to best practices will be covered. If you are not familiar with core development please plan to attend the tutorial!

An email prior to PyCon (most likely be a couple of weeks) will be sent out stating what is expected of participants before they attend. This essentially consists of having Subversion installed along with a checkout of the code and a proper compiler installed on your laptop. Instructions on how to do this will be in the email.
