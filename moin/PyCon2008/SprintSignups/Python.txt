Project URL: http://www.python.org/

Sprint Leader: Brett Cannon

Accessing the source and docs:

- See http://www.python.org./dev/faq/ on how to access the source.
- See http://www.python.org/dev/ for developer documentation.

  development.

Developer pointers can be found from http://www.python.org/dev/ 

**PyCon Details**

There will also be a tutorial on developing and sprinting on Python's core Sunday evening at PyCon (time to be announced later). If you do not have prior experience  developing on the core please plan on attending! The tutorial will last a couple of hours and cover everything from how to best compile Python for development to best practices.

An email prior to PyCon (most likely be a couple of weeks) will be sent out stating what is expected of participants before they attend. This essentially consists of having Subversion and a proper compiler installed on your laptop. Instructions on how to do this will be in the email.
