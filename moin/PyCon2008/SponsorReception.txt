PyCon just wouldn't be the same - especially this year - without the help and support of our sponsors. 

We would love to meet you face to face and have the opportunity to thank you for your support of PyCon (and Python).

We will be having a sponsor 'thank you' reception on Saturday evening from 6-8pm at PyCon. You and those you have brought from your organizations are welcome to attend. Refreshments will be provided.

At about 7:00 pm we will have a few minutes of structured discussion. We are hoping to get some feedback about your experience sponsoring PyCon:

* How did we do?
* What worked well? What didn't?
* What changes would you suggest for next year?

Feel free to add any other questions that you would like to see addressed.

Please RSVP to pycon-sponsors@python.org so that we can get an accurate count for food.
