== Jaiku ==

[http://www.jaiku.com Jaiku] is a micro-blogging site like Twitter, but with some extra features.

Pre-existing members, though, do have a limited number of invitations they can give out.

On Jaiku there is a [http://jaiku.com/channel/PyCon #PyCon] channel as well as a general [http://jaiku.com/channel/python #python] channel.

== Pownce ==

From the site: "[http://www.pownce.com Pownce] is a way to send stuff to your friends. What kind of stuff? You can send just about anything: music, photos, messages, links, events, and more."  It's written in Python using Django and offers functionality similar to Twitter/Jaiku.
