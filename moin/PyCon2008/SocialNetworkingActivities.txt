This page is to keep track of how the various social networking sites are hosting PyCon content by users.

== Internet Relay Chat ==

During the conference, many attendees will chat using IRC on the
#pycon channel on irc.freenode.net.

== Twitter ==

During the conference, the organizers will post tasks and
volunteering opportunities to the [http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers/ pyconvolunteers] channel.


== Jaiku ==

[http://www.jaiku.com Jaiku] is a micro-blogging site like Twitter, but with some extra features. Unfortunately, as of this writing (2008-02-23) they are not open to accepting new accounts while they deal with their acquisition by Google. Pre-existing members, though, do have a limited number of invitations they can give out.

On Jaiku there is a [http://jaiku.com/channel/PyCon #PyCon] channel as well a general [http://jaiku.com/channel/python #python] channel.

== Flickr ==
