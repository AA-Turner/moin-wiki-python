This page is to keep track of how the various social networking sites are hosting PyCon content by users.

== PyCon Web Site ==

Use [http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/ the PyCon schedule application]
to plan your schedule.  You can click on events and talks
you'd like to attend, and 
then export your selected events in iCal format or print a
customized schedule.  Your choices are saved on the PyCon server, letting the organizers
compare the popularity of various talks and letting them change room assignments to meet
unexpected demand.

Each event has a perma-link and is now integrated with [http://www.addthis.com/ Add This!]
So it is easier to use the other social network options on this page directly from the schedule.

== Linked In ==

We have created a PyCon 2008 group on LinkedIn.
If you are registered for PyCon, your registration e-mail is already pre-approved for joining the group.

Join the [http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/64606/475053320818 PyCon 2008 Linked-In Conference Group].

== Internet Relay Chat ==

During the conference, many attendees will chat using IRC on the
#pycon channel on irc.freenode.net.

== Talk Slides/File Publishing ==

The PyCon [http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/ Schedule] supports the upload/download of slides, documents, images, etc.

To upload files for your talk, just go to the [http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/ schedule], bring up the tooltip for your talk, click on 'upload' under 'Files:' and fill in the form.

== SlideShare ==

Presentations in PowerPoint/OpenOffice/PDF format can be posted to
[http://www.slideshare.net/event/pycon-2008 the PyCon 2008 event].

Presenters, please be sure to also upload your talk slides and documents to the 
PyCon website's [http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/ schedule application].

== Flickr ==

Tag any photographs you take at PyCon with [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/pycon2008/ "pycon2008"].

== Twitter ==

Anyone can post to the [http://twitter.com/pycon PyCon twitter] channel.

During the conference, the organizers will post tasks and
volunteering opportunities to the [http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers/ pyconvolunteers] channel.

== Jaiku ==

[http://www.jaiku.com Jaiku] is a micro-blogging site like Twitter, but with some extra features. Unfortunately, as of this writing (2008-02-23) they are not open to accepting new accounts while they deal with their acquisition by Google. Pre-existing members, though, do have a limited number of invitations they can give out.

On Jaiku there is a [http://jaiku.com/channel/PyCon #PyCon] channel as well as a general [http://jaiku.com/channel/python #python] channel.

== Pownce ==

From the site: "[http://www.pownce.com Pownce] is a way to send stuff to your friends. What kind of stuff? You can send just about anything: music, photos, messages, links, events, and more."  It's written in Python using Django and offers functionality similar to Twitter/Jaiku.

== CrowdVine ==

There is now [http://pycon2008.crowdvine.com/ a CrowdVine community for PyCon 2008].  Once you 
sign up for the community, you can send comments to other members and write weblog posts that everyone can see.
