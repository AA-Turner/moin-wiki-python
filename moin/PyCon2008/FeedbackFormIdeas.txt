A couple of times, people have mentioned "Oh!  We should put X on the feedback forms this year!".  Well, this is a page to catch all the Xs.

Main Feedback Form
===================

* Integrate badges with printed version of survey

* Ask: Are you sharing your room?  (Sharing with friend, etc.)

* ask: Is this your first PyCon?


Tutorial Feedback Form
=======================

* ask: Is this your first PyCon?

* ask: Would you take a tutorial again next year?

* ask: Tutorial level: too advanced, too easy, just right?

* Clarify:

  - hotel => conference hotel (add: other hotel)
  - second tutorial day => + (assuming a tutorial of interest)
  - material => course content (subject matter)
  - handout => paper handout

* Fix no/yes to yes/no (order).

* The general section (hotel, conference/sprints, etc.) should be
  filled out only once per person.  Tutorial-specific questions should
  be answered once per tutorial.  Two separate forms?  One page,
  double-sided?
