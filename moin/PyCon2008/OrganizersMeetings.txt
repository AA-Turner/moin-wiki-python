Next meeting: Tuesday, September 25, at 18:00 UTC (2PM Eastern, 1PM Central, 12PM Mountain, 11AM Pacific).

Meetings will be held every 2 weeks on Tuesdays (for now).  Alternate Tuesdays will have `PyCon Tech meetings <https://pycon.coderanger.net/wiki/Meetings>`_.

Meetings are held via IRC. We use the '#pycon' channel on irc.freenode.net.  `Connection details here <PyCon2008/OrganizersMeetingsConnectionDetails>`__.

There is a `"PyCon 2008 Planning" Google calendar <https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=og3ea7a3ov1tb3e18qppkd4ev8%40group.calendar.google.com&mode=MONTH>`__.  If you want write access, ask David Goodger or Chris McAvoy (or just ask on `the pycon-organizers list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers>`__).


Agendas For Organizers' Meetings
===================================

(Please add items below.)

September 25
------------

* Call for Conference Talk Proposals & Call for Tutorial Proposals

  Dates:

  - Proposal submission deadline: October 31, 2007
  - Proposal acceptance: November 20, 2007
  - Tutorial cancellation date: February 10, 2008  (for inadequate attendance)
  - Papers, handouts deadline: March 1, 2008

  Questions:

  - Should we offer to waive registration for speakers?  Conference
    talk speakers only, or Tutorial presenters too?  (Perhaps in
    conjunction with reducing the maximum to $1200.)
  - What should we ask for in a proposal?
  - Should we require an accompanying paper?

* PR
