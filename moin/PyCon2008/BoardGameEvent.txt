Comments, Suggestions?

* I would like to see `Robo rally <http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18>`_. -- ?  Looks like we'll need a few experience players. - Dean
* I would like to play on Thursday after evening volunteer activities are completed. -- ? Sounds fun, but we may want to choose something light if we're tired from Tutorials and bag stuffing. -- Dean
* I've got Empire Builder, Russian Rails and Lunar Rails.  Need external interest for momentum, I enjoy these but am still learning. Longer play time. -- Dean
