Comments, Suggestions?
----------------------

* I (Dean) need your input on what time to advertise for the dedicated Board Game Social on Friday and Saturday evenings.  How should I be more specific than 7:00pm to 11:00pm?

* I am not sure I can make it, but I will bring my board games -- Sheila
* I would like to see `Robo rally <http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18>`_. -- ?  Looks like we'll need a few experience players. - Dean; I've only played it once I don't mind if the experienced players beat up on me. Wow! It's been reprinted. I just ordered it. -- Sheila :)  -- I'll bring my copy -- Jono.
* I would like to play on Thursday after evening volunteer activities are completed. -- ? Sounds fun, but we may want to choose something light if we're tired from Tutorials and bag stuffing. -- Dean; That's what Apples To Apples is for -- Sheila; Excellent! Carcassonne, Munchkin, and Chinese Checkers may also fit this bill. -Dean
* I've got Empire Builder, Russian Rails and Lunar Rails.  Need external interest of I'm going to haul them, I enjoy these but am still learning. Longer play time. -- Dean
* I'll bring the games I've mentioned above if there's solid interest; I might have to drive (vs. taking the El) if I'm bringing more than one, though. â€” Tom; I'm interested in Ticket to Ride, Fluxx and curious about Arkham. - Dean
* I have Kill Dr. Lucky if I can find it -- Sheila
* Any folks interested in Power Grid? - Dean
* I was curious what board game is most like Galcon, or if there's a particular game that would be themed for a Galcon varient? `Galcon Event <http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4529>`_.  `Hellas <http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4529>`_? 
* I wanna try Alien City--it's one of the Piecepack games.  http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/AlienCity --Larry
