'''Python and Tkinter Programming'''
 John E. Grayson

ISBN: ISBN:1884777813,
Manning Publications,
688 pages (February 2000) 

Presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion, with lots and lots of example code. At the moment this is the only guide to Tkinter programming in print, so this is the book to get if you want to learn Tkinter. 

Grayson's book is a master class in GUI development so it's a bit of a steep learning curve, even if you've done GUI programming before. He also uses Python Mega Widgets ( [http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/widgets.html widgets] )
) to illustrate how quickly sophisticated applications can be built with Python. (Louis Bertrand ''louis at bertrandtech dot on dot ca'')
