This page point issues related to [http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html Python Debugger] that will led to(hopefully) better Python debugging environment:  

 * bugfixes/functionality improvments in bug/patch tracker
 * write pdb's unit_tests  
 * look at other debuggers(Pythob/non-Python) and see if we can      learn something from it (I'm sure we can;) 
 * pdb's design issues (Could someone add more information about it?)

You are welcome to add your pdb's wishes below.
