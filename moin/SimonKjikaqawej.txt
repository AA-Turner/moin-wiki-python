== Programming Experience ==

I'm newbie programmer, and long-time Python user. I've tried programming before, but lacked a project that would hold my interest long enough, but I've found one now. Working on an IRC bot plugin, and I've spent the last 2 weeks learning everything I can :) . I used to do basic shell scripts to ease automation of my Linux-based machines, so the basic concepts aren't new to me.

== Personal ==

I'm a Mi'kmaq and Abenaki (look them up on Wikipedia) by decent.
