Links to Python information in Italian

/* XXX not all links checked - need to revisit and make sure */

The [[http://www.python.it|Italian Python Web site]]
is maintained by the Italian Python Association (Python Italia Associazione di Promozione Sociale). Its current webmaster is Manlio Perillo.  Very comprehensive, with much original material.

[[http://www.python-it.org|Python-it.org]] is a community-based website created by many Italian Python users ''for'' Python users. It contains a lot of resources: a forum, a community projects' page, a wiki, polls, a collection of Python news, a users' map and many others. Come visit us! ;)

A [[http://groups.google.com/group/it.comp.lang.python?lnk=gschg|usenet newsgroup, it.comp.lang.python]] gathers most of the Italian Pythonistas.

An [[http://it.diveintopython.org/|Italian version of Dive Into Python]] by Mark Pilgrim, lacking behind the English original but still useful.

[[http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html|One Day of IDLE Toying]] by Roberto Distefano.
