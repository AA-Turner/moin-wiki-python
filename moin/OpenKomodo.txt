The very feature-rich, multi-platform editor for scripting languages by ActiveState, Komodo Edit, was released as a zero-cost but closed-sourced application in November of 2007.

Komodo Edit is fully built out of this source tree:

  http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo

To try to help alleviate some confusion:

* OpenKomodo is the chosen name for Komodo-related things that have been open sourced -- all of which is in the svn.openkomodo.com repository.

* The http://www.openkomodo.com/ website is meant to provide details about open-source Komodo things.

* The major important "open-source Komodo thing" is the Komodo Edit editor.

* "Komodo Snapdragon" is/was an idea to do something with the open-sourced Komodo codebase other than a typical editor/IDE. The idea was to leverage Komodo's Mozilla underpinnings to do something "interesting" for web development. As a previous editor of this page indicated, Snapdragon is indeed current vaporware. Komodo Edit is not.
