The very feature-rich, multi-platform editor for script languages by ActiveState, Komodo Edit, was open-sourced in November 2007.
It is now freely available to everyone at no cost. ["Freely available to everyone at no cost" does not equal "Open Source". As far as I can see, Komodo Edit is crippled closed-source free-as-in-beer-only ad-ware for the high-cost closed-source non-free-in-every-way Komodo IDE - If I am wrong, please provide a link to where the source code for "Komodo Edit" is available. The current state of things Komodo seems to be quite confusing, but as far as I can tell "OpenKomodo" includes bits and pieces of "Komodo IDE" and "Komodo Edit" but is not in and of itself a usable product. OpenKomodo is instead the proposed base for future open-source products, the first of which will be "Komodo SnapDragon". However it doesn't look like "Komodo SnapDragon" will have Python as a focus, and it's unclear if it will have any support for Python at all. It also looks like "Komodo SnapDragon" is 100% vaporware at the moment.]
