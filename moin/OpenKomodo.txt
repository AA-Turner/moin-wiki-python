The very feature-rich, multi-platform editor for scripting languages by !ActiveState, Komodo Edit, was released as a zero-cost and open-sourced application in November of 2007.

http://www.openkomodo.com/

Komodo Edit is fully built out of this source tree:

http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo

To try to help alleviate some confusion:

 * OpenKomodo is the chosen name for Komodo-related things that have been open sourced -- all of which is in the svn.openkomodo.com repository.
 * The http://www.openkomodo.com/ website is meant to provide details about open-source Komodo things.
 * The primary open source Komodo IDE is the "Komodo Edit" editor.
