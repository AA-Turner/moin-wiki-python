The very feature-rich, multi-platform editor for script languages by ActiveState, Komodo Edit, was open-sourced in November 2007.
It is now freely available to everyone at no cost.

Komodo Edit is fully built out of this source tree:

  http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo

To try to help alleviate some confusion:
- OpenKomodo is the chosen name for Komodo-related things that have been open sourced -- all of which is in the svn.openkomodo.com repository.
- The http://www.openkomodo.com/ website is meant to provide details about open-source Komodo things.
- The major important "open-source Komodo thing" is the Komodo Edit editor.
- "Komodo Snapdragon" is/was an idea to do something with the open-sourced Komodo codebase other than a typical editor/IDE. The idea was to leverage Komodo's Mozilla underpinnings to do something "interesting" for web development. As a previous editor of this page indicated, Snapdragon is indeed current vaporware. Komodo Edit is not.
