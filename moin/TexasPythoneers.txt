All PyCon participants hailing from the Republic of Texas are invited to attend this short [[Birds of a Feather]] session in Kennedy Int'l Friday from 5:45pm - 6:30pm. We want to get as much feedback as possible to plan our next Texas Un-conference. We are tentatively planning to hold it in September in Austin. This will be a similar follow-on to last year's successful [[http://pycamp.python.org/Texas/HomePage|gathering in Houston]].
