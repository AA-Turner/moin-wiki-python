= Idea Repository =
IdeaRepository is an idea from #python.  Every once in a while, someone comes up with a really great idea, but has no time to actually do it.  That's what the repository is for.  If you have an idea, just tack it on to the end.

=== Ideas ===
 1. wiki:EfnetPythonWiki:PythiusProject could use some beta testers -- JÃ¼rgenHermann
 1. Super Ray Gun coded in python: someone implement this NOW please! (thirmite)
 1. A distributed, encrypted chat network. (skreech)
 1. a PeopleFilter --ShaeErisson
 1. A multi-player, online, NetHack style game (z3p, sorta working on it) (this might be possible in the future with TwistedReality. --ChrisArmstrong)

=== Done ===
 1. IdeaRepository: a place to put cool idea for programming projects.
