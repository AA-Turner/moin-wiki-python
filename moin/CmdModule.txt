The {{{cmd}}} module makes it easy to make command line interfaces in your programs.

{{{cmd}}} is differen than OptParse, in that OptParse is a tool for making command line tools.

{{{cmd}}}, on the other hand, makes it so you can embed a command line within your program.

= Command line advocacy =

In theses days of graphical user interface, a command line
interpreter can seems antique. I agree that GUI are often
more friendly (and in fact I'm happy to have something other
than "ed" to create this document). But a command
line interface can have several advantages:

  * '''portability''' almost any computer is able to drive a text terminal, so a command line interface can really run everywhere.

  * '''resources''' the CPU and memory cost of a command line interface is far lighter than a GUI library.

  * '''speed''' for advanced users, it's often faster to type a command than to dive into menus and windows.

  * '''development''' It is far faster to create a text oriented interface.

  * '''driving''' you can easily drive a text oriented program with the popen command. That mean that the whole application can be tested automatically.

And even if you plan to create a GUI software, it's often
good to start with a text interface. This will allow you
to focus on the applicative logic independently of the interface.
This is often a good way to create modular software.

= cmd module basics =

The module define only one class: the {{{Cmd}}} class. Creating
a command line interpreter is done by sub-classing the {{{cmd.Cmd}}}
class.

== Creating a command ==

The main goal of an interpreter is to respond to commands.
A command is the first part of a text line entered at the
interpreter prompt. This part is defined as the longer string
of characters contained in the {{{identchars}}}
member. By default {{{identchars}}} contain non accented letters,
digits and the underscore symbol. The end of the line is the
command parameters.

Commands handling is really easy: if you want to define the
command spam, you only have to define the {{{do_spam}}} method
in your derived class.

=== parameters ===

The {{{do_xxx}}} method should only take one extra parameter. This
parameter correspond to the part of the string entered by
the user after the command name. The {{{do_xxx}}} job is to parse
this string and to find the command parameters values. Python provide
many helpful tools to parse this string but this is quite out of the scope
of his how-to.

=== errors ===

The interpreter use the following format to signal errors:

{{{
*** <error description>: <additional parameters>
}}}

It's generally a good idea to use the same format for application
errors.

=== return value ===

In the most common case: commands shouldn't return a value.
The exception is when you want to exit the interpreter loop:
any command that return a true value stop the interpreter.

=== sample ===

The following function define a command which take two numerical
arguments and print the result of the addition.

{{{
def do_add(self,s): 
    l = s.split() 
    if len(l)!=2: 
       print "*** invalid number of arguments" 
       return 
    try: 
       l = [int(i) for i in l] 
    except ValueError: 
       print "*** arguments should be numbers" 
       return 
    print l[0]+l[1]
}}}

Now if you run the interpreter, you will have:

{{{
(Cmd) add 4 
*** invalid number of arguments 
(Cmd) add 5 4 
9
}}}

== Help ==

Help support is another strength of the cmd module. You can
provide documentation for the xxx command by defining the
{{{help_xxx}}} method. For the add command, you could for sample
define:

{{{
def help_add(self):
    print 'add two integral numbers'
}}}

And then, in the interactive interpreter you will have:

{{{
(Cmd) help add 

add two integral numbers
}}}

You can also define help for topics that are not related
to commands.

{{{
def help_introduction(self):
    print 'introduction'
    print 'a good place for a tutorial'
}}}

The interpreter understand the ? character as a shortcut
for the help command.

== Completion ==

Completion is a very interesting feature: when the user press
the TAB key, the interpreter will try to complete the command
or propose several alternatives. Completion will be available
only if the computer support the readline module. You can
also disable completion by passing the None value to the
completekey attribute of the Cmd class constructor.

The interpreter is able to process completion for commands
names, but for commands arguments you will have to help
it. For the command xxx, this is done by defining a {{{complete_xxx}}}
method. For sample, if you have defined a color command,
completion method for this command could be:

{{{
_AVAILABLE_COLORS = ('blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'red', 'black')

def complete_color(self, text, line, begidx, endidx):
    return [i for i in _AVAILABLE_COLORS if i.startswith(text)]

}}}

The {{{complete_xxx}}} method take four arguments:

   * '''text''' is the string we are matching against, all returned matches must begin with it
   * '''line''' is is the current input line
   * '''begidx''' is the beginning index in the line of the text being matched 
   * '''endidx''' is the end index in the line of the text being matched 

And should return a list (possibly empty) of strings
representing the possible completions. The arguments begidx
and endidx are useful when completion depend of the position
of the argument.

== Starting the interpreter ==

Once you have defined your own interpreter class, the only
thing to do is to create an instance and to call the mainloop
method:

{{{
interpreter = MyCmdInterpreter()
interpreter.mainloop()
}}}

In python 2.1 and 2.2 (and possibly some older releases too as well as future releases?) mainloop() has been renamed to cmdloop()


= Interface customization =

The cmd module provide several hooks to change the behavior
of the interpreter. You should notice that your users won't
necessary thanks you to deviate from the standard behavior.

== Empty lines ==

By default when an empty line is entered, the last command
is repeated. You can change this behavior by overriding
the {{{emptyline}}} method. For sample to disable the repetition
of the last command:

{{{
def emptyline(self):
    pass
}}}

== Help summary ==

When the help command is called without arguments, it print
a summary of all the documentation topics:

{{{
(Cmd) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
======================================== 
EOF add exit macro shell test 

Miscellaneous help topics:
========================== 
intro 

Undocumented commands: 
====================== 
line help  

(Cmd) 

}}}

This summary is separated in three parts:

  * '''documented commands''' are commands which have a {{{help_xxx}}} methods
  * '''miscellaneous help topics''' contain the {{{help_xxx}}} methods without {{{do_xxx}}} method
  * '''undocumented commands''' contain the {{{do_xxx}}} method without {{{help_xxx}}} method

You can customize this screen, with several data members:

  * {{{self.ruler}}} define the character used to underline section titles
  * {{{self.doc_header }}} define the title of the ''documented commands'' section
  * {{{self.misc_header }}} define the title of the ''miscalleanous help topics'' section
  * {{{self.undoc_header }}} define the title of the ''undocumented commands'' section

== Introduction message ==

At the startup, the interpreter print the {{{self.intro}}} string.
This string can be overridden via an optional argument to
the {{{cmdloop()}}} method. 

= Advanced material =

== Defaults handling ==

   * The {{{default}}} method can be overridden for handling commands for which there is no {{{do_xxx}}} method

   * The {{{completedefault}}} method may be overridden to intercept completion for commands that have no {{{complete_xxx}}} methods.

Theses methods have the same parameters than the {{{do_xxx}}} and
{{{complete_xxx}}} methods.

== Nested interpreters ==

If your program become complex, or if your data structure
is hierarchical, it can be interesting to define nested
interpreters (calling an interpreter inside an other interpreter).
In that case, I like having prompt like: 

{{{
(Cmd) test
(Cmd:Test) exit
(Cmd)
}}}

You can do this by changing the prompt attribute of the nested
interpreter:

{{{
def do_test(self, s):
    i = TestCmd()
    i.prompt = self.prompt[:-1]+':Test)'
    i.cmdloop()
}}}

Note that it can be a better practice to do this in the constructor
of the nested interpreter.

== Modal interaction ==

Sometime, it can be useful to have more directive interaction
sessions with the users. The Cmd class allow you to use
the {{{print}}} and {{{raw_input}}} functions without problems.

{{{
def do_hello(self, s):
    if s=='':
        s = raw_input('Your name please: ')
    print 'Hello',s

}}}

''FIXME: How to change completion behavior of raw_input?''

== The interpreter loop ==

At the start of the interpreter loop the preloop method is
called. At the end of the loop this is the postloop method.
This methods take no arguments and shouldn't return any
value. The following show how to make the interpreter more
polite:

{{{
class polite_cmd(cmd.Cmd,object): 
    def preloop(self): 
        print 'Hello' 
        super(polite_cmd,self).preloop() 

    def postloop(self): 
        print 'Goodbye'
        super(polite_cmd,self).postloop() 
}}}

== Command processing ==

When a command line is processed, several methods are called

    * {{{precmd}}} method is called with the a string corresponding to the line entered at the interpreter prompt as argument and should return a string which will be used as parameter by the onecmd method.


    * {{{onecmd}}} take the return value of precmd and return a boolean value (True will stop the interpreter). This is this method which do the real works: extracting the command, finding the corresponding do_xxx method and calling it.


    * {{{postcmd}}} this method take two parameters: the return value of the onecmd method and the string returned by precmd and should return a true value to exit the interpreter loop.

The precmd and postcmd methods do nothing by default and
was only intended as hook for derived class. In fact with 
the Python 2.2 super method, they are useless because anything
can be done by overriding the onecmd method. So you should probably
avoid to use this two hooks.

{{{
class dollar_cmd(cmd.Cmd, object):

    def onecmd(self, line):
        ''' define $ as a shortcut for the dollar command
            and ask for confirmation when the interpreter exit'''
        if line[:1] == '$':
            line = 'dollar '+line[1:]
        r = super (dollar_cmd, self).onecmd(line)
        if r:
            r = raw_input('really exit ?(y/n):')=='y'
        return r
}}}

But, if you want to simulate an interpreter entry you should
call this three methods in the good order. For sample if
you want to print the help message at startup:

{{{
interpreter = MyCmdInterpreter()
l = interpreter.precmd('help')
r = interpreter.onecmd(l)
r = interpreter.postcmd(r, l)
if not r:
    interpreter.mainloop()
}}}

This will prevent you from troubles if you want later to
inherit for a class which would have modified the hooks.

== Creating components ==

One other strength of the cmd module is that it handle multiple
inheritance. That mean that you can create helper class
intended to provide additional features.

=== Shell access ===

{{{
import os

class shell_cmd(cmd.Cmd,object): 

    def do_shell(self, s): 
        os.system(s) 

    def help_shell(self): 
        print "execute shell commands"
}}}

By deriving from this class, you will be able to execute
any shell command:

{{{
(Cmd) shell date 

Thu Sep 9 08:57:14 CEST 2002 

(Cmd) ! ls /usr/local/lib/python2.2/config 

Makefile Setup.config config.c install-sh makesetup Setup
Setup.local config.c.in libpython2.2.a python.o
}}}

By the way the cmd module understand the ! character as a
shortcut for the shell command.


=== Exit ===

{{{
class exit_cmd(cmd.Cmd,object): 

    def can_exit(self): 
        return True 

    def onecmd(self, line):
        r = super (exit_cmd, self).onecmd(line)
        if r and (self.can_exit() or 
           raw_input('exit anyway ? (yes/no):')=='yes'): 
             return True
        return False 

    def do_exit(self, s):
        return True

    def help_exit(self): 
        print "Exit the interpreter."
        print "You can also use the Ctrl-D shortcut." 

    do_EOF = do_exit 
    help_EOF= help_exit
}}}

This class provide the exit command to abort the interpreter.
You can protect exit by overriding the can_exit method.


=== Gluing all together ===
Now with a class that inherit both from {{{exit_cmd}}} and
{{{shell_cmd}}} you will be able to define an interpreter that
understand the shell and exit commands.

= Discussion =

It would be cool if you could call these mini-command lines from "the" command line.

If there were some sort of default OptParse-like behavior, that would totally rock.

That way, I could pass in instructions, scripts, and get back the results on stdout.

Something like "-c" for Python, where you can pass in a line, and get back the result, without seeing the intro text.
