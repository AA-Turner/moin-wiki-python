This extension of the `bdist_rpm` command shows how to modify the SPEC file before it is passed to the `RPM` shell command. It makes the Python version used to call "setup.py" known within the spec file, and also sets another prefix for the install step.

Note that you can use `pre_install` and `post_install` in your "setup.cfg" to add customized `%pre` and `%post` sections (those settings contain the names of files that are then appended to the SPEC file).
