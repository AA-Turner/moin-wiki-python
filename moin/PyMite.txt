PyMite is a flyweight Python interpreter written from scratch to execute on 8-bit microcontrollers.  It is a work-in-progress, but is developed enough to run demonstration programs.  Because PyMite runs on 8-bit architectures, one should not expect the interpreter to do everything its desktop counterpart can do.  However, it's capability is increasing daily.  Since PyMite is a re-implementation of Python, written in ANSI C, it also has a few new features: stackless from the start; fast, easy, native function support and a hybrid mark-sweep garbage collector.

PyMite is not yet available for public consumption.  The PyMite source will be posted to sourceforge in time for PyCon 2003.  PyMite currently compiles to a Linux desktop and cross compiles (using avr-gcc) to an Atmel atmega103.
