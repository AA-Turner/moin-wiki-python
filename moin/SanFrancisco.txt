Primary Contact Alvin Wang [MAILTO] alvinwang@gmail.com

Status I have contacted the San Mateo and Santa Clara Tourism and Convention Bureaus. They have distributed the RFP to over 100 hotels. I have received 2 responses. I expect 2-10 more. I will then drive around and collect pictures.

I have another volunteer that is checking with Fort Mason in San Francisco about space. I have my doubts that we will be able to find inexpensive hotel space above the dump level.

The bid webpages will be complete some time in early February.
