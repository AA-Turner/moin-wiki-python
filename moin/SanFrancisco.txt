=== Travel to Bay Area ===
There is not just 1 major airport.  There are 3 major airports in the SF Bay Area.  All the discount airlines fly here with direct flights to major urban centers.  SouthWest and JetBlue are starting service to San Francisco Airport this summer.

Airline Discounts - The conference organizers will negotiate a reduced fare from United Airlines and Southwest.  Since we are not a major conference, it will probably be 5%.  You can usually get that just by asking.

=== 24 Hour Nerding ===
We have all the conference rooms for all 4 days.  We can have evening events like sprints, additional ad hoc discussions, etc.

=== Speaker Benefits ===
One of the biggest advantages of the Bay Area is that we can get speakers that might not be willing  to travel for a Python convention but would be perfectly willing to drive.  For example, Ebay, Google, Amazon, Yahoo, etc have API's that can be used by Python.  They would be willing to drive but might be unwilling to fly.  

=== Outreach Opportunity ===
There will be additional meeting rooms available.  There are many interesting Python projects that could use some corporate support.  We can arrange presentations for companies of using your project.

=== Transit ===

=== If you have never been to the San Francisco Bay area ===

It is about 60 miles from San Francisco to San Jose.

San Jose and area is what is know as Silicon Valley.  All the tech you could possibly be interested in is here.  It would be simpler to list what is not here.

In San Francisco, there is World Class shopping, eating, tourist spots.   You should make reservations to go to Alcatraz because it often fills up.

Going South, there is Outlet Shopping in Gilroy, Monterey Aquarium, and many golf cities.  

North is the Napa Wine Country.  Home of OReilly Books.

The local organizers will provide tourism information and [http://www.mapbuilder.net/index.php customized maps] and details of the many local activities.

= Because it is Time =
2003-5 were in DC, 2006 - 2007 was in Dallas, 2008-9 should be on the West Coast.  It makes sense to move the convention around North America.
