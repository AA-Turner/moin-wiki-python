The weave package allows the inclusion of C/C++ within Python code. It is part of the larger SciPy package (http://www.scipy.org), but is also available as a stand alone package (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/weave.html) so that more people can try it out.

The GPL'd [[http://foss.eepatents.com/trac/AsynCluster/wiki|AsynCluster]] project contains a package ''svpmc'', which has a module [[http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/weave.py|svpmc.weave]]. The ''Weaver'' class in that module provides a convenient API for running C/C++ code with ''weave.inline''. See the  [[http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/sample.py|svpmc.sample]] module and its companion [[http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/sample.c|C code file]] for an example of usage.
