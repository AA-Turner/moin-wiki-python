The weave package allows the inclusion of C/C++ within Python code. It is part of the larger SciPy package (http://www.scipy.org), but is also available as a stand alone package (http://www.scipy.org/Weave) so that more people can try it out.

The GPL'd [http://foss.eepatents.com/trac/AsynCluster/wiki AsynCluster] project contains a package ''svpmc'', which has a module [http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/weave.py svpmc.weave]. The ''Weaver'' class in that module provides a convenient API for running C/C++ code with ''weave.inline''. See the  [http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/sample.py svpmc.sample] module and its companion [http://foss.tellectual.com/trac/AsynCluster/browser/projects/AsynCluster/trunk/svpmc/sample.c C code file] for an example of usage.
