=== Number Crunching and Related Tools ===

This page lists a number of packages related to numerics, number crunching, signal processing,
financial modeling, linear programming, statistics, data structures, date-time processing,
random number generation, and crypto.

==== Data Structures ====

  AVL module provide a hybrid between a dictionary and a list which
  can come in handy.  AVL trees (named after the inventors,
  Adel'son-Vel'skii and Landis) are balanced binary search trees.
  (Sam Rushing)

  * bplustree
  [http://www.pythonpros.com/arw/bplustree [details]]
  [http://www.pythonpros.com/arw/bplustree/bplustree.py.txt [source]]

  Classical compsci B+trees, implemented entirely in Python: Fast,
  portable file based indexing with range queries and including a
  dbm-compatibility mode.  (Aaron Watters)

  * fsm

  [http://musi-cal.mojam.com/~skip/python/fsm.py [source]]

  FiniteStateMachine module.  (Skip Montanaro)

  * graph_lib
  [http://www.ece.arizona.edu/~denny/python_nest/ [details]]
  [http://www.ece.arizona.edu/~denny/python_nest/graph_lib.py [source]]

  This module defines the Python class Graph.  Graph is loosely
  modelled after the Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms
  (LEDA).  It includes methods for constructing graphs, BFS and DFS
  traversals, topological sort, etc.

  * kjbuckets
  [http://www.pythonpros.com/arw/kjbuckets/ [details]]
  [http://www.pythonpros.com/arw/kjbuckets/kjb.tar.gz [source]]

  kjbuckets is a C extension to python which defines three Python data
  types kjSet, kjGraph, and kjDict, implemented using a fast and space
  efficient hash table strategy.  The types are tightly coupled and
  may be combined and manipulated using a collection of fast "set at a
  time" operations written in C.  If you need to manipulate
  collections and mappings quickly take a look at this module.  It
  comes with no warrantee of course, but it has been pounded pretty
  heavily and I consider it fairly solid.  (Aaron Watters)

  * npstruct
  [http://www.nightmare.com/software.html [details]]
  [ftp://squirl.nightmare.com/pub/python/python-ext/misc/npstruct.tar.gz [source]]

  An extension module useful for parsing and unparsing binary data
  structures. Somewhat like the standard struct module, but with a few
  extra features (bitfields, user-function-fields, byte order
  specification, etc...) and a different API more convenient for
  streamed and context-sensitive formats like network protocol
  packets, image and sound files, etc.  (Sam Rushing)

==== Date/Time ====


  * mxDateTime
  [http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html [details]]
  [http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/egenix-mx-base-2.0.2.tar.gz [source]]

  These types were created to provide a consistent way of transferring
  date and time data between Python and databases. Apart from handling
  date before the Unix epoch (1.1.1970) they also correctly work with
  dates beyond the Unix time limit (currently with Unix time values
  being encoded using 32bit integers, the limit is reached in 2038)
  and thus is Year 2000 and Year 2038 safe.  (M.-A. Lemburg)

  * Mayalib
  [http://www.pauahtun.org/ftp.html [details]]
  [FTP://www.pauahtun.org/pub/mayalib.zip [source]]

  Mayan dates and numbers (math) for Python.  (Ivan Van Laningham)

  * normalDate

  [http://starship.python.net/crew/jbauer/normalDate/normalDate.py [source]]

  NormalDate is a specialized class to handle dates without all the
  excess baggage (time zones, daylight savings, leap seconds, etc.) of
  other date structures.  (Jeff Bauer)

  [http://starship.python.net/~hochberg/ [details]]
  [http://starship.python.net/~hochberg/fourier.py [source]]

  A set of routines to perform Fourier transforms using pure
  (Numerical) Python. These are slower by a factor of 2-10 than pure C
  version in the FFT module (which is pretty good for a pure Python
  solution), but they make an interesting example.  (Tom Hochberg)

  simple interface to MATLAB's plotting functions. This allows you to, for
  example, plot NumPy arrays in a  MATLAB plot window.  (Andrew Sterian)


  * PYML
  [http://www.mathsource.com/cgi-bin/MathSource/Enhancements/Interfacing/Other/0209-292 [details]]
  [http://www.mathsource.com/MathSource/Enhancements/Interfacing/Other/0209-292/pyml.tar.gz [source]]

==== Matrix/Vector ====

  * matrix
  [http://www.nightmare.com/software.html [details]]
  [http://www.nightmare.com/squirl/python-ext/misc/matrix.py [source]]

  Yet Another Matrix Module. This one leans more toward the flexible
  end of the spectrum, sacrificing performance for correctness. For
  example, it can correctly handle rationals and other strange things
  being inserted into it. Also implemented: LU[P] decomposition, and a
  simultaneous linear equation solving capability. Most of the
  standard matrix ops: transpose, determinant, inverse, etc.. along
  with some functional-style methods for mapping and iteration.  (Sam
  Rushing)

  solving large systems of linear equations.  (Neil Schemenauer)

  * MatPy
  [http://MatPy.sourceforge.net [details]]
  [ftp://MatPy.sourceforge.net/pub/MatPy/ [source]]

  A Python package for numerical computation and plotting with a
  MatLab-like interface. It currently consists of wrappers around the
  Numeric, Gnuplot and SpecialFuncs packages. It provides an
  alternative interface to NumPy that is somewhat more convenient for
  matrix and vector computation. Eventually both will be based
  directly on the same low level routines. We are also looking for the
  possibility of interface to Octave.  (H. Zhu)

==== Music ====


  * ratio
  [http://www.execpc.com/~wsannis/ratio.html [details]]
  [http://www.execpc.com/~wsannis/ratio.py.txt [source]]

  For those who are big fans of Just Intonation, one tedious aspect of
  this is that you end up fondling ratios a lot. The math gets boring
  after a while, though I do believe you should be able to do the math
  on your own to get a feel for what it is you're doing.  Having said
  that, I decided I needed some help because I got sick of reducing
  multiplied ratios.  I've written a quick Python module, ratio.py,
  which handles a lot of the tedium. In particular, building up JI
  tetrachords and scales based on justly intuned chords or by
  katapyknosis is pretty simple with this module.  (William Annis)

  Recipes in C because I needed, at the time, actual source codes
  which I can examine instead of just wrappers around Fortran
  libraries like NumPy and Octave. As evident from the documentations,

  [http://www.ccraig.org/software [details]]
  [http://www.ccraig.org/software/ccrandom.py [source]]

  This module is mostly compatible with Python's random module, but
  uses Linux or BSD's /dev/urandom device to generate numbers, thus
  yielding more random output than the default Python module.
  (Christopher A. Craig)

  * crng  ((FIXME: both links broken))
  [http://www.sbc.su.se/~per/crng [details]]

  The Python module crng implements random-number generators (RNGs)
  based on several different algorithms producing uniform deviates in
  the open interval (0,1), i.e. exclusive of the end-point values 0
  and 1. A few continuous and integer-valued non-uniform deviates are
  also available. Each RNG algorithm is implemented as a separate
  Python extension type. The RNG types are independent of each other,
  but have very similar interfaces. The entire module is implemented
  as one single C source code file.  (Per J. Kraulis)
