SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on
standard [[Python]] and released under the GNU LGPL. 

It provides the modeller with components of a simulation model. These
include '''processes''', for active components like customers, messages, and vehicles, and '''resources''', for passive components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. It also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering statistics.

The current version is 2.1.0 (released on 03 June 2010).
