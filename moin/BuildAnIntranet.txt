''Just a rough sketch''

 1. choose applications: discussions, announcements, manage info, manage documents

 1. choose server: Like MSIIS WebProgramming

 1. choose database, SQL Server is a good choice

 1. generate content: Using Front Page works well, Python XML libraries, libraries to generate HTML

 1. generate navigation buttons: GraphicsAndImages 

 1. test: urllib, htmllib, xmlrpc

 1. use Python to automate deployment, testing, documentation

Well, the above looks like written by and for "Microsoft people".

A potentially more stable and definitely more ''free'' way to build an intranet is like that:

 1. choose applications: discussions, announcements, manage info, manage documents

 1. choose server and OS: Apache on Linux

 1. generate content: use a wiki engine like MoinMoin (it is like that thing you are looking at ''right now'')

 1. teach yourself and people to do it the WikiWay
