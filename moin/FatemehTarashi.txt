= About =

I'm Fatemeh Tarashi Kashani, I have a strong interest in programming, mathematics, especially Computational algebraic geometry, and Othello board games.

I became familiar with Python in 2012 and started programming with it. Since the following year, 2013, I have been actively involved in the Python Users Group in Tehran.
As I am involved in organizing and managing TehPUG sessions, if you are in Tehran or planning to visit Tehran and would like to join the TehPUG community, whether for giving a presentation or for a friendly conversation, feel free to email me, We can chat more and make necessary arrangements.:)
