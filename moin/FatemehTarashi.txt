## = About =

I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in mathematics and computational algebraic geometry. Additionally, I enjoy playing and analyzing Othello board games.

My journey with Python began in 2012, marking the start of an exciting programming adventure. By 2013, I became an active member of Tehran Python Users Group (TehPUG). In my role,I play a key role in organizing and managing TehPUG events.

If you're based in Tehran or planning a visit, and are interested in joining our python community, I'd be delighted to hear from you. Whether you're interested in making a presentation or simply wish to engage in friendly discussions, please don't hesitate to reach out via email. I'm always open to chatting and coordinating any necessary arrangements.
