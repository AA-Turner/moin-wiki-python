= About =

I'm Fatemeh Tarashi Kashani, but in the Python community, most people call me Fatemeh Tarashi. I have a strong interest in mathematics, especially algebraic geometry, programming particularly Python and Macaulay2, and board games like Othello.

I became familiar with Python in 2012 and started programming with it. Since the following year, 2013, I have been actively involved in the Python Users Group in Tehran. As I am involved in organizing and managing TehPUG sessions, if you are in Tehran or planning to visit Tehran and would like to join the TehPUG community, whether for giving a presentation or for a friendly conversation, feel free to email me, We can chat more and make necessary arrangements.:)
