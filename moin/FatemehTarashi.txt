==== About Me ====

I am a passionate python developer with a profound interest in mathematics and computational algebraic geometry. Additionally, I enjoy playing and analyzing Othello board games.

My Python journey embarked in 2012, heralding an exhilarating adventure in programming. By 2013, my engagement with the Tehran Python Users Group (TehPUG) deepened, where I now play a pivotal role in organizing and facilitating TehPUG events.
