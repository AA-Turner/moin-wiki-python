= The Melbourne Python Users Group =

The Melbourne Python Users Group normally meets on every first Monday of the month (except January). We are currently trialling a new venue: VLSCI Seminar Room, 700 Swanston Street, Carlton.

{{http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Melbourne+Central+Station&zoom=13&scale=false&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&format=png&visual_refresh=true&markers=size:mid%7Ccolor:0xff0000%7Clabel:1%7C700+Swanston+Street || align="right"}}


The Melbourne Python Users Group meetings are organised by the community itself. The current organisers include Ed Schofield and Juan Nunez-Iglesias. Other organisers past and perhaps present include Javier Candeira, Graeme Cross, Tennessee Leeuwenburg, and RichardJones.


== Next Meeting ==

'''Monday, 29 February 2016, 6:00pm''' at ''VLSCI Seminar Room, Ground Floor, 700 Swanton Street, Carlton''

Talks:

 * Juan Nunez-Iglesias: What's New in Python (February 2016 edition)
 * Nuwan Goonasekera: Python-Cloudbridge, "a simple cross-cloud Python library"

followed by pizza, drinks, and discussion!

If you would like to give a talk, please email [[mailto:jni.soma@gmail.com]], [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com]] or the mailing list.


== Mailing List ==

We also communicate about the meetings and about anything Python via our [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]].

Newcomers are always welcome to attend or write to the mailing list, we're a friendly bunch!

We have a policy about job offers on the mailing list:

 * As long as it's a Python-related job offer by the hiring company and not by an intermediary recruiter, you can just send it to the mailing list.

 * If it's not Python-related, or the poster of the job ad is a recruiter who won't mention the company that will be doing the hiring, please just use Seek or Monster, and don't write to the mailing list.

== Code of conduct ==

Though we are not affiliated with Linux Australia or Pycon AU, we've chosen to follow their [[https://github.com/linuxaustralia/constitution_and_policies/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md|Code of Conduct]] for our meetings. Not because we've ever had any problem in the past, but so that we know what to do if any problem should arise in the future.

== Meeting topics ==

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation, perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * Django, Flask, web2py, zope, web/CGI
 * Data analysis: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, ...
 * Science / engineering in Python
 * Visualization: 2D and 3D
 * PIL, pygame, pyopengl
 * PyQt, wxPython
 * pypi, distutils, virtualenv, venv, conda
 * PyPy, Cython, IronPython, Cpython internals, bytecode hacking
 * Databases, Unit Testing, Patterns
 * Devops, Cloud Computing
 * ... if you are interested in a particular topic, add it here!

"Platform as a Service" or PaaS is a popular buzz-word in Cloud Computing. But what does it mean, and how can you use it? OpenShift by Red Hat is a free-as-in-beer and soon to be free-as-in-speech PaaS platform that supports several open-source application server environments, including JavaEE6, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. This demo will show you how to sign up for OpenShift, install and use the command-line tools to create an application, and how to use git to download, modify, and upload your own WSGI and Python applications. You can use your WSGI framework of choice, including Django, Flask, and Bottle.

It's a rather novel algorithm that I (re)discovered(?)* for finding word matches when given a group of letters (eg. think of the puzzle in the age where you have a grid with 9 letters and have to find words). I then noticed that it had applications to other fields such as bioinformatics (which I won't go into in the talk [unless, of course, there is a particular interest]). It also has a very nice representation in Python - which I will mention.
