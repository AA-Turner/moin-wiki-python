The Melbourne Python Users Group

The Melbourne Python Users Group meets on every first Monday of the month (except January). Our current venue is Inspire 9, Level 1 41 Stewart St, Richmond.

We also communicate about the meetings and about anything Python via our [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]].

Newcomers are always welcome to attend or write to the mailing list, we're a friendly bunch!

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation, perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * Django, web2py, zope, web/CGI
 * PIL, pygame, pyopengl
 * wxPython, QT
 * pypi, distutils, virtualenv, venv
 * PyPy (not PyPI), IronPython, Cpython internals, bytecode hacking
 * Databases, Unit Testing, Patterns
 * Devops, Cloud Computing
 * ... if you are interested in a particular topic, add it here!

The Melbourne Python Users Group meetings are organised by the community itself. Ringleaders/Instigators are RichardJones, Ed Schofield, Tennesee Leeuwenburg, Graeme Cross and Javier Candeira.

"Platform as a Service" or PaaS is a popular buzz-word in Cloud Computing. But what does it mean, and how can you use it? OpenShift by Red Hat is a free-as-in-beer and soon to be free-as-in-speech PaaS platform that supports several open-source application server environments, including JavaEE6, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. This demo will show you how to sign up for OpenShift, install and use the command-line tools to create an application, and how to use git to download, modify, and upload your own WSGI and Python applications. You can use your WSGI framework of choice, including Django, Flask, and Bottle.

 * Martin Schweitzer "Primetime Wordfinding"... It's a rather novel algorithm that I (re)discovered(?)* for finding word matches when given a group of letters (eg. think of the puzzle in the age where you have a grid with 9 letters and have to find words). I then noticed that it had applications to other fields such as bioinformatics (which I won't go into in the talk [unless, of course, there is a particular interest]). It also has a very nice representation in Python - which I will mention.
 * Richard Jones ... a new cool thing I'm working on
