It's pretty close to the 96 and 112 tram, and only a short hop from
Parliament station. Not too sure about parking, but there's a fair bit
of street parking around, particularly after hours. There are also a
large number of cafes and restaurants along Brunswick street.

The meeting format is largely ad-hoc, and we're willing to experiment with different ideas, such as lightning presentations, announcements, demos or code/design reviews. If you have an idea, drop Anthony an email or bring it up for discussion, either on the list or at the meeting.

=== Potential Topics ===

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation,
perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like
to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular
area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * PIL
 * pygame
 * pyopengl
 * zope
 * pypi
 * distutils
 * wxPython
 * Twisted
 * web/CGI
 * Databases
 * Unit Testing
 * Patterns

If you feel qualified to give a talk/presentation on any of these, let me know and I'll schedule you in for a timeslot. Or just edit the wiki directly - that's what it's all about, after all :)
