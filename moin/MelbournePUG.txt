"Platform as a Service" or PaaS is a popular buzz-word in Cloud Computing. But what does it mean, and how can you use it? [[OpenShift|OpenShift]] by Red Hat is a free-as-in-beer and soon to be free-as-in-speech PaaS platform that supports several open-source application server environments, including JavaEE6, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. This demo will show you how to sign up for [[OpenShift|OpenShift]], install and use the command-line tools to create an application, and how to use git to download, modify, and upload your own WSGI and Python applications. You can use your WSGI framework of choice, including Django, Flask, and Bottle.

 * Martin Schweitzer "Primetime Wordfinding"... It's a rather novel algorithm that I (re)discovered(?)* for finding word matches when given a group of letters (eg. think of the puzzle in the age where you have a grid with 9 letters and have to find words). I then noticed that it had applications to other fields such as bioinformatics (which I won't go into in the talk [unless, of course, there is a particular interest]). It also has a very nice representation in Python - which I will mention.
 * Richard Jones ... a new cool thing I'm working on
 * Chris Miles "Intro to [[http://www.psychofx.com/psi/|PSI]] (Python System Information)"
