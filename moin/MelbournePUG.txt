== Mailing List ==
We also communicate about the meetings and about anything Python via our [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]].

Newcomers are always welcome to attend or write to the mailing list, we're a friendly bunch!

We have a policy about job offers on the mailing list:

 * As long as it's a Python-related job offer by the hiring company and not by an intermediary recruiter, you can just send it to the mailing list.

 * If it's not Python-related, or the poster of the job ad is a recruiter who won't mention the company that will be doing the hiring, please just use Seek or Monster, and don't write to the mailing list.

== Code of conduct ==
Though we are not affiliated with Linux Australia or Pycon AU, we've chosen to follow their [[https://github.com/linuxaustralia/constitution_and_policies/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md|Code of Conduct]] for our meetings. Not because we've ever had any problem in the past, but so that we know what to do if any problem should arise in the future.

== Meeting topics ==
If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation, perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * Django, Flask, Mezzanine, other web tools
 * Data analysis: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, ...
 * Science / engineering in Python
 * Databases, unit testing, design patterns

'''Monday 2018-09-03, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===

'''1. Peter Degorski: Weather, Energy, and Python''' (~30 minutes)

"Energy Analytics is a new industry which Victoria is well positioned to lead in. Python is one of the wonderful tools that are adaptable enough to keep up with the enormous fast paced change. Pvlib-python and windpowerlib are great open source python tools used to model and study utility scale modules and wind turbines. Both are highly customisable. These two renewable energy modelling packages can run stand-alone and with some effort can be adapted to run on historical weather datasets. Doing this can help with the analysis of correlations in the wind/solar generation portfolio of Victoria. Python was the perfect package for this type of project; in my case it was used end to end; from downloading of the data to data modelling, analysis and ultimately visualisation."

'''2. Ed Schofield: Handling physical quantities and units with Python''' (~15 minutes)

Following on from Peter's talk, Ed will give an overview of the why and how of Python tools to handle units easily for scientific and engineering-heavy fields.

'''Monday 2018-08-06, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===

'''1. Damien George, Nick Moore, Matt Trentini: A Taste of !MicroPython''' (~30 minutes)

Python can be used for a vast range of tasks like web development, data science and machine learning. With !MicroPython, embedded development can now be added to the domains in which Python excels.

Come along and listen to the creator of !MicroPython - and two converts! - explain why the language was created and how it manages to run on resource-constrained microcontrollers. Demonstrations will showcase effective applications for the language and explain why !MicroPython is compelling in the embedded space. 

Note: There will be time, during or after pizza, to ask questions and tinker with some hardware. Bring a laptop if you'd like to play with a microcontroller!

'''2. Rory Hart: The future of Python dependency management''' (~25 minutes)

Pipenv is now the recommended tool for application dependency management. Rory will talk through what problems Pipenv solves and introduce its usage through a live demonstration.


'''Monday 2018-07-02, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===


'''1. Rory Hart: Just enough OpenID Connect''' (~25 minutes) - rescheduled from June

Many of us encounter authentication protocols as a side effect of just trying to get things done. The simple task of accessing data from a client API or integrating with a third parties balloons out into a yak shaving session filled with obtuse authentication failure messages. Rory will walk through a number of scenarios involving OpenID Connect and offer practical guidance on productively
using Python to work with OpenID Connect.


'''2. Ed Schofield: Pandas - under the fur''' (~20 minutes)

Ed will talk about advanced topics in Pandas such as:

 * performance: what operations are slow and what to do about it
 * internals: views and copies, chained indexing
 * avoiding gotchas with data types

and the design decisions behind Pandas 2.


'''Monday 2018-06-04, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===

'''2. Michael Teasdale: Real-world case studies with Python-based web businesses''' (~20 minutes)

Michael has founded or worked for around a dozen e-commerce and logistics companies in Australia and Asia-Pacific that base their operations entirely on Python. He will describe some amazing success stories of Python adoption in automating various business processes. He will also describe workflow tools for ensuring sites are tested, robust, and production-ready in a short period of time.

'''3. Ed Schofield: Interactive visualisation with Altair''' (~20 minutes)

'''Monday 2018-05-07, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===

'''1. Graeme Cross: From "Glue it" to "Ship it" ''' (~25 minutes)

Python is an excellent language for rapidly prototyping ideas, and is very well suited to gluing together different tools, libraries and frameworks into a cohesive prototype. However this doesn't always map well into a robust production code base for an application that is shipped out to paying customers.

This presentation will cover a checklist of considerations to factor into your project before you dive into your prototype to help make life easier, budgets lower, schedules shorter, lawyers poorer and customers happier when your well-received prototype then has to be shipped.

'''2. Mike Dewhirst: Chemical database scraping via Django Admin''' (20 minutes)

This is a beginner- to intermediate-level walk-through of a real-world project that uses Django and specifically its Admin interface.

The Django Admin was originally billed as being "production ready" code but this was watered down in the Django docs a couple of years ago. Mike's SharedSDS project is in production and he will explain in this talk why he thinks the Admin is magnificent.

'''3. Ed Schofield: What's New in Python''' (15 minutes)

Ed will give a brief run-down of new developments in the Python ecosystem in recent months.


'''Monday 2018-03-05, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

=== Talks: ===

'''1. Fred Rotbart: Hierarchical Temporal Memory in Python: part 2''' (30-45 minutes)

Fred will give a refresher (for those who missed his talk in February) and then pick up where he left off last time, with various fancy demos of what's possible with Hierarchical Temporal Memory for learning patterns powerfully from small(ish) datasets.

'''2. Adel Fazel: Web data wrangling for beginners''' (20 minutes)

Adel will give an introductory talk about using Python for data wrangling, accessing web APIs, parsing JSON data, and manipulating it with Pandas. He will demonstrate this by accessing the New York Times API.

'''3. Ed Schofield: !AlphaZero - background, how it works, and a general Python implementation''' (20 minutes)

!AlphaZero is a major recent advance in self-play-based reinforcement learning from !DeepMind that can learn complex 2-player strategy games like Go and Chess from scratch (with no human knowledge) and quickly surpass human capabilities. Ed will review the algorithm, how it works, what its future applications could be, and a general-purpose Python package for implementing it.

=== Talks: ===


'''1. Robert Lechte: "Your database migrations are bad." ''' (25-30 minutes)

It's really hard to work with database schemas. But schemas are actually good. The trouble is that people get frustrated with the tooling. Existing migration tools (alembig, django migrations etc.) all make it far too hard. Every change is a chore when you have to worry about version numbers and migration files each time. It's tedious, manual, error-prone, and hard to test.

Fortunately, we can do better! Using Python and PostgreSQL, we'll discuss a radically different approach to managing schema migrations, using new tools and workflows to make it much faster, mostly automatic, fully testable, and more reliable."

Bio: Robert created the data warehousing for New Zealand's supercomputing infrastructure, then worked for the Digital Transformation Agency in Sydney. He has been writing Python tools to make working with databases more pleasant.


'''2. Fred Rotbart: Highlights from PyCon Israel 2017''' (15 minutes)

Python wasn't particularly popular in Israel until recently but has exploded in popularity in the last 1-2 years. Fred attended PyCon Israel this year and was surprised at how large the community there is now. He will talk about the event, Python uptake in general, and give highlights from the event.


'''3. Ed Schofield: publishing with Python''' (25-30 minutes)

Python has long had Sphinx for generating high-quality technical documentation from reStructuredText (ReST). Many projects have more recently adopted one of many flavours of Markdown as a simple, flexible format, while Jupyter notebooks have taken the Python world by storm. This talk will give an overview of the impressive set of tools in R for publishing (knitr, Rmarkdown) and compare what the Python ecosystem has to offer.


'''Monday 2017-10-02, 5:45pm for 6:00pm''', at Outcome-Hub Co-Working Space, Suite 1, 121 Cardigan Street Carlton

Talks:
1. Renaldi Gondosubroto: "Moving Ahead with Internet of Things Developments in Python"

Abstract:

"In this talk, I will discuss how the Internet of Things is applied in Python at the moment and how it has progressed so far. This will be complemented by examples through some of my own experiences in projects involving the concept. One example of the practice that I will show is its use is through libraries created via TCP / IP connections to generate data collected from devices placed in other locations - and in this practice - measure environmental parameters in the environment through the Raspberry Pi. From here I will also discuss how other third party IoT services such as Amazon Web Services or ThingSpeak can also connect and manage smart devices from there, utilizing the MQTT protocol. Next I will talk more about how this is very useful from the point of view of consumers, and how the methodology of its use can be developed with code architecture in Python. After that, I will discuss the future of this IoT concept for Python, how I see this concept will grow on this platform, and future developments that can still be done at this time."

"Platform as a Service" or PaaS is a popular buzz-word in Cloud Computing. But what does it mean, and how can you use it? OpenShift by Red Hat is a free-as-in-beer and soon to be free-as-in-speech PaaS platform that supports several open-source application server environments, including JavaEE6, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. This demo will show you how to sign up for OpenShift, install and use the command-line tools to create an application, and how to use git to download, modify, and upload your own WSGI and Python applications. You can use your WSGI framework of choice, including Django, Flask, and Bottle.

 * Martin Schweitzer "Primetime Wordfinding"... It's a rather novel algorithm that I (re)discovered(?)* for finding word matches when given a group of letters (eg. think of the puzzle in the age where you have a grid with 9 letters and have to find words). I then noticed that it had applications to other fields such as bioinformatics (which I won't go into in the talk [unless, of course, there is a particular interest]). It also has a very nice representation in Python - which I will mention.
 * Richard Jones ... a new cool thing I'm working on
 * Chris Miles "Intro to [[http://www.psychofx.com/psi/|PSI]] (Python System Information)"
