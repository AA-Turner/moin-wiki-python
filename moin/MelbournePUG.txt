== The Melbourne Python Users Group ==

The Melbourne Python Users Group is currently mostly active via its [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]].

A Facebook group has also been set up to facilitate interactions between MPUGgers, should they prefer that medium. (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=59918958226)

The main culprits are [[mailto:r1chardj0n3s@gmail.com|Richard Jones]] and [[mailto:tleeuwenburg@gmail.com|Tennessee Leeuwenburg]], along with a number of other Pythoneers.


=== Meeting Details, Location, etc. ===

We're looking for a good venue where we can have presentations, drink and perhaps eat somewhere in the CBD. The Redback Hotel has been mentioned but it's out of the CBD which isn't friendly to people coming in from the wilds.


=== Schedule ===

We meet on the second Tuesday of every even month.

The next meeting will be Tuesday the 11th of August:

 * Richard Jones will present "Adventures in IronPython"
 * The venue is still to be determined but will be in or very near the CBD


=== Potential Topics ===

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation,
perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like
to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular
area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * PIL
 * pygame
 * pyopengl
 * zope
 * pypi
 * distutils
 * wxPython
 * Twisted
 * web/CGI
 * Databases
 * Unit Testing
 * Patterns

If you feel qualified to give a talk/presentation on any of these, let me know and I'll schedule you in for a timeslot. Or just edit the wiki directly - that's what it's all about, after all :)
