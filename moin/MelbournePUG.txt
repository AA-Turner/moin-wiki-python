== The Melbourne Python Users Group ==

The Melbourne Python Users Group is currently mostly active via its [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]].

A Facebook group has also been set up to facilitate interactions between MPUGgers, should they prefer that medium. (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=59918958226)

The main culprits are [[mailto:r1chardj0n3s@gmail.com|Richard Jones]] and [[mailto:tleeuwenburg@gmail.com|Tennessee Leeuwenburg]], along with a number of other Pythoneers.

We meet on the second Tuesday of every month starting at 6:30pm.

'''Tuesday the 11th of August'''

 * Richard Jones "Adventures in IronPython"
 * Chris Miles "Intro to [[http://www.psychofx.com/psi/|PSI]] (Python System Information)"
 * Add your presentation here!

=== Potential Topics ===

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation,
perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like
to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular
area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * PIL
 * pygame
 * pyopengl
 * zope
 * pypi
 * distutils
 * wxPython
 * Twisted
 * web/CGI
 * Databases
 * Unit Testing
 * Patterns

If you feel qualified to give a talk/presentation on any of these, let me know and I'll schedule you in for a timeslot. Or just edit the wiki directly - that's what it's all about, after all :)
