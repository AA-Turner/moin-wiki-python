== The Melbourne Python Users Group ==

The Melbourne Python Users Group currently meets on the 3rd Thursday of each month at Intrepid Travel in Fitzroy. New members and presenters are always welcome.

The main culprit is [mailto:anthony.briggs@gmail.com Anthony Briggs], along with a number of high caliber/hard core pythonistas. We also have a [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug mailing list].

=== Meeting Details, Location, etc. ===

The next meeting is on August the 18th at 6.30pm, and we'll have two presentations - one on test driven development by Bruce Cropley and another from Richard Jones on pygame.

It's pretty close to the 96 and 112 tram, and only a short hop from
Parliament station. Not too sure about parking, but there's a fair bit
of street parking around, particularly after hours. There are also a
large number of cafes and restaurants along Brunswick street.

The meeting format is largely ad-hoc, and we're willing to experiment with different ideas, such as lightning presentations, announcements, demos or code/design reviews. If you have an idea, drop Anthony an email or bring it up for discussion, either on the list or at the meeting.
