== The Melbourne Python Users Group ==

{{http://mechanicalcat.net/images/mpug-map.png|map to the meeting|align="right"}}

The Melbourne Python Users Group is currently mostly active via its [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/melbourne-pug|mailing list]]. Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch :)

A Facebook group has also been set up to facilitate interactions between MPUGgers, should they prefer that medium. (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=59918958226)

The main culprits are [[mailto:r1chardj0n3s@gmail.com|Richard Jones]], [[mailto:tleeuwenburg@gmail.com|Tennessee Leeuwenburg]] and [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]], along with a number of other Pythoneers.

Short URL: http://j.mp/mpug (or http://bit.ly/mpug - n.b. not 'MPUG')

We've also got a [[http://mechanicalcat.net/images/MPUG-flyer.pdf|PDF flyer]] that you can post on message boards.

=== Meeting Details, Location, etc. ===

Meetings are held at RMIT University, 12.07.02 (building 12, level 07, room 02). It's close to the corner of Swanston and Franklin Streets. We typically head over the road afterwards for dinner, drinks and conversations.

=== Schedule ===

We meet on the first Monday of every month starting at 6pm.

'''Monday 1st August'''

'''5 minute talks'''

 * the awesome PyCon AU schedule!
 * Graeme Cross: 5 useful resources for Python beginners (my PyCon AU lightning talk)

'''15 minute talks'''

 * Richard Jones: web micro framework battle preview (probably more like 30 minutes)


=== Potential Topics ===

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation,
perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like
to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular
area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * PIL
 * pygame
 * pyopengl
 * zope
 * pypi
 * distutils
 * wxPython
 * Twisted
 * web/CGI
 * Databases
 * Unit Testing
 * Patterns
 * web2py

If you feel qualified to give a talk/presentation on any of these, let me know and I'll schedule you in for a timeslot. Or just edit the wiki directly - that's what it's all about, after all :)

'''Tuesday the 11th of August'''

 * Martin Schweitzer "Primetime Wordfinding"... It's a rather novel algorithm that I (re)discovered(?)* for finding word matches when given a group of letters (eg. think of the puzzle in the age where you have a grid with 9 letters and have to find words).  I then noticed that it had applications to other fields such as bioinformatics (which I won't go into in the talk [unless, of course, there is a particular interest]).  It also has a very nice representation in Python - which I will mention.
 * Richard Jones ... a new cool thing I'm working on
 * Chris Miles "Intro to [[http://www.psychofx.com/psi/|PSI]] (Python System Information)"
