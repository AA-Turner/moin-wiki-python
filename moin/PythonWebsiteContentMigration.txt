'''Note:''' These are older notes on content migration from the old site.  Since some of the old site is still in the old format and copied over automatically by the build process, this is being retained in case there is something useful in it.

= A quick guide to how a link should converted on the new website =

First an example.

Old Style: ../Mirrors.html

New Style: /doc/mirrors/

What would have been a single page in the old site is now a directory named after the old page (without '.html') containing index.html.

In the source repository, the page is made up of several files that contain template information, content and maybe some sub-menu stuff and this is all whacked together by Pyramid to produce the new site. But you should know that already if you are editing links in pages.. :-)

A link on a page like '<a href="../Mirrors.html">Blah</a>' should be converted so that:

a) The link is lowercase (because the directory that the page content is in will be

b) The suffix should be removed if it is .html, not if it is .pdf or .rst

c) Preferably the relative portion should be replaced with an abolute path. If the page is moved within the website, the links on the page will not require maintenance.


= Files/Directories that need to be copied over into the new python tree =

not checking the /<N> or /doc/<N> folders yet

== script needed ==

/channews.rdf
/channews.dat
^^^ rdf to be moved from /new/rdf/index.html and header replaced with xml directive .. what about .dat

/dev/summary/channews.rdf
/dev/summary/channews.dat
^^^ needs generating? do the summaries still get generated still?

== files/directories to be copied into www ==

NO   /community    already moved
NO   /consortium   points to psf
NO   /cp4e         omitting
YES  /css          will be need for some legacy content
YES  /buildbot     
YES  /ftp

YES  /idle      should this page have a warning that it may be removed or pointed elsewhere
YES  /emacs     should this page have a warning that it may be removed or pointed elsewhere
YES  /editors     should this page have a warning that it may be removed or pointed elsewhere

YES?  /neal    pictures of guido and python, should we move? (also has a patches subdir)

YES?  /other   spread & python movie... should these be here.. can we move them into files?

???   /packages?

NO?    /packman   - short term copy (this is apparently no longer being maintained according to email from owner/ex-maintainer)

???    /patches

YES    /pics  - all of the old assets

??/    /psa

YES /pycon/dc2003 - copy to /community/pycon/dc2003
YES /pycon/dc2004 - ditto
??? /pycon/dc2005
??? /pycon/2006

NO?   /psf   I'm fairly sure everything was converted to the new site already during the sprint (?)

YES    /pythonlabs

???    /scripts  this shouldn't really be in the publicly available web tree?

YES   /search/hypermail  - important historical archives

YES   /pyvault  - note sure of status (no email reply from maintainer) but copy for now


== redirects needed ==

above and beyond the checks for ./<mixedcase>.html which should redirect to ./<lowercase> the following will be needed

/<n> (python versions) -> /download/releases/<n>

/consortium  >  /psf
/dev/devintro.html > /dev/devintro

smb://192.168.0.2/python/www.python.org/download/download_linux.html
smb://192.168.0.2/python/www.python.org/download/download_mac.html
smb://192.168.0.2/python/www.python.org/download/download_os2.html
smb://192.168.0.2/python/www.python.org/download/download_other.html

smb://192.168.0.2/python/www.python.org/download/download_windows.html
^^^ Do we need all of these? they should be copied over for legacy?

/pycon -> /community/pycon 


/security -> /news/security

/sigs -> /community/sigs  (check for individual sig redirects?)

/why -> /about/why

/sf/######## -> source forge bug/patch lookup

/Jobs.html -> /community/jobs
/Help.html -> /help
/News.html -> /news
/security -> /news/security

/topics(.*) -> /doc/topics(.*)
/psf(.*) -> /community/psf(.*)

/audio -> http://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio

== action taken on directories ==

/dev/buildbot
^^^   what is going to happen and where does this come from

/dev/doc/devel
/dev/doc/maint
/dev/doc/maint23
/dev/doc/maint24
/dev/doc/newstyle

/dev/doc/python-docs-maint23.tar.bz2
/dev/doc/python-docs-maint24.tar.bz2
/dev/doc/python-docs-newstyle.tar.bz2

^^^ all of above need addressing (probably just copying in?

/dev/src
^^^ looks like it just needs copying in?


/doc/essays
^^^ looks like it could be copied over??? it might need a new style index page though to make it fit in better?


/doc/<n> (python versions)
^^^ Copy over

/doc/api
/doc/current

/doc/ext
/doc/inst
/doc/lib
/doc/mac

/download/contrib-categories
/download/contrib-entries
/download/contrib-master.py
/download/contrib-master.txt
^^^ are these doing something clever?

/download/SendingBinaries.html
^^^ should this be in the main menu?


/editors/editors/Python.CLF
^^^ don't know what this is




/topics/writing
^^^ I can't see any inbound links to this page?

/windows
