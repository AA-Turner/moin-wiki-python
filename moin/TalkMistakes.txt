 * Bad spelling
 * Projectors don't work
 * Talking to the walls
 * Mumbling
 * Speaking quietly
 * Speaking with monotone voice
 * Small text
 * Broken python code
 * Typing slowly
 * Deleting demo sourcecode while presenting

 * Avoiding questions
 * Not knowing subject
 * Slamming doors (audience mistake)

However, these are some of the positive things experienced by talkers at EuroPython2004:

 * Repeating questions
 * Using pygame for demonstrations - making it fun
 * Not relying on projector
 * Speaking to audience
 * Smiling
 * Interesting
 * Audio/visual help from audience
 * Colorhighlighting code
 * Readable slides, using illustrations instead of large amounts of text
 * Live demo
 * Staying on topic
 * Introduce with "Who is this talk for"
 * Introduce with context/overview of talk
 * Publishing talk material to the Wiki
