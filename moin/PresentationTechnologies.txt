== Presentation Styles ==

There are several different styles of presentation technology employed in the various Web application frameworks (see WebProgramming).

 * PythonInWebPage
 * StructureAnnotation
 * ["Programmatic"]

=== Syntax ===

In the area of syntax, several different design decisions are made alongside the above classifications, and this is often the principal reason that new template systems get invented:

 * ElementBasedSyntax
 * CommentBasedSyntax
 * AttributeBasedSyntax

=== Examples ===

Some presentation systems fall neatly into the categories above. Others are less easy to classify but have a closer association to one category than the others.

==== PythonInWebPage ====

 * CheeTah
 * PSP (from WebWare)
 * ["Spyce"]

==== StructureAnnotation ====

 * ZPT (Zope Page Templates - see ["Zope"])
 * DTML (Document Template Markup Language - see ["Zope"])
 * ClearSilver
 * wt (see JonsPythonModules)
 * PyMeld

==== Hybrids ====

 * CHTL and CGTL (from CherryPy)

==== Programmatic ====

 * PTL (from ["Quixote"])

=== Note ===

Feel free to add more abstract descriptions and more examples to help people decide what they are looking for!
