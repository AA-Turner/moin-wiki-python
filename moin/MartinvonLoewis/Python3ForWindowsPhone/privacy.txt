This interactive Python interpreter supports connections to the internet using the socket module. Data is transmitted to the internet only if if this socket module is used (either directly, or indirectly e.g. through the urllib module). On its own, this app will not attempt to collect personal information.

The built-in access to SkyDrive is only used to download and run Python into the interpreter, and only on user request.
