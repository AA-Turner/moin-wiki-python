This page lists tools for Java/Python interoperatbility.



[http://jepp.sourceforge.net/ Jepp] embeds CPython in Java. It is safe to use in a heavily threaded environment, it is quite fast and its stability is a main feature and goal.

[http://jpe.sourceforge.net/ JPE] (Java-Python Extension) uses JNI to provide a bridging mechanism between Java and a Python interpreter (including use of C extensions for Python). Active development ceased in mid 2002. 

'''JPI''' was a two-way Python-Java Interface. It is no longer being developed.

[http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html Jython] is a Python-to-Java bytecode compiler.  It is written in Java.  (Formerly known as JPython.)

[http://jpype.sourceforge.net/ JPype] is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class libraries. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native level in both Virtual Machines.
