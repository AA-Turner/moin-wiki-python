= Tools for scripting Java using Python =

This page lists tools for Java/Python interoperatbility.



[http://jepp.sourceforge.net/ Jepp] embeds CPython in Java. It is safe to use in a heavily threaded environment, it is quite fast and its stability is a main feature and goal. As of November 2006, the project is active. 

[http://jpe.sourceforge.net/ JPE] (Java-Python Extension) uses JNI to provide a bridging mechanism between Java and a Python interpreter (including use of C extensions for Python). Active development ceased in mid 2002. 

'''JPI''' was a two-way Python-Java Interface. It is no longer being developed.

[http://jpype.sourceforge.net/ JPype] is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class libraries. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native level in both Virtual Machines.


[http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html Jython] (formerly: JPython) is a Python-to-Java bytecode compiler.  It is written in Java. Most Python scripts should run with little or no modification on Jython. 
The exception is scripts that use Python extensions written in C. Some modules in the standard library may not be available in Jython.

As of November 2006, Jython is currently at Python version 2.1 and the project is inactive.
