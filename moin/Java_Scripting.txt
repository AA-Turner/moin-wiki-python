= Tools for scripting Java using Python =

This page lists tools for Java/Python interoperatbility.

Project status is categorized as '''active''' (alive and kicking), '''inactive''' (sleeping, but alive), or '''discontinued''' (dead, no longer supported).


----------

== Active Projects ==

[http://jepp.sourceforge.net/ Jepp] embeds CPython in Java. It is safe to use in a heavily threaded environment, it is quite fast and its stability is a main feature and goal.

 * '''Project Status''' as of November 2006 is '''active'''. 

----------

== Inactive Projects ==

[http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html Jython] (formerly: JPython) is a Python-to-Java bytecode compiler.  It is written in Java. Most Python scripts should run with little or no modification on Jython. 
The exception is scripts that use Python extensions written in C.  Some modules in the standard library may not be available in Jython.

 * '''Project Status''' as of November 2006 is '''inactive''', with Jython at Python version 2.1.

[http://jpype.sourceforge.net/ JPype] is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class libraries. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native level in both Virtual Machines. JPype is currently at version 0.5, with version 0.6 in the works.  
 * '''Project Status''' as of November 2006 is '''inactive'''.  For information on the current status of the project, see the [http://jpype.blogspot.com/ JPype Blog]


----------

== Discontinued Projects ==

[http://jpe.sourceforge.net/ JPE] (Java-Python Extension) uses JNI to provide a bridging mechanism between Java and a Python interpreter (including use of C extensions for Python). 
 * '''Project Status''' as of 2002 is '''discontinued'''. 
 
[http://www.ndim.edrc.cmu.edu/dougc/jpi/Home.html JPI] was a two-way Python-Java Interface.
 * '''Project Status''' as of 2002 is '''discontinued'''.
