People often use the term strongly-typed language to refer to a language that is both statically typed (types are associated with a variable declaration) and strongly-typed (restrictive about how types can be intermingled).  So, if you look at dynamic typing and strong-typing as orthogonal concepts, Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed.

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language Strongly Typed Programming Language] for more details.
