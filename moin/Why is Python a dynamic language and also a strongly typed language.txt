 Answer::
  * People often use the term strongly-typed language to refer to a language that is both statically typed (types are associated with a variable declaration -- or, more generally, the compiler can tell which type a variable refers to, for example through type inference, without executing the program) and strongly-typed (restrictive about how types can be intermingled).  So, if you look at dynamic typing and strong-typing as orthogonal concepts, Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed.
