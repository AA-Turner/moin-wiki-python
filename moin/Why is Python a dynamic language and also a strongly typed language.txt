 Answer::
  * People often use the term strongly-typed language to refer to a language that is both statically typed (types are associated with a variable declaration -- or, more generally, the compiler can tell which type a variable refers to, for example through type inference, without executing the program) and strongly-typed (restrictive about how types can be intermingled).  So, if you look at dynamic typing and strong-typing as orthogonal concepts, Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed.

Another answer:
 * Python is strongly typed as the interperter keeps track of all variables types. It's also very dynamic as it rarely uses what it knows to limit variable usage. In Python, it's the program's responsibility to use built-in functions like isinstance() and issubclass() to test variable types and correct usage. Python tries to stay out of your way while giving you all you need to implement strong type checking.
