List of tests that are failing in the py3k-struni branch.

Protocol:

  * if you start working on a test, to avoid duplicate work,
    add your name+email+date to the bulleted item for the test below,
    with the text "FIXING" or "INVESTIGATING"
  * if you figure out why a test is failing,
    just add a note (name etc. is still appreciated)
  * if you fix a test, and you check in the fix,
    add a note "FIXED" (occasionally we'll clean these up)
  * if you don't have checkin permissions, use the SF patch manager
    and note the patch number here (perhaps in the form of a link
    to python.org/sf/NNNNN)
