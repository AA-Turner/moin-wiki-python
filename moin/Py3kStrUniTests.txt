= List of tests that are failing in the py3k-struni branch =

(Back to ["Python3000"].)

Protocol:

  * if you start working on a test, to avoid duplicate work, add your name+email+date to the bulleted item for the test below, with the text "MINE"
  * if you figure out why a test is failing, just add a note (name etc. is still appreciated)
  * if you fix a test, and you check in the fix, add a note "FIXED" (occasionally we'll clean these up)
  * if you don't have checkin permissions, use the SF patch manager and note the patch number here (perhaps in the form of a link to python.org/sf/NNNNN), and add a note "FIXED IN SF" (plus name etc.)

== How to run tests ==

Assume you've got the py3k-struni branch checked out.
{{{
./configure
make
./python Lib/test/regrtest.py test_foobar  # runs test_foobar
./python Lib/test/test_foobar.py   # for more detail about failures
}}}

== The tests ==

test_aepack (OSX only)

test_applesingle (OSX only)

test_asynchat FIXED IN SF http://www.python.org/sf/1752173 Alexandre Vassalotti 

test_audioop

test_bigmem FIXED IN SF 

test_bsddb

test_cProfile MINE AlexandreVassalotti alexandre@peadrop.com 2007-07-11

test_cmd_line: FIXED IN SF http://www.python.org/sf/1751493 ChristianHeimes -- COMMITTED

test_compile

test_cookielib

test_cpickle: not worth it? (I think this may be killed.)

test_csv: MINE HasanDiwan hasan.diwan@gmail.com 2007/07/11

test_ctypes: MINE ThomasHeller theller@ctypes.org 2007/07/11

test_descr GuidoVanRossum: FIXED r56252.

test_dl

test_doctest

test_email

test_email_codecs

test_email_renamed

test_frozen in Python/frozen.c ''{"__phello__.spam", M___hello__, SIZE},'' doesn't add a spam module.  (But why?!?!)

test_ftplib

test_getargs

test_gettext FIXED IN SF http://www.python.org/sf/1751958 ChristianHeimes

test_macostools (OSX only)

test_mailbox

test_minidom

test_mmap

test_old_mailbox

test_pep263 ChristianHeimes FIXED IN WIKI. The fix isn't worth a patch. You have to convert two string to byte by putting a b in front of them. .encode() returns bytes.  COMMITTED by ThomasHeller.

test_pickletools Pickle doesn't handle str vs. str8 vs. byte correctly. Do we pickle str as UNICODE or STRING?

test_plistlib (OSX only)

test_poll Christian Heimes FIXED IN WIKI: Replace MSG = " This is a test." with MSG = b" This is a test."  COMMITTED r56285.

test_poplib

test_pyexpat

test_quopri

test_resource

test_scriptpackages (OSX only)

test_sgmllib (passes on Ubuntu, fails on OSX)

test_shelve

test_sqlite

test_tarfile A lot of TypeError: can't concat bytes to str and other  byte/str confusions. 

test_tcl

test_threaded_import

test_ucn

test_unicode_file

test_urllib2

test_urllib2_localnet

test_uu

test_uuid (passes on OSX, fails on Ubuntu)

test_wave: probably not worth fixing; aren't we going to delete this?

test_xdrlib

test_xml_etree

test_xml_etree_c

test_xmlrpc

test_xpickle

test_zipimport: lots of str/bytes issues, shouldn't be too hard; important
