= List of tests that are failing in the py3k-struni branch =

(Back to ["Python3000"].)

Protocol:

  * if you start working on a test, to avoid duplicate work, add your name+email+date to the bulleted item for the test below, with the text "MINE"
  * if you figure out why a test is failing, just add a note (name etc. is still appreciated)
  * if you fix a test, and you check in the fix, add a note "FIXED" (occasionally we'll clean these up)
  * if you don't have checkin permissions, use the SF patch manager and note the patch number here (perhaps in the form of a link to python.org/sf/NNNNN), and add a note "FIXED IN SF" (plus name etc.)

== How to run tests ==

Assume you've got the py3k-struni branch checked out.
{{{
./configure
make
./python Lib/test/regrtest.py test_foobar  # runs test_foobar
./python Lib/test/test_foobar.py   # for more detail about failures
}}}
