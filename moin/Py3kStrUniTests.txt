(Back to ["Python3000"].)

= List of tests that are failing in the py3k branch =

We're now maintaining a list of tasks in a shared spreadsheet: http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pBLWM8elhFAmKbrhhh0ApQA

Protocol:

  * if you start working on a test, to avoid duplicate work, add your name+email+date to the bulleted item for the test below, with the text "MINE"
  * if you figure out why a test is failing, just add a note (name etc. is still appreciated)
  * if you fix a test, and you check in the fix, add a note "COMMITTED" with the svn revision (occasionally we'll clean these up)
  * if you don't have checkin permissions, use the SF patch manager and note the patch number here (perhaps in the form of a link to python.org/sf/NNNNN), and add a note "FIXED IN SF" (plus name etc.)

== How to run tests ==

Assume you've got the py3k branch checked out.

{{{
./configure
make
./python Lib/test/regrtest.py test_foobar  # runs test_foobar
./python Lib/test/test_foobar.py   # for more detail about failures
}}}

(Some tests need you to use {{{regrtest.py -uall}}} above.)

------

= The Failing Tests =

  * test_email (CosminStejerean - at least some problems seem to be caused by base64MIME, problems with splitting headers into multiple lines - 08/08/07) (VictorStinner - imghdr and sndhdr, related modules, are now fixed) (MINE Barry Warsaw)

  * test_email_codecs

  * test_email_renamed (should we get rid of this, as it's about an old renaming?)

  * test_xmlrpc - started failing after merge of new code from trunk


== Tests Failing Under Stress ==

A few tests pass normally but fail when run by a debug build using {{{regrtest.py -R4:3:}}}.  This runs the test 7 times to detect leaks.  The following tests have problems under this mode:

  * Confirmed failing tests:

    * test_structmember
    * test_collections - (avassalotti) py3k-r57265 runs this test fine on my machine.
    * test_runpy
    * test_asynchat (seems to hang in cleanup)

  * Intermittent failures:

    * test_gzip?
    * test_poplib? (Neal reported that it pegged the CPU)
    * test_mmap got a bus error when running -R 4:3: (also some test failures b/c I was running other tests and TESTFN was removed)

  * Unconfirmed failing tests:

    * test_tcl - _tkinter.TclError: Calling Tk_Init again after a previous call failed might deadlock


== Tests Failing on Some Platforms Only ==

  * test_ossaudiodev (64-bit)

  * test_coding (cygwin and some gentoo) - UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe1 in position 105: ordinal not in range(128)

  * test_marshal (cygwin)

  * test_normalization (gentoo) - same as test_coding.  On the machine they fail on, locale.getlocale() is (None, None)


=== Other Conditional Failures ===

  * test_shelve fails when the default database chosen by anydbm is bsddb. It works with dbm, gdbm and (presumably) with ndbm (all of which are very similar).
