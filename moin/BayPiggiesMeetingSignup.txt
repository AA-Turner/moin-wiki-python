= BayPiggies Meetings =

BayPiggies has moved holding meetings to the FOURTH Thursday (this may change) of each month. If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the attendee list for each applicable date.

Note also the change of location to '''Symantec''' (no longer at Google).

=== Overview ===
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM
 * Place: '''Symantec Vcafe, 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043'''
 * Map and directions to Symantec Vcafe: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Symantec+VCAFE&jsv=147d&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.176833,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ei=rmSmSYKEHpnmiwP35u3_Dw&cd=2&cid=37397198,-122053292,16258400465366002656&li=lmd&z=14
 * Closest Caltrain: Mountain View at Castro Street, which is right next to the Mountain View light rail station. Google Maps estimates it's 1.8 ml / 36 min walk, or 21 min by VTA. (Do people need to ask for rideshares from MV Caltrain?)
 * VTA stop: Middlefield station (behind buildings, but directly across Ellis street from the Symantec building) http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html
 * VTA schedule (southbound, weekdays): http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902SO_WK.html
 * VTA schedule (northbound, weekdays): http://www.vta.org/schedules/SC_902NO_WK.html


=== Security ===
 * There is no need for badging or sign in. No security personnel are present.

=== Parking ===
 * Symantec has sufficient exterior parking spaces to the south of the building at that time of day.      There is no street parking due to bike lanes.

=== Logistics ===
 * This venue is used by the ACCU and SVLUG groups and for their meetings one of the doors to the cafeteria/fitness building is left unlocked for entry. It is normally the closest door that is east of the presentation area. 

 * Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending. An example has been provided.
