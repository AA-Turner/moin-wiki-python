BayPiggies has moved holding meetings TO the FOURTH Thursday (this may change) of each month. If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the attendee list for each applicable date.
Note also the change of location to Symantec (no longer at Google).

=== Overview ===
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM
 * Place: Symantec Vcafe, 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043
 * Map and directions to Symantec Vcafe: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Symantec+VCAFE&jsv=147d&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.176833,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ei=rmSmSYKEHpnmiwP35u3_Dw&cd=2&cid=37397198,-122053292,16258400465366002656&li=lmd&z=14
 * Closest Caltrain: Mountain View Castro St. Don't have details about fastest way to get from there (VTA, bus, walk, cycle); Google Maps estimates it's 1.8 ml / 36 min walk, or 21 min by VTA. (Do people need to ask for rideshares from MV Caltrain?)

=== Security ===
 * Don't have any details about sign-in.

=== Parking ===
 * Don't have any details. Parking lot or on-street I guess.

=== Logistics ===
 * Don't have any details. Not sure if there will need to be badging.
 * Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending. An example has been provided.
