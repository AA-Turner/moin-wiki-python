   URL::  http://www.kryogenix.org/code/castalian/
   version:: 0.5 (''[[Date(2002-07-01T00:00:00)]]'')
   licence:: Python
   platforms:: Apache (developed on Linux, but should work with Windows etc too)
   Python versions:: 2.0 or better

=== Deployment Platforms ===
Should work with any Web server that supports CGI and Apache's Action directive -- only tested on Apache/Linux.

=== Suitability ===
An easy way to embed Python in your HTML pages, Castalian is particularly suitable for coders used to Microsoft's Active Server Pages, as it provides (most of) the ASP
object model -- if you're used to using request.querystring, response.write and so forth, but want to code in Python, you'll love Castalian.

=== Development Interfaces ===
Presentation oriented -- embed Python directly in your HTML pages, like PHP or Microsoft's ASP.

=== Environment Access ===
You have read access from the ASP-a-like request.servervariables, but you can also use the Pythonic os.environ to make changes if required.

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===
Sessions are currently not supported.

=== Persistence Support ===
Outside Castalian's scope -- persist objects as you would in any other Python application.

=== Presentation Support ===
HTML with embedded Python, which looks much like PHP. To run Python code in your pages, just enclose in &lt;?cas and ?&gt; tags.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===
Castalian is an engine that allows you to embed Python in HTML pages, and also provides (an approximation to) the Active Server Page object model.
Documentation for the object model and Castalian generally is available with the package.
Castalian is very easy to install -- simply drop the CGI in place on your web server and point .cas files to it. This simplicity comes at a speed
price, though; it is a little slower than frameworks that use mod_python or similar methods. This is unlikely to be a problem for sites not serving
vast numbers of users.
