Screencasting is the process of recording screencast - a video stream of picture from the screen (desktop, application or a single window). It allows to see how another person works through the eyes of this person. Tutorials, announcements, conference talks - many things benefit from a quality made screencast.

In Python, [[http://www.blendernation.com/|Blender community]] uses screencasts a lot and they even [[http://www.davidrevoy.com/index.php?article65/recordscreen-py-video-and-audio-capture-for-linux-with-ffmpeg|made Python helper]] to aid the process of capturing screen with FFMPEG on Linux.
