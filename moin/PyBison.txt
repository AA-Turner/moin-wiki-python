'''PyBison''' is a YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) style parser. PyBison was written by Scott Hassan in 1997 and almost disappeared.

There are scattered references to it all over the web, which all seem to
point to {{{http://coho.stanford.edu/~hassan/Python/pybison.tar.gz}}},
which forwards to the dead link {{{http://dotfunk.com/hassan/homepage/Python}}}
