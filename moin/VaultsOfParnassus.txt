= Vaults of Parnassus =

Quite a while ago the "Vaults of Parnassus" was a portal
serving as a general storehouse of Python goodies.  It was
found here:

http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/

In 2008 people complained about missing updates to the site.

Unfortunately the page is inactive at the the time of this writing (Feb 25, 2012).

If you were looking for a python package library you should go
over here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
