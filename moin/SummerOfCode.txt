This page coordinates the [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google Summer of Code] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

The 2008 PSF SoC coordinator is JamesTauber (jtauber at jtauber dot com). Contact him if you have any questions.

= Prospective Students =

If you are a student interested in working on core Python development or on a project that helps the Python community, we'd love to have you apply to the Python Software Foundation for this year's Google Summer of Code.

You should join the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2008-general soc2008-general] mailing list and take a look at the Project Ideas section below.

Students should read ["/Expectations"] to understand what is expected of them.

= Prospective Mentors =

Prospective mentors should join both the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2008-general soc2008-general] and [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2008-mentors soc2008-mentors] lists. Once you've been approved for the soc2008-mentors mailing list, you should introduce yourself and what project areas you can help mentor. Contact JamesTauber if you have any questions.

= Project Ideas =

 * CodingProjectIdeas/PythonCore (not necessarily all suitable for GSoC)
 * CodingProjectIdeas/StandardLibrary (not necessarily all suitable for GSoC)
 * [http://wiki.python.org/jython/SummerOfCode/PotentialProjects Jython Potential Projects]
 * Have a look at the suggestions for Crunchy [http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas].  Email Andr√© Roberge (andre.roberge at gmail dot com) for discussions of potential ideas.
 * We're releasing [http://www.drproject.org/DrProject DrProject] 3.0 at [http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/ PyCon] this year, and have lots of ideas for enhancements, many of which would be generally useful to the Python community as a whole.  Details will be up on the [http://www.drproject.org/DrProject DrProject] site soon; if you're keen for more information, please contact GregWilson ([mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu]).
 * The [http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/pygr pygr] bioinformatics project could use some software engineering love to bring it up to date in a variety of ways.  Chris Lee (pygr author) and Titus Brown are working on a possible task list for one GSoC student.

= Other Python-Related Organizations =

The organizations for 2008 have not yet been announced by Google but last year other organizations beside PSF who did Python-related work included: Zope, Plone, wxPython, Django, Bazaar, SCons, Thousand Parsec and !MoinMoin. I will update this list with links once Google has announced the list of organizations for 2008.

If you are applying as an organization and have projects involving Python, please contact JamesTauber so we can work more closely together.

= Previous years =

 * ["SummerOfCode/2005"]
 * ["SummerOfCode/2006"]
 * ["SummerOfCode/2007"]
