= Proposal ideas =

The following ideas are just suggestions.  You're free to invent your own ideas, or to use their suggestions as starting points.

 * Some ideas to help get you started: look at the SimpleTodo and CodingProjectIdeas pages.
 * Revive restricted Python -- inspired by a recent thread on the py3k list.
 * Create a bunch of modules like what Squeak has for 3D modeling,
 events etc. (the exact list may be somewhat different, I haven't
 researched this in any depth). This is inspired by a recommendation
 from Alan Kay made at the Shuttleworth workshop.
 * Add a web-based admin interface and/or user-oriented views to [http://www.third-bit.com/drproject DrProject], a lightweight project management portal intended for use in software engineering courses.
