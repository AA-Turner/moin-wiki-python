This page is for students and mentors for the [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google "Summer of Code"] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

Discussion about any Python-related SoC topic should take place on 
[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2006 the soc2006 mailing list].

For information on last year's accepted projects, see ["SummerOfCode/2005"].

The Drupal folks have some good information for students on how you should write your application:

 * [http://drupal.org/node/59963 Student requirements]
 * [http://drupal.org/node/59037 HOWTO write an application]

Here is Google's [http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html Student FAQ]

= Mentors: How to apply =

The mentor's responsibility is to ensure the student makes progress. This could entail coaching them, providing motivation, making sure they aren't stuck, answering technical questions, or pointing the student to the proper resources.  However, the mentor is not expected to do work for the student. In order to accomplish this, the mentor is expected to dedicate a couple of hours per week.

= Proposal ideas =

The ideas on the following pages are just suggestions. You're free to invent your own ideas, and don't have to use these suggestions as starting points.

 * ["SummerOfCode/PythonLibraries"]
 * ["SummerOfCode/Applications"]
 * ["SummerOfCode/PythonWebSite"]

= Related sponsors =

While not sponsors themselves, the PyPy and Jython projects have many SoC sized tasks available. For PyPy, see [http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/independent-project-ideas.html] for some concrete suggestions.

Those interested in working in [http://www.djangoproject.com Django] may do so [http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SummerOfCode2006 under the auspices of the Django group].

MoinMoin is also participating as their own organization, see [http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/GoogleSoc2006] for project ideas.

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/ BBC Research] is also a mentor organisation for python projects using the [http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Introduction.html Kamaelia] project for audio/video & multimedia/networking related projects, also for graphical construction of systems. Please see our [http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/SummerOfCode2006.html Summer of Code] page for more details. (There's some discussion on edu-sig which coincides with some of aims BTW, so if you're interested in python for schools, talk to us, we can't guarantee anything but you'll understand why we're interested if you chat to us!) The current list of ideas there that we're looking to mentor includes the following:
 * "Trusted Communications" (trusted by the user)
 * "Component bindings to AV codecs"
 * "Modifications of Visual Graphline editors, Reapplication to Graphline Video Editting"
 * "CSS-esque Styling and XML (?) Layout Definition of Pygame Applications"
 * "Collaborative Sketching Server - A P2P Events Backplane Application"
 * "Creation of an integrated bit torrent component"
 * "OpenGL widget framework"
 * "Hierarchical topology visualiser"
 * "Hierarchical Introspector"
 * "Distributed physics"
 * "Primitives for graphical composition"

Note: if a project is listed as having two mentors, the first mentor listed is the ''primary'' mentor, and the second one is the ''back-up'' mentor.
