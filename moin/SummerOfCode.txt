This page coordinates the [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google "Summer of Code"] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

We're just getting started for 2008 so stay tuned for a lot more information.

Everyone interested in Python projects at the Google Summer of Code should join '''soc2008-general'''. This includes prospective students and mentors.

The mentor list requires approval and the archive is private. It is intended only for (prospective) project mentors. If you haven't mentored before and would like to know more, feel free to join the list or contact JamesTauber with any questions you have. Prospective students should not join this list.
