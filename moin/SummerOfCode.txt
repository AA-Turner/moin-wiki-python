This page coordinates the [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google "Summer of Code"] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

Discussion about any Python-related SoC topic should take place on 
[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2006 the soc2006 mailing list].

== Project ideas ==

For 2007, the PSF would like to concentrate on projects that
advance PSF projects (CPython and its documentation, 
Jython and its documentation, the Python web site).
The following pages list some ideas:

 * SimpleTodo -- very small projects.
 * ["CodingProjectIdeas/PythonCore"] -- ideas for the CPython interpreter.
 * ["CodingProjectIdeas/StandardLibrary"]
 * JythonProjects

== Previous years ==

 * ["SummerOfCode/2005"]
 * ["SummerOfCode/2006"]
