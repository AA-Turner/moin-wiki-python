This page coordinates the [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google "Summer of Code"] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

We're just getting started for 2008 so stay tuned for a lot more information.

The 2008 PSF SoC coordinator is JamesTauber (jtauber at jtauber dot com). Contact him if you have any questions.

== Mailing Lists ==

 * [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2008-general soc2008-general]

Everyone interested in Python projects at the Google Summer of Code should join '''soc2008-general'''. This includes prospective students and mentors.

The mentor list requires approval and the archive is private. It is intended only for (prospective) project mentors. If you haven't mentored before and would like to know more, feel free to join the list or contact JamesTauber with any questions you have. Prospective students should not join this list.

== Project Ideas ==

Students should read ["/Expectations"] to understand what is expected of them.

More here soon.

 * Have a look at the suggestions for Crunchy [http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas].  Email Andr√© Roberge (andre.roberge at gmail dot com) for discussions of potential ideas.
 * We're releasing [http://www.drproject.org/DrProject DrProject] 3.0 at [http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/ PyCon] this year, and have lots of ideas for enhancements, many of which would be generally useful to the Python community as a whole.  Details will be up on the [http://www.drproject.org/DrProject DrProject] site soon; if you're keen for more information, please contact GregWilson ([mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu]).
