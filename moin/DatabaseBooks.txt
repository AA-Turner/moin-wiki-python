'''An Introduction to Database Systems'''
C.J. Date
ISBN: ISBN:0201385902

A textbook explaining the relational model in great detail, and
written by a well-known relational database commentator.
New editions of this book are regularly released every two or three years, so the ISBN
might be out of date; the ISBN is for the seventh edition, but you should check 
if there's a newer one.
(On the other hand, old editions are still perfectly
readable and useful, and likely can be found much more cheaply.)

Morgan Kaufmann, May 1999.

Discusses algorithms and techniques for compressing, indexing, and
