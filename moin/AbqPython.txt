= AbqPython is the local Python user's group in Albuquerque, New Mexico. =

This group is mainly organized as a !MeetUp group: http://www.meetup.com/AbqPython/. We generally meet on the first Tuesday of the month. See the Meetup page for upcoming events and meeting details (the location sometimes changes).

We also have a listserv.  To sign up, visit https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/abqpy.

Members are encouraged to get themselves into [[FrontPage#use | the editor's group of this Wiki]] and to create their own pages to serve as a home for their Python (and other) notes and to contribute to this page and pages under it.
