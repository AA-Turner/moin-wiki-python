== AbqPython is the local Python user's group in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ==

This group is mainly organized as a [[http://www.meetup.com/AbqPython/ | MeetUp Group]] so look there for meeting announcements but this page is being created to contain other useful Python information related to that group.
