Paul Winkler here, couple things i wanted to touch on that seemed too cumbersome to email to the whole sprint group... 

Workstations: Is this BYO? If so, any particular Python version I should install? 2.2.2?
Anything else required? cvs of course...

Experience:  I hope I'm not totally over my head here, I suspect I'm the biggest noob of the bunch. I've never done XP before.  I've been a pythonista since about '99 and working with Zope 2 almost as long; currently I'm a full-time Zope / python developer. But I haven't done squat with Z3 and i have limited time to play with it before Monday. I did read http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/pairing.htm and feel a bit better :)

Pair programming & editor wars: i can work OK in vim or emacs, but what if my partner won't work without his Bloatware IDE SuperDeluxe? ;-)
