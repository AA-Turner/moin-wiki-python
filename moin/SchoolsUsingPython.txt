This is a listing of schools that are using Python in their curriculum.

I would like to confirm each of the schools below by linking to a specific web page with a course listing and/or the professor(s) teaching classes that involve the use of Python. Each listing should be expanded with a description of how Python is being used. -- KevinAltis

Need to copy info from:
 * http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/pyBiblio/schools.php

= High Schools =

 * Yorktown High School, in Arlington Virginia ([http://www.elkner.net/ Jeff Elkner])
 * [http://www.gfc.edu.co/colegio/proyectos/spt/ Gimnasio Fidel Cano], Bogotá, Colombia ([http://igor.tamarapatino.org Igor Támara])
= Colleges and Universities =

== Australia ==

 * University of New South Wales
  * Computer science taught/teaches course(s) with Python (as of about 2001)

 * RMIT University
  * Computer science teaches course with Python

== Canada ==

 * University of Toronto
  * The CS department has introduced [http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/crs_csc.htm#CSC120H1 Computer Science for the Sciences], an introductory course aimed at (mainly) life sciences students.
  * [http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc207h/winter CSC207H] is a third-semester course that teaches several weeks of Python.
  * A few 2nd- and 3rd-year theory courses have students implement some algorithms in Python.

 * University of Waterloo
  * One of the more prestigious engineering/comp-sci schools in Canada is using it officially in [http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/ CS488 (Intro to 3D graphics)], and I'm told there's lots of use among faculty, staff and students.  I don't think they actually teach much Python, they're focused on teaching OpenGL/graphics programming, but they do wind up using it as the framework into which the students slot their code.

 * Cégep du Vieux-Montréal
  * Used for Advanced Web Development course (420-B63-VM)
  * Note: Cégeps are collegiate level schools giving a 2 year pre-university program or a 3 year professionnal program such as [http://www.cvm.qc.ca/informatique/pages/main.html Computing Technology]
