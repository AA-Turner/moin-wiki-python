This is a listing of schools that are using Python in their curriculum.

I would like to confirm each of the schools below by linking to a specific web page with a course listing and/or the professor(s) teaching classes that involve the use of Python. Each listing should be expanded with a description of how Python is being used. -- KevinAltis
