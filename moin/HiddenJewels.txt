= Hidden Jewels =

"Hidden Jewels", (for lack of a better name,) are features in Python that people don't necessarily know about, even amongst long-time Python programmers.

For example, [http://www.seapig.org/August2003Notes at a recent Python meeting in Seattle,] we learned of many such features from each other:

 *  [http://www.seapig.org/DocXMLRPCServer The DocXMLRPCServer,] which makes writing servers and clients dirt easy, and entirely self-documenting.
 *  [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/84317 Future threads,] which make threading so simple, you don't even have to know how it works.

I'd programmed Python for 4 years, but I never stumbled across these features. There are likely many more like this.

Perhaps we need to rename this page to "CoolPythonThings", or something like that.
