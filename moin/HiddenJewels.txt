= Hidden Jewels =

"Hidden Jewels", (for lack of a better name,) are powerful Python capabilities of general interest that people don't know about, even long-time Python programmers.

For example, [[http://www.seapig.org/August2003Notes|at a recent Python meeting in Seattle,]] few of us knew about:

 *  [[http://www.seapig.org/DocXMLRPCServer|The DocXMLRPCServer,]] which makes writing servers and clients dirt easy, and entirely self-documenting.
 *  [[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/84317|Future threads,]] which make threading so simple, you don't even have to know how it works.

There are likely many more like this.

Perhaps we need to rename this page to "CoolPythonThings", or something like that.
