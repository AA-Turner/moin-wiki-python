At the end of 2013/beginning of 2014, a survey was conducted to see how much 3.x is catching on.

The survey was publicized via posts to [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2013-December/663539.html|comp.lang.python]], [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-December/130834.html|python-dev]] and [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6990481|Hacker News]].

You can find the results here in PDF format: [[attachment:2013-2014 Python 2.x-3.x survey.pdf]].

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq1sLIA-T44zdEhYdkQ3WVlhSnVRX2tobjVoRFdpTlE&gid=2|Results are also available as a single chart]]. Unfortunately, you need to mouse over the labels to see the full question text.
