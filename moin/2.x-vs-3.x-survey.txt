At the end of 2013/beginning of 2014, a survey was conducted to see how much 3.x is catching on.

The survey itself is [[https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/N5N5PG2|here]].  Note that recent takers of the survey will not see their results in the PDF below.

The survey was publicized via posts to [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2013-December/663539.html|comp.lang.python]], [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-December/130834.html|python-dev]] and [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6990481|hacker news]].

You can find the results here in PDF format: [[attachment:2013-2014 Python 2.x-3.x survey.pdf]].
