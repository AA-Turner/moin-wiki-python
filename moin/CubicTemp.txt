=== Suitability ===

CubicTemp should be used in association with a good web framework. It is small and simple enough to be modified on a per-project basis. 

A back ported version of CubicTemp is available from my page AshishShrestha. This works with Jython 2.1 This allows it to be used with servlet engines like Tomcat. I think the simplicity of CubicTemp and ease of Jython is a cool combination for web development.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

CubicTemp is an attempt to make a Python templating system that is simple, powerful and well designed. Cubictemp also has built-in protection against cross-site-scripting attac, a very common class of web application vulnerability. 

=== Comments ===

CubicTemp is pretty elegant and easy, however I discovered several major drawbacks:
 * block structure is designed to be html comments, but is relying on python-like indentation. Former allows editing in html editors like DreamWeaver and later precludes their usage as they disrupt indentation with mixing tabs and spaces with variable tab length.
 * if-then-else blocks are missing.

Actually, Cubictemp has an if-then-else structure built in - you can do if-then-else blocks simply and elegantly by declaring two named blocks, and using the if-then-else structure to decide which to substitute into the rendered page....
