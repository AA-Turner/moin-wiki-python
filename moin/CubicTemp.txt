=== Suitability ===

CubicTemp should be used in association with a good web framework. It is small and simple enough to be modified on a per-project basis. 

A back ported version of CubicTemp is available in my page AshishShrestha. This works with Jython 2.1 This allows it to be used with servlet engines like Tomcat. I think the simplicity of CubicTemp and ease of Jython is a cool combination for web development.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

CubicTemp is an attempt to make a Python templating system that is simple, powerful and well designed.
