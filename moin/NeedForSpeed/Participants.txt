John Benediktsson

 * John Benediktsson is a senior developer at EWT.  For several years now, John has been involved with the creation of electronic trading strategies as well as much of the core trading technology at EWT.


Martin Blais

 * Martin Blais from Montreal, Canada, has a background in high-end
 computer graphics.  After completing his graduate studies, he went on to work for graphics companies on global illumination problems and post-production software.  He has been a heavy user of the Python language since 1999.  Occasionally providing independent consulting services, he now offers a professional training course on Python.  Martin is also currently involved in an independent venture related to the web.  You can find many of his public bits of code at http://furius.ca


Georg Brandl

 * Georg Brandl from Augsburg, Germany is a Physics student and Computer Science addict. He is probably the only one not exactly knowing why he has been invited to the sprint in the first place, but nevertheless very thankful to have been offered this opportunity. He hopes to learn a lot from all the experienced attendants and contribute a bit to Python development.

 * [Comment from Raymond] Georg is a core Python developer and active participant on the python-dev and python-3000 maillists.  He is completely up-to-date on Py2.5's novelties and Guido's intentions for the future.  Hopefully this sprint will give him a chance to show-off his skills, learn from the pros, and continue to be a rising star.


Anders Chrigstroem

 * No bio yet


Antonio Cuni

 * Antonio Cuni from Genova in Italy is a graduating student of Computer Science at the Genova's University. He joined the PyPy project two months ago and started writing the CLI backend as a part of his thesis. He hopes to gain more confidence about PyPy internals and to make significant progresses in the CLI backend during the sprint.


Andrew Dalke

Jack Diedrich

 * Jack is a serial dotcomer currently living in Boston, Massachusetts.  He is the Chief Technologist and a partner at Psynchronous Communications, Inc.  He will be sprinting on whatever needs a hand or on a specialized symbol dictionary if he can get the first draft finished before the sprint.


Beatrice During

 * Bea was a teacher of history before she was swallowed up by a swedish IT company back in '''those''' days. She is now working in the PyPy project with management and dissemination and is privileged to be working with such skilled people in such a lively community. She will participate in the sprint, not coding, but focusing on following the work of the 0.9 release of PyPy. She is looking forward to meet EWT and CCP again, uncle Timmy and the rest of the gang.


Richard Emslie

 * Richard Emslie is a developer at EWT.  He contributes to the PyPy project in many areas including the LLVM backend. 


Raymond Hettinger

 * PSF member and core python developer (sets, itertools, peephole optimizer, decimals, deques and such).  Former CPA, former fashion photographer,  recently hired by EWT as Chief Visualization Officer.  Personal interests include language design and photography.  


Steve Holden

 * Steve Holden from Linlithgow in Scotland is the author of "Python Web Programming" and a director of the Python Software Foundation, chaired the first three PyCon conferences and now manages a transatlantic training and consulting practice. He hopes to be able to use his knowledge of Python, conference organisation, the software industry and open source to make this sprint both productive and enjoyable for all concerned, possibly even in that order.


Michael Hudson

 * No bio yet


Bob Ippolito

 * Bob Ippolito from San Francisco, CA is an avid Python developer and open source contributor, particularly in the Mac OS X arena. He hopes to leverage his low-level programming experience and persistence to improve the usability and performance of the PyPy LLVM back end during this sprint.  He's also interested in enjoying some Icelandic beer and discussing crazy ideas with the other sprint attendees.


Kristján Valur Jónsson

 * Kristján Valur Jónsson was born in 1970 and grew up in Reykjavík, Iceland.  He graduated with an CSc of Mechanical Engineering from the University of Iceland in 1997.  Kristján has been involved in computers from an early age.  He has worked at various companies mostly involving graphics and internet technology.  He is currently employed at CCP Inc, where he is core systems engineer and responsible for the integration of Stackless Python in the game engine of EVE, a massively multiplayer online role playing game.


Richard Jones

 * Richard is from Melbourne, Australia and has been developing with Python for about a decade. Given his interest in video games (he sometimes writes them in his spare time), he'll happily do whatever CCP ask. He'd also be happy to work with other groups too, as there's some interesting ideas on the Goals page. Those Icelandic beers and crazy ideas sound good too.


Holger Krekel

 * No bio yet


Anders Lehman

 * Anders Lehmann has worked in the Audio/Video industry for 15 years.  In 2000 he discovered python and never looked back. He has attended IPC 9 in 2001, Europython 2003 and 2004, and Pycon 2006. In 2005 he got employed by german DFKI to work full time on PyPy the EU project. 


Fredrik Lundh

 * Fredrik Lundh is a principal of Secret Labs, Inc., the creators of PythonWorks, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. He is an expert on the use of Python with images and graphics and is also the creator of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). He is an active member of the Python community and a frequent contributor to the Python newsgroups.  His website and blog are at http://effbot.org/

Sean Reifschneider

 * Sean Reifschneider, from Fort Collins, Colorado, is a founder and member of technical staff of tummy.com, ltd.  He's been a Python user and advocate since 1997.  The primary area he expects to be working on relate to performance improvements via re-implementation of code in C and other C Python or python library work.  He expects to make use of unit tests to ensure quality of resulting code and quantify performance improvements.  He looks forward to a successful sprint, in part, for selfish reasons.  If the sprint outcome is positive, hopefully we all will be invited to and sponsored for attendance at future sprints.   :-) 


Armin Rigo

 * Leader of the PyPy project and creator of pysco optimization tool.


David Salomon

 * David Salomon is CEO of EWT.  He has over twenty years of experience in the securities business.  David has a passion for technology and its application.  He is interested in the vital link between private enterprise and the open source community.


Richard M Tew

 * Richard is a New Zealander who moved to Iceland to live so that he could work for CCP on EVE Online.  His job involves writing game logic for EVE in Python, and CCP also allows him to do the odd bit for Stackless Python to help out Christian. He doesn't know much about this PyPy thing, but he knows he will be getting a week away from space pirates, space ships,  spacious offices and will hopefully be doing something that makes his job easier and/or funner.


Christian Tismer

 * Major contributor to the PyPy project and creator of StacklessPython.


Jason Wells

 * Jason wells is a senior developer at EWT.  He has many years of experience building high performance securities trading systems.
