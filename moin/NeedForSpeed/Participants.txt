Georg Brandl

 * Georg Brandl from Augsburg, Germany is a Physics student and Computer Science addict. He is probably the only one not exactly knowing why he has been invited to the sprint in the first place, but nevertheless very thankful to have been offered this opportunity. He hopes to learn a lot from all the experienced attendants and contribute a bit to Python development.

 * [Comment from Raymond] Georg is a core Python developer and active participant on the python-dev and python-3000 maillists.  He is completely up-to-date on Py2.5's novelties and Guido's intentions for the future.  Hopefully this sprint will give him a chance to show-off his skills, learn from the pros, and continue to be a rising star.

Anders Chrigstroem

Antonio Cuni

 * Antonio Cuni from Genova in Italy is a graduating student of Computer Science at the Genova's University. He joined the PyPy project two months ago and started writing the CLI backend as a part of his thesis. He hopes to gain more confidence about PyPy internals and to make significant progresses in the CLI backend during the sprint.

Jack Diedrich

 * Jack is a serial dotcomer currently living in Boston, Massachusetts.  He is the Chief Technologist and a partner at Psynchronous Communications, Inc.  He will be sprinting on whatever needs a hand or on a specialized symbol dictionary if he can get the first draft finished before the sprint.

Raymond Hettinger

 * PSF member and core python developer (sets, itertools, peephole optimizer, decimals, deques and such).  Former CPA, former fashion photographer,  recently hired by EWT as Chief Visualization Officer.  Personal interests include language design and photography.  

Steve Holden

 * Steve Holden from Linlithgow in Scotland is the author of "Python Web Programming" and a director of the Python Software Foundation, chaired the first three PyCon conferences and now manages a transatlantic training and consulting practice. He hopes to be able to use his knowledge of Python, conference organisation, the software industry and open source to make this sprint both productive and enjoyable for all concerned, possibly even in that order.

Michael Hudson

Bob Ippolito

 * Bob Ippolito from San Francisco, CA is an avid Python developer and open source contributor, particularly in the Mac OS X arena. He hopes to leverage his low-level programming experience and persistence to improve the usability and performance of the PyPy LLVM back end during this sprint.  He's also interested in enjoying some Icelandic beer and discussing crazy ideas with the other sprint attendees.

Richard Jones

 * Richard is from Melbourne, Australia and has been developing with Python for about a decade. Amongst other things, he's responsible for [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi PyPI] and has a long list of potential improvements. Given his interest in video games, he'll happily do whatever CCP ask. He'd also be happy to work with other groups too, as there's some interesting ideas on the Goals page. Those Icelandic beers and crazy ideas sound good too.

Holger Krekel

Anders Lehman

 * Anders Lehmann has worked in the Audio/Video industry for 15 years.  In 2000 he discovered python and never looked back. He has attended IPC 9 in 2001, Europython 2003 and 2004, and Pycon 2006. In 2005 he got employed by german DFKI to work full time on PyPy the EU project.

Sean Reifschneider

 * Sean Reifschneider, from Fort Collins, Colorado, is a founder and member of technical staff of tummy.com, ltd.  He's been a Python user and advocate since 1997.  The primary area he expects to be working on relate to performance improvements via re-implementation of code in C and other C Python or python library work.  He expects to make use of unit tests to ensure quality of resulting code and quantify performance improvements.  He looks forward to a successful sprint, in part, for selfish reasons.  If the sprint outcome is positive, hopefully we all will be invited to and sponsored for attendance at future sprints.   :-)
