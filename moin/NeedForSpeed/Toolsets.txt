Subversion client software (Windows users may use SVN Tortoise, Putty and Pageant).  Get your SSH2 key installed and verify you can commit.

Suitable IRC client (XIRC or similar).

  FredrikLundh: How about IM tools too?  Google Talk?  (I'm no IRC user, so maybe modern IRC tools cover point-to-point communication too?  Please enlighten me).

  SeanReifschneider: IRC *CAN* do person-to-person talk, as well as small or ad-hoc groups of people, much like IM.  You can "/msg user" to send them a private message, in xchat that opens a new tab for user-to-user communication.  You can "/join #channel" to create a new channel named "channel" that you can invite others to.  I can do IM, please ask me directly for my IM name in AIM or Google Talk, Python folks are welcome to it, but I keep it kind of private.

  GeorgBrandl: Would a kind of collaborative text editor be helpful? For non-Macintosh users, [http://gobby.0x539.de Gobby] comes to mind.
