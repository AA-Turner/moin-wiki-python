= Preparation and Tools =

* Checkout and build CPython:

  svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk python-svn

* Checkout and browse pysco:

   svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/psyco/dist/ psyco-dist


* Sign the [[http://www.python.org/psf/contrib-form.html|Python contributor agreement]]  ''Steve and Raymond will have copies at the Sprint''

* Subversion client software (Windows users may use SVN Tortoise, Putty and Pageant).  Get your SSH2 key installed and verify you can commit.

* IRC client (XIRC or similar).  Server: irc.freenode.net channel: #nfs

  FredrikLundh: How about IM tools too?  Google Talk?  (I'm no IRC user, so maybe modern IRC tools cover point-to-point communication too?  Please enlighten me).

  SeanReifschneider: IRC *CAN* do person-to-person talk, as well as small or ad-hoc groups of people, much like IM.  You can "/msg user" to send them a private message, in xchat that opens a new tab for user-to-user communication.  You can "/join #channel" to create a new channel named "channel" that you can invite others to.  I can do IM, please ask me directly for my IM name in AIM or Google Talk, Python folks are welcome to it, but I keep it kind of private.

  GeorgBrandl: Would a kind of collaborative text editor be helpful? For non-Macintosh users, [[http://gobby.0x539.de|Gobby]] comes to mind.

  SteveHolden: I think we can probably do without anything so fancy - pair programming can be the major staple, probably.

* Bring a 220 power adapter suitable for European two-pin mains supply.      Many laptop transformers are rated for 100-240V, 50-60Hz (read the fine print on them); in that case you only need an adapter, with two circular pins to plug in, and any kind of female slots into which you can plug your transformer.  That costs just a few dollars (at, e.g., a Radio Shack).  If your equipment is not rated for multi-voltage usage and is not 220V, then you need to buy a more expensive step-down converter.

* If you don't normally travel to Iceland, and intend to use an ATM card to get cash, you may want to tell your card vendor about your travel plans, so they don't slap a hold on your card due to "suspicious activity".
