= Things that we tried but decided were not good ideas. =

'''List pre-allocation'''

Adding the ability to pre-allocate builtin list storage. At best we can speed up appends by about 7-8% for lists of 50-100 elements. For the large part the benefit is 0-2%. For lists under 20 elements, peformance is actually reduced when pre-allocating.

'''Out-thinking exceptions'''

CPython spends considerable time moving exception info around among thread states, frame objects, and the `sys` module.  This code is complicated and under-documented.  Patch SF:1145039 took a stab at reverse-engineering a weak invariant, and exploited it for a bit of speed.  That worked fine so far as it went (and a variant was checked in), but it's likely more remains to be gotten.  Alas, the `tim-exc_sanity` branch set up to try that consumed a lot of time fighting mysteries, and looks like it's more trouble than it's worth.
