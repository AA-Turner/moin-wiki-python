These things still need attention:

Note: Any branches that are not intended to continue work should be removed before leaving the sprint. '''DONE''' - TP


 * The hotbuf branch will be completed after the sprint.  I want to implement common parsing patterns (line delimited, netstrings) in C (MartinBlais).
 * The patch implementing optimizing out "if 0" still needs review.
 * Andrew Dalke has experimented with optimizing some common cases in argument parsing, which looks very promising, but needs further attention.
 * Internal string->object parsing routines (int(), float(), etc) need a way to bound the portion of the string they'll look at.  This is partly bugfix, since passing a buffer object to such a Python-level routine results in anything from nonsense to segfaults now.
 * Tim intends to continue work on the `tim-exc_sanity` branch.
 * Ran out of time before getting to most of the "speed function calls" patches.  Since any speedup in that area would benefit almost all users,  they're still well worth pursuing.
