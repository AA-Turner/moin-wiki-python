2006-05-22 10:06:51>  <jafo> How does Python decide to do the up-convert from int to long?  I've converted all the types, I think, to "long long", but 1<<32 is going to L.
2006-05-22 10:12:02>  *** doctorwells has joined #nfs
2006-05-22 10:13:09>  <ymmit> jafo:  for 1<<32, see intobject.c's int_lshift.
2006-05-22 10:13:20>  <jafo> Thanks.
2006-05-22 10:13:57>  <ymmit> You're probably see that the platform LONG_BIT is #define'd as 32, so left shift figures it _needs_ a Python long.

2006-05-22 10:44:14>  <doctorwells> cool, what part?  virtualized keys(), values() and items() ?
2006-05-22 10:44:37>  <jbenedik> we'll see how much - ideally yes
2006-05-22 10:44:40>  <jbenedik> faster iteration
2006-05-22 10:44:44>  <jbenedik> virtualized access
2006-05-22 10:46:11>  <jafo> Ok, this is extremely weird.  I converted the int stuff to long long on 32-bit platforms, and I'm getting:
2006-05-22 10:46:13>  <jafo> Average round time:    4081.70 ms             -100.00%
2006-05-22 10:46:26>  <jafo> The -100.00% is consistent.
2006-05-22 10:47:02>  <doctorwells> sounds a lot faster
2006-05-22 10:48:08>  <jafo> But the original is: Average round time:    4037.00 ms
2006-05-22 10:48:25>  <jafo> Oh, wait, obviously there's a problem in my conversion to long long...
2006-05-22 10:48:34>  <rxe> doctorwells: joining the sprint remotely?  :-)
2006-05-22 10:48:44>  <doctorwells> sumthin' like that
2006-05-22 10:50:19>  <jafo> So, it looks like on pybench the difference is 1.11% slow-down by going to long long.
2006-05-22 10:51:03>  <jafo> So, do we want to suck it up, or give it a pass?  Anyone?
2006-05-22 10:51:26>  <jbenedik> What kind of speedup do you get when you overflow?  any?
2006-05-22 10:51:40>  <doctorwells> does pybench do anything with ints in the 32 - 64 bit range?
2006-05-22 10:51:53>  <jafo> Don't know and don't know.
2006-05-22 10:55:17>  <jafo> Looks like 1<<35 is around 34% faster.

2006-05-23 04:58:49>  <jafo> runarp: So, on the string offset idea.  Adding string offsets to a function seems like the camels nose under the tent, if you know the expression.  It seems like there are a lot of places it would be nice to have that.  I wonder if it might be possible to do something like have a string sub-class that is a StringOffset(s, start, length) sort of thing, that would be light a light weight wrapper on top of string, which some functions would be specialized to 
2006-05-23 04:58:49>  <jafo> handle.
2006-05-23 04:59:52>  <jafo> In the case of functions that don't understand it, the class could look like a regular string and provide a slice.  For functions that do understand it, they could bypass the slicing.

2006-05-23 11:07:51>  <jafo> Hey there.
2006-05-23 11:08:11>  <bcannon> I just realized my math was off because I subtracted instead of added 7 hours.  =)
2006-05-23 11:08:15>  <jafo> Still kind of scratching our heads as to where the performance change is.
2006-05-23 11:08:32>  <jafo> guin:msglog$ TZ=GMT date
2006-05-23 11:08:32>  <jafo> Tue May 23 17:08:27 GMT 2006
2006-05-23 11:08:50>  <jafo> I don't do math when I check the time here.
2006-05-23 11:08:54>  <bcannon> So a possibility is the PyException_* macros that are used to verify that an object is acceptable as a macro.
2006-05-23 11:09:40>  <bcannon> Those are at several key points in the code path and they do several checks so there are more 'if' checks and have more memory accesses.
2006-05-23 11:09:58>  <bcannon> I don't think object creation is done in a stupid way so I don't think it is from object creation, but it is a possibility.
2006-05-23 11:10:39>  <bcannon> Otherwise I can't think of any specific points where the differences were huge.
2006-05-23 11:10:41>  <jafo> Ok, a few things.
2006-05-23 11:10:56>  <bcannon> Unless checking for string exceptions for possible warnings is just ridiculously costly.
2006-05-23 11:11:02>  <jafo> We seem to still be seeing performance issues, even if we've already created the object.
2006-05-23 11:11:10>  <bcannon> OK.
2006-05-23 11:11:24>  <jafo> We're looking at the macros now, and it seems like they would be getting called for both new and old style objects.
2006-05-23 11:11:47>  <bcannon> So this is a performance hit in 2.5 for both new-style and classi?
2006-05-23 11:11:54>  <bcannon> I thought this was a 2.4 -> 2.5 issue.
2006-05-23 11:12:10>  <jafo> Kind of.
2006-05-23 11:12:28>  <jafo> In 2.5, old style classes if thrown as an exception show no performance drop from 2.4.3.
2006-05-23 11:12:34>  <bcannon> OK
2006-05-23 11:12:43>  <jafo> New style classes show like a 100% drop.
2006-05-23 11:13:46>  <bcannon> Unfortunately I am at work and just discovered svn is not installed so I can't check the code out and look.
2006-05-23 11:14:03>  <jafo> Ok.
2006-05-23 11:14:15>  <jafo> There is, of course: http://svn.python.org/view?rev=42711&view=rev
2006-05-23 11:14:31>  <bcannon> Going from memory, the differences in terms of code path is that obviously that new-style exceptions are new-style classes (but you mostly showed that is not needed).
2006-05-23 11:14:33>  <jafo> We can dig into the macros and see if it seems that that is it.
2006-05-23 11:15:12>  <bcannon> I remember there is a place where divergence happens in the code path based on type; give me a minute to try to find it.
2006-05-23 11:15:30>  <jafo> Based on old or new style classes you mean?
2006-05-23 11:15:33>  <jafo> We haven't seen that.
2006-05-23 11:16:09>  <bcannon> Yeah, I think there is one spot; but my memory could be foggy since I had spent the previous day at the sprints fixing a bitch of a bug to track down and so my brain was frazzled.
2006-05-23 11:16:24>  <jafo> Ah.
2006-05-23 11:20:13>  <jafo> Thanks for popping in.  I'm trying dikeing out some of the macros for our limited tests and seeing if that has an impact.
2006-05-23 11:20:34>  <bcannon> OK, what I was remembering is that block change in errors.c
2006-05-23 11:20:52>  <jafo> haven't looked in errors.c
2006-05-23 11:24:09>  <bcannon> When benchmarking, is it purely in raising an exception, or are you also viewing the exception in any way to trigger the __repr__ or __unicode__ methods?
2006-05-23 11:24:28>  <jafo> Purely raising the exception.
2006-05-23 11:24:30>  <bcannon> OK
2006-05-23 11:24:37>  <jafo> try: raise ValueError
2006-05-23 11:24:40>  <jafo> except: pass
2006-05-23 11:25:26>  <bcannon> And no difference if you ``raise ValueError()`` or catching the specific exception?
2006-05-23 11:25:53>  <jafo> Have only tried "raise ValueError, 5".
2006-05-23 11:26:05>  <jafo> I can try the except ValueError in a few.
2006-05-23 11:26:09>  *** grunar has joined #nfs
2006-05-23 11:26:39>  <bcannon> Actually, try it so that the object creation is outside of the timing code and raise the instance.
2006-05-23 11:26:43>  <jafo> Ok, if I change PyExceptionClass_Check to "1", pybench doesn't show any impact.
2006-05-23 11:26:55>  <bcannon> OK
2006-05-23 11:28:38>  <jafo> Trying outside of the timing code.
2006-05-23 11:28:50>  *** jbenedik has joined #nfs
2006-05-23 11:30:09>  <jafo> It's looking like by moving it out of the loop it's faster than 2.4.3 by an amazing amount.
2006-05-23 11:30:18>  <jafo> 50%.
2006-05-23 11:30:19>  <bcannon> =)
2006-05-23 11:30:29>  <jafo> I guess it's not that amazing, but yeah, faster.
2006-05-23 11:30:31>  <bcannon> So it is new-style instantiation.
2006-05-23 11:30:46>  <jafo> Wait a moment.
2006-05-23 11:30:46>  <bcannon> Or at least a good chunk of it.
2006-05-23 11:30:49>  <bcannon> OK
2006-05-23 11:31:01>  <jafo> I need to re-run the baseline.
2006-05-23 11:31:07>  <bcannon> ok
2006-05-23 11:32:55>  <jafo> Ok.  With the exception outside the timing loop, it's the same speed on 2.4.3 and 2.5a2.
2006-05-23 11:33:02>  <jafo> So, yeah, instance creation.
2006-05-23 11:33:05>  <bcannon> Figures.
2006-05-23 11:33:14>  <jafo> I guess there's nothing that can be done there.
2006-05-23 11:33:20>  <bcannon> =)
2006-05-23 11:33:31>  <bcannon> Can always work your voodoo on instance creation.  =)
2006-05-23 11:34:01>  <jafo> What makes you think I have voodoo?
2006-05-23 11:34:13>  <bcannon> Or perhaps there is a better way to define the class than how it is currently.
2006-05-23 11:34:41>  <jafo> I don't honestly know.
2006-05-23 11:35:15>  <bcannon> Could possibly be better to define the class all in C with a proper struct instead of using a PyMethodDef for the magic methods.
2006-05-23 11:35:26>  <bcannon> That should help take out some overhead.
2006-05-23 11:35:52>  *** ccpRichard2 has quit IRC
2006-05-23 11:35:54>  <bcannon> Assuming that doesn't break code somewhere for some odd reason.
2006-05-23 11:36:24>  <bcannon> But basically that is the best I can think of.  Might not be bad in terms of cleanup of the code anyway.

2006-05-24 10:56:53>  <Yhg1s> etrepum: no, it shouldn't.
2006-05-24 10:57:17>  <Yhg1s> (assuming we're talking about Python ints and longs; C ints and longs should be automatically converted, and not slow anyway)

2006-05-27 16:58:24>  <mwh> it's leaking a tuple containing two Nones a string and an int, i think
2006-05-27 17:00:19>  <mwh> oh well, i guess sean and richard know what they changed...
