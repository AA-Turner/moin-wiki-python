The following goals were included in the sprint announcement. Please use this area as a staging point to indicate interest in specific goals and discuss possible approaches, recruit support for half-baked ideas and so on. This is a '''''Wiki''''', people! Create new pages at will.

 * Improving the decimal module by implementing portions in C

 * Investigate whether RPython offers sufficient speedup over the regular CPython interpreter to replace tailored C and C++ code in MMP gaming applications

 * Implement an ordered dictionary in both C and Python

 * Implement data-structure-specific algorithms, which rely heavily on certain data structures, as RPython

 * Adding an iterator interface (similar to re.finditer) to the struct module

 * Further refine the PyPy LLVM back end to improve general execution speeds

 * Offer the PyPy team a sprint venue to continue their development work on Python implementations written in Python

 * Create a string subtype that provides lazy slicing without copying
