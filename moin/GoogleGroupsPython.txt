= Posting from Google Groups =
Many people find reading the comp.lang.python newsgroup / python-list mailing list on [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.python|Google Groups]] to be simple and convenient.  It is also possible to post messages to the list from there.  However, messages sent from Google Groups have some problems that some readers of the Python list would appreciate if you fix before clicking the Post button.

1. '''Please remove extra blank ">" lines.'''

 . When you reply to a message Google Groups includes the message you are replying to prefixed (aka "quoted") with ">" characters.  This context helps the reader of your reply understand what the discussion is about.  The problem is that Google Groups adds a number of empty lines with nothing  but ">" characters.  For example:
 {{{
>
> When I changed it so that it said class Foo(object) it gave me
>
> a traceback error when printing out the results. Any ideas?
>
> >
>
> > The code is at http://somewhere/strange
>
}}}
 Reading a message formatted this way is annoying and there are readers who will ignore it or complain about it. You should remove the excess quoted blank lines before posting. There are several way to do this.
  1. If the quoted text is short, just removed the excess quoted blank lines by hand. (Proper netiquette requires you to remove parts of the quoted text that aren't relevant to your reply anyway which will lessen what you need to fix.)

  1. Open a New Mail Message compose window in your favorite email program. Then copy the text of the original message (not the screwed up quoted message in the Google Groups compose window) and use your email program's "Paste as quotation" function to paste into the email window. You can then copy and paste the properly quoted message back into the Google Groups post window.

  1. Do the same as above but with your favorite text editor program and use your editor's Replace function to add the quote markers yourself.
 However you do it, the context lines above should end up looking something like:
 {{{
> When I changed it so that it said class Foo(object) it gave me
> a traceback error when printing out the results. Any ideas?
>
> > The code is at http://somewhere/strange
}}}
 Please do not simply remove all the context -- in a moderate to high-volume group, context is very important to readers of your post who may have long since forgotten the message you are replying to.

2. '''Long Lines'''

Another problem with GG is that the entire paragraph typed into GG shows as one long line in other clients.  Automatic correction is possible (and will be put up here shortly). For now use the manual one â€“ enter newlines when your lines get long!

3. '''Please don't remove attributions.'''

 . Attributions are at the top of the context lines and say who posted the message(s) you are replying to.  They look like:
 {{{

4. '''Not all list readers may see your post.'''

 . Because of the above problems, the amount of spam posted via Google Groups and other reasons, there are some regular and knowledgeable list participants that filter out posts made from Google Groups. It is not clear that more than a few people do this and most posters from Google Groups get good responses. If you want every possible person to see your post you may want to try posting using one of the other methods described in CompLangPython.

5.''' Follow accepted mailing list netequitte.''' These are conventions that all posters should try to follow, they are not specific to Google Groups posters.  See for example [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_(technology)#Netiquette|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_%28technology%29#Netiquette]].  Two often complained about when ignored are:

 * Please don't top post.  Either put your reply text below any context text, not above it, or interleave your reply text within the context text by inserting each part of your reply immediately below the particular part of the context text to which it applies.

 * Remove (trim) context that is not relervant to your reply.
