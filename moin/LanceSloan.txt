This is my personal page...

I like using Python, but I don't always get as much time to do it as I would like.  There is a lot of pressure at work for me to embrace Java, so I'm doing that as much as I can for now.  Later, maybe I can inject Python into those Java projects via Jython!

My Python interests include:

 * py2app - Miro uses it to make Mac OS X apps
 * django - I'd like to start using this for web apps
 * Zope's Document Template - I use this for a couple of production web applications.  I've thought about switching to XSLT, but as my Python skills improve, I'm finding that DTML works pretty well.
 * [[MacPython/AppleScript|AppleScript]]
