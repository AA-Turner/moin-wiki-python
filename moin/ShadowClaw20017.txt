Hey There! 

As a Python programmer, I wish others to be able to learn this language as well. It's a great language, especially for beginners. It is my intention to do what I can to teach others more about Python and help them along their journey. 

As a result, I've created a Website/Blog called [[https://coderslegacy.com|CodersLegacy]] with a primary focus towards Teaching Python. We have a [[https://coderslegacy.com/learning-the-basics|Python section for beginners]] as well as an advanced section for more [[https://coderslegacy.com/python-advanced|experienced python learners]]. 

Head over to the site and begin your python journey today!
