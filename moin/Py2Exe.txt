== Discussion ==

I'm wondering: Is there something like Py2Exe, but for Linux?

We have some Python code that we'd like clients to be able to run, but we don't want them to have to install Python.

I know that Python is a required install on Red Hat 9 and up, but I don't think it is a required install on Suse, or Mandrake, or yadda yadda yadda. So, I think this would be useful. If we had somethig like Py2Exe ''for Linux,'' then we can justify using Python here at work.

The question is: Does something like this exist right now?

No, we can't require our users to install something new. Everything has to just run, right out of the box, with zero installation.


Why dont you make one yourself, it's probably not that hard...
