Python's `ConfigParser` module is part of the standard library.
The module provides a parser for simple configuration files consisting
of groups of named values.  The best known format supported by this
module is the "INI" syntax, most commonly used on the Microsoft platforms.
The module was originally written to support a variant syntax in which
the contents of each section resembled RFC 822 headers; the implementation
still allows named values to be specified using either syntax.  Between
this historical accident and lack of a clear specification of the "INI"
format has made this module very tedious to maintain, so the implementation
has been changed in almost every Python release, and the behavior of the
module has proven very tedious to describe completely.
