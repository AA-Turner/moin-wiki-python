Resources on using databases with Python

  * ChoosingDatabase -- lists databases supported by Python libraries.

  * DatabaseInterfaces -- another list of databases accessible from Python.  (Should merge this list with the above one...)

  * HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming -- wrappers that provide simpler or higher-level database interfaces, such as object/relational mappers and SQL generators.

== The DB-API ==

The DB-API is a specification for a common interface to relational databases, currently at version 2.0.

 * [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/ PEP 249: Python Database API Specification v2.0].

 * DbApiFaq
 * If you are looking for a DBAPI-2 HowTo, try [http://initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/dbapi20programming.pdf this one] (PDF).

Future development of the API:

 * DbApi3 -- discussion of possible topics for a DB-API 3.
 * ExtendingTheDbApi

Historical development:

 * [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0248/ PEP 248: Python Database API Specification v1.0].

== Resources ==

  * DatabaseBooks -- lists a few recommended titles for learning about databases.  These books aren't Python-specific.

  * [http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Databases/ Programming:Databases] category on dmoz.org

== Non-relational Databases ==

  * PersistenceTools -- describes non-relational tools for storing data on disk.
  * [http://www.matisse.com/product_information/language_bindings/lang_python.html Matisse Software] provides Python bindings for their object database.
  * [http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/ SQL Relay] is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying and load balancing system for Unix systems, supporting many different databases and languages, including PostgreSQL and Python.
