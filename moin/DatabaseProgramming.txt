Starting point for learning about using databases from Python.

== Relational Databases ==

Relational databases are the most widely used type of database, storing information as
tables containing a number of rows.

  * ChoosingDatabase -- lists databases supported by Python libraries.

  * DatabaseInterfaces -- another list of databases accessible from Python.  (Should merge this list with the above one...)

== The DB-API ==

The DB-API is a specification for a common interface to relational databases.
The current version of the specification is version 2.0.

 * [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/ PEP 249: Python Database API Specification v2.0].

 * DbApiFaq
 * [http://initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/dbapi20programming.pdf DB-API how-to] (PDF).

=== Future development ===

 * DbApi3 -- discussion of possible topics for a DB-API 3.
 * ExtendingTheDbApi

=== Historical development ===

 * [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0248/ PEP 248: Python Database API Specification v1.0].

== Related tools ==

  * HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming -- wrappers that provide simpler or higher-level database interfaces, such as object/relational mappers and SQL generators.

  * [http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/ SQL Relay] is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying and load balancing system for Unix systems, supporting many different databases and languages, including PostgreSQL and Python.

== Other resources ==

  * DatabaseBooks -- lists a few recommended titles for learning about databases.  These books aren't Python-specific.

  * [http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Databases/ Programming:Databases] category on dmoz.org

== Non-relational Databases ==

  * PersistenceTools -- describes non-relational tools for storing data on disk.

  * XmlDatabases

  * [http://www.matisse.com/product_information/language_bindings/lang_python.html Matisse Software] provides Python bindings for their object database.
