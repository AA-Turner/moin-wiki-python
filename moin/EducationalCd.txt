LinuxWiki:ThomasWaldmann has started concrete work on PythonCd (that's the main page for the wiki on the bootable CD).

Current thinking is to focus educational/scientific applications - interested beginners, include everything needed for starting

Please join the effort, there is lots of work to do!

History:

At PyCon 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.

The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a "Fat Python" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [[http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants|the python-grants list]].

See also SeaPig:PythonEducationalDistribution by the Seattle Python Interest Group.  They are creating a Windows CD.  Also, the Python EduSig list has discussed using [[http://www.morphix.org/modules/news/|Morphix]] to create a bootable custom CD.  I would encourage you to get in touch with both these groups.
