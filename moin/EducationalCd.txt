At PyCon 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.
The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a "Fat Python" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants the python-grants list].

See also SeaPig:PythonEducationalDistribution by the Seattle Python Interest Group.  They are creating a Windows CD.  Also, the Python EduSig list has discussed using [http://www.morphix.org/modules/news/ Morphix] to create a bootable custom CD.  I would encourage you to get in touch with both these groups.
