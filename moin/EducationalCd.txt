At PyCon 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.
The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a "Fat Python" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants the python-grants list].

See also SeaPig:PythonEducationalDistribution by the Seattle Python Interest Group.  They are creating a Windows CD.  Also, the Python EduSig list has discussed using [http://www.morphix.org/modules/news/ Morphix] to create a bootable custom CD.  I would encourage you to get in touch with both these groups.

ThomasWaldmann has started concrete work on PythonCd (that's the main page for the wiki on the bootable CD).

= Target =
 * Current thinking is to focus educational/scientific applications.
 * interested beginners, include everything needed for starting

= Extensions =
 * Scientific plotting applications
  * PyX
 * Numeric Python extensions

 * Databases and adapters
  * [http://gadfly.sourceforge.net/ Gadfly]
  * [http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage/ ZODB]
  * adapters for ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"] (do we then have to include the database?)
   * ''It will not be any good IMHO if not provide out of the box compatibility with MS (SQL, IIS) -- MR''

 * Web tools
  * PyXML
  * libxml2
  * other XML packages
  * ["Quixote"]
  * ["Zope"] (''imho Plone will be better -- MR'')

 * PythonApplications (written in Python)
  * GuidovanRobot (Gv``Robot) 
  * WorkforceConnections (courseware through a web interface.)
  * Chandler
  * PyGeo
  * PythonCard
  * Shtoom
  * PyGE http://pyge.sourceforge.net/
  * QuantLib  (http://quantlib.sourceforge.net/)
  * VPython
  * PyChecker - for checking python src code
  * PyAC # album creator

 * Fun Stuff
  * movies - as far as space allows:
   * Yoda
   * Love Story
   * [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/multimedia/video/obp/IntroducingPython.mpg Introducing Python Movie] ''mpg'' ''Huge File Warning! 238 MB''
  * background image (Python with batteries included in 1024x768?)

There are some ready to go apps like 
 * library automation
 * Plone based school setup
that may show something good out of the box. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2004-04-09T18:59:28Z)]]
