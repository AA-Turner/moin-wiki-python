At PyCon 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.
The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a "Fat Python" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants the python-grants list].

See also SeaPig:PythonEducationalDistribution by the Seattle Python Interest Group.  They are creating a Windows CD.  Also, the Python EDU-SIG list has discussed using [http://www.morphix.org/modules/news/ Morphix] to create a bootable custom CD.  I would encourage you to get in touch with both these groups.

Here's a quick (incomplete and biased by my bookmark file) 
list of example things that might be included in the "Fat Python".
Current thinking is to focus educational/scientific applications.

	* Core Python distribution
	* GUI toolkit bindings
		* PyGtk
		* WxPython
		* PyQt
		* Others?
	* Scientific plotting applications
                * PyX
	* Numeric Python extensions
        * Image processing
                * ["PIL"]
                * PyAlbum
	* Documentation
		* Python Docs
		* Free Python Books (IntroductoryBooks, AdvancedBooks?)
                        * [http://www.network-theory.co.uk/python/manual/pytut.pdf An Introduction to Python] by GvR
			* [http://DiveIntoPython.org]
		* Tutorials and FAQ on PyGtk
		* John Miller's Thesis

== Other Ideas ==

	* Databases and adapters
		* [http://gadfly.sourceforge.net/ Gadfly]
	        * [http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage/ ZODB]
		* adapters for ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"] (do we then have to include the database?)
                       * ''It will not be any good IMHO if not provide out of the box compatibility with MS (SQL, IIS) -- MR''
	* Editors & GUI Builders
		* WxGlade
                * BoaConstructor
                * how about [http://die-offenbachs.de/detlev/eric3.html Eric3]?
	* Web tools
		* PyXML
		* libxml2
		* other XML packages
		* ["Quixote"]
		* ["Zope"] (''imho Plone will be better -- MR'')

	* PythonApplications (written in Python)
		* GuidovanRobot (Gv``Robot) 
		* WorkforceConnections (courseware through a web interface.)
		* Chandler
		* PyGeo
		* PythonCard
		* Shtoom
		* PyGE http://pyge.sourceforge.net/
		* QuantLib  (http://quantlib.sourceforge.net/)

There are some ready to go apps like 
 * library automation
 * Plone based school setup
that may show something good out of the box. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2004-04-09T18:59:28Z)]]
