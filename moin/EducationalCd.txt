At PyCon 2004, a BoF discussed ways to get grant money for Python development.
The initial target of the funding requests will be for the development of a "Fat Python" distribution. This will take the form of a bootable CDROM. The application on the CD will cover a variety of educational topics, in addition to teaching introductory computer programming. We plan to develop a demo version of the CDROM in parallel with writing a grant request for funding.

This project is discussed on [http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-grants the python-grants list].


= Possible Contents =

Here's a quick (incomplete and biased by my bookmark file) 
list of example things that might be included in the "Fat Python".
Current thinking is to focus educational/scientific applications.

	* Core Python distribution
	* GUI toolkit bindings
		* PyGtk
		* wxPython
		* PyQt
		* Others?
	* Scientific plotting applications
	* Numeric Python extensions
	* Documentation
		* Python Docs
		* Free Python Books
			???
		* Tutorials and FAQ on PyGtk
		* John Miller's Thesis

== Other Ideas ==

	* Databases and adapters
		* Gadfly
	        * ZODB
		* adapters for MySQL, PostGres??? (do we then have to include the database?)
	* Editors & GUI Builders
		* Glade

	* Web tools
		* PyXML
		* libxml2
		* other XML packages
		* Quixote
		* Zope

	* Applications written in Python
		* GvRobot
		* WorkforceConnections (courseware through a web interface.)
		* Chandler
		* PyGeo
		* PythonCard
		* Shtoom
		* PyGE http://pyge.sourceforge.net/
		* QuantLib  (http://quantlib.sourceforge.net/)
