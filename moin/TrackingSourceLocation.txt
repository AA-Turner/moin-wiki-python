The CPython interpreter currently tracks the source location of a code object in the co_filename attribute. In certain cases, this is a relative file name, which may break if the current directory changes. The objective of this project is to make sure that co_filename is always an absolute path, or to allow otherwise to infer the original location of the source file. In addition, if the module was imported from a byte code file, a mechanism should be provided to also find out what that byte code file was.
