== Charles Thayer ==
Charles Thayer has been using python since the July 2001 at [http://www.tapstone.com Tapstone Inc.]
which was a spin-off from [http://www.teleias.com/ Teleias International].  The product provides
an infrastructure for managing lots of machines (both Unix and NT) in large enterprises.
Charles plays the roles of manager, system architect, and developer.  

Favorite python modules
include xml, xmlrpc, jpy (Judo / Jabber), and asyncore.

For more info see [http://thayer.b2si.com/ Charles Thayer's Homepage] which has a Wiki
with python code tidbits.  Feel free to email questions about python.
