=== What Can I Do for PyCon? ===

Matt Payne asked me what he could do for PyCon. I came up with a few ideas and, rather than just communicate them privately, I thought I'd use the dynamic nature of the Wiki to throw these out to anybody who might be asking the same question. I'd like to thank Matt for stimulating me to express my ambitions for the conference more clearly -- ''steve''

Please think about how you can assist the conference, using the points below as a focus, and make up your mind not to simply be a passive consumer at PyCon. The more people who ''get involved'' the more fun (and the more rewarding) the conference will be.  Consult the list of PyConTasks and see what you can do.

Remember: '''this is a Wiki: ''you'' can edit this (and other) pages'''. Your contributions are vital to the conference's success. If you simply want to sign up to help in a particular area, put your name below the appropriate area. We will also need some way to reach you, so an email address would be helpful.

Well, before PyCon:

  * You could help design mechanisms that make sure the audience's interests are reflected in the presentations.

  * You could encourage favorite Python authors or contributors to submit a paper by suggesting topics you'd find interesting.

  * You could write a paper of your own.

  * You could write a lightning talk.

  * You could make suggestions on this and related pages to make sure the conference better suits your needs.

  * You could organize one or more Wiki pages for use in preparing a Jython track (PyConJython?).

  * You could encourage others to contribute to that Wiki, and/or establish other Wiki areas to indicate support for and possibly even sponsorship of particular topics.

  * You could publicize the conference anywhere and everywhere relevant.  (See the PyConPromotion page.)

  * You could move to DC :-).

  * You could think about all the administrivia that's need to run a friendly and professional conference and produce checklists, liaise with suppliers, suggest sources.

  * You could help to get the papers ready for publication on the web.

  * You could help to prepare brochures and circulate them.

  * You could locate low-cost accommodation in the area and publicize it with transportation options. PyConTransportationOptions

During PyCon:

  * You could help out at the registration desk.

  * You could help to build, operate and tear down the wireless infrastructure we are putting in place to keep everybody up on the Internet.

  * You could make sure that speakers are ready to speak, with viewgraphs and handouts as appropriate.

  * You could run a BoF (birds-of-a-feather) session or three.

  * You could make sure that extempore sessions were recorded.

  * You could organize transport sharing to help conferees to keep costs down.

  * You could monitor the accommodation position for late arrivals.

  * You could put a task force together to organize the *next* PyCon.

  * You could offer me a free place :-)

  * You could bring an FRS radio (e.g. Motorola Talkabout) to assist with conference communications.
