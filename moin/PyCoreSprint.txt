Four of the guys from Pythonlabs are going to be at the sprint on plan on sprint on *something*.  This is all being led by Guido, but he is busy and has no specific ideas of what to sprint on.  If you have any, please list them below.

 * Close as many bugs on SF as possible.

 * Implement one of the namespace speed-up PEPs ([http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0266.html 266], [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0267.html 267], or [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0280.html 280]) or anything else to help prevent Guido from getting a pie in the face.  =)

 * My pet bug is reliable signal handling when using event loops like PyGTK. I think an extra C-level hook in the core would make it possible to do this right. (At the moment, SIGINT/KeyboardInterrupt is blocked until python regains control). I'd be interested in participating in an effort to fix this one.  - PyConBrianWarner

 * Free threading (which has been asked for almost as long as namespace speed-ups :-) - Thomas Wouters)

 * Work on the AST branch (will make Jeremy happy  =)

 * Fix rexec. (I happen to think it has potential and is worth saving). - Brian Warner

 * Fully document classes, both classic and new-style
 
 * make _p_changed=1 after changing a list or a dictionary unnecessary (ZODB) - Thomas Guettler <guettli@thomas-guettler.de>

 * Implement CALL_ATTR to speed up method calling

 * Make the profiler support threads

 * Implement a new I/O library

 * Start work on new sockets interface as mentioned by Guido on python-dev (email at http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-March/034042.html )

Sprinters so far:

 * Guido van Rossum (coach)

 * Jeremy Hylton

 * Tim Peters

 * Brett Cannon

 * Ka-Ping Yee

 * Thomas Wouters

 * Neil Schemenauer

 * Aahz

 * Neal Norwitz


Projects chosen so far:

 * CALL_ATTR (Thomas, Brett)

 * speed up new-class instance attribute lookup using a cache (Ping, Aahz)

 * AST branch (Jeremy, Tim, Neil)
