[http://www.activestate.com/Products/Productivity/ASPN_Komodo/ Komodo] from ActiveState is a rich IDE for Python, Perl, and XSLT.  It is really good.

The current version 3 is in Beta (as of July 4, 2004) and pretty solid.  I suggest you grab it while its available.  I expect the Beta will be good enough to use that you may not bother upgrading - especially for hobby use.  Check the license agreement.
