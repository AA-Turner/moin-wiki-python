A framework for WebProgramming.
=== Masthead ===

   URL:: http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/paste/wareweb/docs/wareweb.txt
   version:: No released version (just svn checkouts)
   licence:: PSF
   platforms:: WSGI
   Python versions:: 2.4+

=== Deployment Platforms ===

A WSGI-based framework, intended to be used under [http://pythonpaste.org/ Paste].

=== Suitability ===

All-purpose framework.

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

These aspects (and others) are handled by framework-neutral WSGI middleware included in Paste.
In other cases (like persistence) general-purpose Python libraries should be used.

=== Presentation Support ===

Includes its own minimal event framework, and metaclass protocol, to make plugins/components fairly
simple and general.  In this case, a plugin can be written to handle templating.  Only
one such templating language is supported currently, in [http://imagescape.com/software/ZPTKit/ ZPTKit].

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Wareweb is a refactoring of the programming model of ["Webware"].  It's intended to keep the same conceptual
model (servlets), while natively including extensions (like [http://wiki.w4py.org/component.html Component],
and removing some aspects of Webware that were never flushed out.

It also removes the inheritance hierarchy (there's just one Servlet class), removes request and response
objects (their functions are included in servlets natively), and separates out Webware's special dispatching
on _action_ into a separate component (of which multiple dispatchers are available).

=== Comments ===

=== Hosting ===

This can be used anywhere Paste can be used, and in turn anywhere WSGI is available.  If necessary it can be run as a CGI script, though this tends to be slow.
