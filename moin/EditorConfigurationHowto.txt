Python's syntax requires special handling in the construction of a Python-mode. Two issues are particular to Python:Fart

=== Indentation ===

Python uses indentation to group statements. A well designed mode should offer support for smart indentation of code. For example, a line beginning with the keywork def and ending with : should cause the editor to indent the following line upon hitting of the return key.

Code examples or references on how to deal with indentation should follow.

=== Strings ===

Python supports three types of string literals. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes (") and in groups of three single or double quotes (and are then referred to as triple-quoted strings). A well designed mode should support all three types. In particular, a mode should correctly recognize that triple-quoted strings can include unescaped newlines and quotes.
