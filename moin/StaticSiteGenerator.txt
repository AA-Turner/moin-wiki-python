Static site generator is a software that takes some '''text + [[Templating|templates]]''' as input and produces '''html files''' on the output. A picture:

{{{
   ┌──────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌─────────────┐ **
   │ text │ + │ templates │ = │ .html files │
   └──────┘   └───────────┘   └─────────────┘
}}}

Generated site can be [[http://www.jeffknupp.com/|blog]], [[http://osgameclones.com/|game list]], [[http://interactive.blockdiag.com/|interactive demo]] or anything else.
