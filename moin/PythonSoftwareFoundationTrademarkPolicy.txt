This is a *DRAFT* -- please contact the PSF board when in doubt.

"Python" is a registered trademark, and the Python logo is a trademark, of the Python Software Foundation.

With all trademarks, there are legally defined limits for what is and is not acceptible use of the trademark.  It falls to the owner of these marks, the Python Software Foundation, to determine their acceptable use.

If you are thinking of using "Python" the word mark or the Python logo, please read the following guidelines for acceptible use of these marks:

== Acceptible Use ==

  * The word mark "Python" and the Python logo may be used when referring directly to the Python programming language, its standard libraries, documentation; or third party modules, tools, documentation, or other resources for the Python programming language.

  * The Python logo may be used on websites, brochures, promotional materials, packaging, and other contexts if it is being used to convey a connection to the Python programming language.  Specifically:

    * In conjunction with "Python Inside", "Supports Python", "Powered by Python", or with similar remarks or intention
    * To represent Python in a menu of choices.

  * The logo may be used on T-shirts, websites, or other materials produced by Python user groups or for Python conferences.  Such materials bearing the logo may not be sold at a profit without first obtaining permission from the Python Software Foundation.

== Unacceptible Use ==

  * The Python trademarks may not be used for anything related to programming languages or software development that are not the Python programming language.

  * The Python logo, or any derivative of the Python logo, may not be used for third party modules, tools, documentation, or other resources for Python except by permission from the Python Software Foundation.  Such permission ''may'' be given for other open source implementations of Python; for tools or modules directly associated with Python, such as PyPI (the Python Package Index) and the Python wiki; and for Python conferences, Python user groups, and so forth.

== How to Use the Trademarks ==

  * The first use of the word mark "Python" in any use should be immediately followed by the symbol for registered trademarks: "®" or "(r)".  For example "Python® ..."

  * The Python logo should be accompanied by the symbol for unregistered trademarks: "™" or a small "TM" in the lower right

  * If the word mark "Python" or logo are used, a statement should accompany its use:

   ''"Python" and the Python logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Python Software Foundation''
  
  * Use of the ®, (r), ™, or TM symbols and the above statement is required on websites, in brochures and other promotional material, printed documentation, and in commercial uses.  It is not required for informal use such as in wikis and email, in academic papers, and in most non-commercial contexts such as websites and documentation for open source projects.

We encourage the use of these symbols because they help to strengthen the trademark, which in turn helps to strengthen the intellectual property rights behind Python, which in turn helps the Python Software Foundation in its efforts to keep Python free and clear of external claims.
