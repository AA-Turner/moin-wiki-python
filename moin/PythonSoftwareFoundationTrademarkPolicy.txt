This is a *DRAFT* -- please contact the PSF board when in doubt.

"Python" is a registered trademark.  The Python logo is also a trademark, although it has not yet been registered officially since it is very new.

As for all trademarks, there are legally defined limits for what is and is not acceptible use of the trademark.  It falls to the Python Software Foundation, which owns these marks, to police their use.  Failing to do so may cause the trademarks to become diluted or legally invalid.

If you are thinking of using "Python" the word mark or the Python logo, please read the following general guidelines for acceptible use of these marks:

== Acceptible Use ==

  * The word mark "Python" and the logo may be used when referring directly to the Python programming language, its standard libraries, documentation, or third party modules, tools, documentation, or other resources for the Python programming language.

  * The Python logo may be used on websites, brochures, promotional materials, packaging, and other contexts if it is being used to convey a connection to the Python programming language.  Specifically:

    * In conjunction with "Python Inside", "Supports Python", "Powered by Python", or with similar remarks or intention
    * To represent Python in a menu of choices.

  * The logo may be used on T-shirts, websites, or other materials produced by Python users groups or for Python conferences.  If materials bearing the logo are sold at a profit, we encourage donation of the profits to the Python Software Foundation or similar organization associated with a Python conference or Python user group.

== Unacceptible Use ==

  * The Python trademarks may not be used for things that are not the Python programming language.  An exception to this rule is that the word mark may be used for things that are not Python '''and''' that have nothing to do with software development or programming languages (these are legally outside of the domain where the word mark "Python" applies).

  * The Python logo, or any derivative of the Python logo, may not be used for third party modules, tools, documentation, or other resources for Python except by permission from the Python Software Foundation.  Cases where permission may be given will be for other open source implementations of Python, for tools or modules directly associated with Python, such as PyPI (the Python Package Index) and the Python wiki, and for Python conferences, Python user groups, and so forth.

== How to Use the Trademarks ==

  * The first use of the word mark "Python" in any use should be accompanied by the symbol for registered trademarks:  (r) or a lower case "r" inside a circle (sorry I have no idea how to make this wiki show that!)

  * The Python logo should be accompanied by the symbol for unregistered trademarks:  a small TM in the lower right (again, I don't know how to make this wiki show the right symbol!)

  * If the word mark "Python" or logo are used, a statement should accompany its use stating:

   ''"Python" and the Python logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Python Software Foundation''
  
  * Use of the (r) and TM symbols and the above statement is required on websites, in brochures and other promotional material, printed documentation, and in most other commercial uses.  It is not required for informal use such as in wikis and email or in academic papers.  It is also not required in most non-commercial contexts, although we encourage the use of these symbols because they help to strengthen the trademark, which in turn helps to strengthen the intellectual property rights behind Python, which in turn helps the Python Software Foundation in its efforts to keep Python free and clear of external claims.
