"Python" is a registered trademark, and the Python logo is a trademark, of the Python Software Foundation.

With all trademarks there are legally defined limits for what is and is not acceptable use of the trademark.  It falls to the owner of these marks, the Python Software Foundation, to determine their acceptable use. The Foundation wishes to ensure that all uses of its trademarks, whether registered or not, observe the Foundation's acceptable use policies.

If you are thinking of using "Python" the word mark or the Python logo, please read the following guidelines for acceptable uses of these marks:

== Acceptable Uses ==

  * The word mark "Python" and the Python logo may be used when referring directly to the Python programming language, its standard libraries, and documentation.

  * The Python logo may be used on websites, brochures, promotional materials, packaging, and other contexts if it is being used to convey a connection to the Python programming language.  Specifically:

    * In conjunction with "Python Inside", "Supports Python", "Powered by Python", or with similar remarks or intention

    * To represent the Python programming language in a menu of choices

  * The logo may be used on T-shirts, websites, or other materials produced by Python user groups or for Python conferences.  Such materials bearing the logo may not be sold at a profit without first obtaining written permission from the Python Software Foundation.

== Unacceptable Uses ==

  * The Python trademarks may not be used for anything unrelated to  the Python programming language.

  * The Python logo, or any derivative of the Python logo, may not be used for third party modules, tools, documentation, or other resources for Python without written permission from the Python Software Foundation.  Such permission ''may'' be given for other open source implementations of the Python programming language; for tools or modules directly associated with the Python programming language, such as PyPI (the Python Package Index) and the Python wiki; and for Python conferences, Python user groups, and so forth.

== How to Use the Trademarks ==

  * The first use of the word mark "Python" in any use should be immediately followed by the symbol for registered trademarks: "®" or "(r)".  For example "Python® ..."

  * The Python logo should be accompanied by the symbol for unregistered trademarks: "™" or a small "TM" in the lower right

  * If the word mark "Python" or logo are used, a statement should accompany its use:

   ''"Python" and the Python logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Python Software Foundation''
  
  * Use of the ®, (r), ™, or TM symbols and the above statement is required on websites, in brochures and other promotional material, printed documentation, and in commercial uses.  It is not required for informal use such as in wikis and email, in academic papers, and in most non-commercial contexts such as websites and documentation for open source projects.

We encourage the use of these symbols because they help to strengthen the trademark, which in turn helps to strengthen the intellectual property rights behind the Python programming language, which in turn helps the Python Software Foundation in its efforts to keep Python free and clear of external claims.

== Examples ==

This list of examples is tentative and intended to facilitate discussion on what cases should and should not be allowed and
how the mark should be used in each case.  There are basically three classes of trademark uses here:

  1) Use of the word "Python" in text or 3rd party logos and trademarks

  2) Use of the unaltered logo including the stylized "python" letters and other similar logos (like "Python Powered", "Python Inside", etc) created and distributed by the PSF.

  3) Use of a logo derived from the Python logo -- for example, use of the snake logo part but with different text, or with no text, or in combination with other graphic elements.

'''PLEASE EXPAND ON THE DRAFT LISTS BELOW'''

=== Use of "Python" ===

  * Use of "Python" in product names like ActivePython, IronPython, Wing IDE for Python, etc -- ?  (in general the "for Python" form is allowed for trademarks but some trademark policies like Mozilla's disallow names like "XXX Python" or "Python XXX"; not sure how to formulate this part of the policy)

  * Use of "Python" in the name of user groups and conferences -- Always allowed for affliates, otherwise by permission only

  * Use of "Python" in the name of books or publication like "Python Journal" and "Python Cookbook" -- ?

  * Use of "Python" on websites, brochures, documentation, and product packaging -- Must include (r) symbol.  Commercial websites and documentation must include the trademark statement.  All websites and documentation are encouraged to include the trademark statement.

  * Use of "Python" in advertisements -- Allowed w/o (r) ?

  * Use of "Python" in email -- Allowed w/o (r).
