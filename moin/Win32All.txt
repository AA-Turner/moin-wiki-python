Win32All is a package that includes all the extensions for accessing the Win32 API.
The package contains the Python Win32Extensions, the Python COM interface and PythonWin.

Mark Hammond created these extensions, and later maintained them while working at ActiveState.
After losing his job there, he has moved the [http://starship.python.net/crew/skippy/win32/ download page] back to the Python Starship.
