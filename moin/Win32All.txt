PyWin32 (previously "Win32All") is a package that includes extensions for accessing the Win32 API, Windows COM bindings (e.g. modules like "win32api", "win32com", etc.) and the PythonWin IDE.

Mark Hammond created these extensions, and later maintained them while working at ActiveState. These exetensions are now hosted at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ Sourceforge].

Information on the Python-win32 mailing list can be found [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-win32 here].
