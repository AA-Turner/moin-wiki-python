= Python needs speakers! =

Organizers of Python user groups and regional conferences need help finding speakers to pull together great events and grow the Python community.  Help them find you!

If you're willing and able to speak on Python topics, please add an entry for yourself here.  This isn't a firm commitment to present, but allows organizers to contact you.  Please include at least the following information:

 * Your name, with a link to contact information

 * Your geographical location

 * Geographical area you can appear in

 * Topics you can speak on

Please put your information all on one line (even if it's a long line) - that helps people cut/pasting it into spreadsheets, etc.
