This page is a collection point for people to post links to IDLE extension modules that they have written themselves.

[[http://idlex.sourceforge.net|IdleX]] provides a large collection of extensions to improve IDLE. 
 * Terminal.py - This extension makes the Shell behave more like a terminal. The cursor stays at the prompt and up/down arrow keys the navigate the command history. 
 * !RunSelection.py - Runs highlighted code or a single line in the editor by pressing F9.
 * !TabExtension.py - Provides tabbed editing support. This extension also allows for drag'n'drop reordering of tabs. On Linux, the mouse wheel allows for scrolling of the Tabs.
 * !LineNumbers.py - Provides a panel for displaying line numbers in the editor.
 * !PastePyShell.py - Allows for intelligent copy and paste of Shell contents into the editor. Prompts ('>>>') are removed and non-code gets commented.
 * !SubCode.py - Provides cell-mode-like functionality similar to MATLAB and Sagemath. !SubCode allows the programmer to separate a script into blocks for execution in the shell without restarting. This allows for iterative and rapid prototyping of code.
 * !SubCodeToolbar.py - Provides a toolbar for using !SubCode.py. The toolbar allows for arithmetic modification of numbers within subcodes, as well as a listing of subcode labels.
 * !CythonScript.py - Provides basic Cython support, including syntax highlighting and executing a .pyx script via Ctrl+E. Refer to the demos directory.
 * !ReindentExtension.py -Applies the core of reindent.py to the source code in an editor window by selecting "Apply Reindent" under the Format menu. 
 * !TabHighlight.py - Highlights all instances of \t in an editor to help with fixing tab/space errors with Python code. Toggle under the Options menu.
 * !CodeBrowser.py - An alternative to the built-in Class Browser. A simple overlay displays all class' and def's in the editor. Clicking on a line jumps to it in the source code. Press F8 to toggle the code browser, as well as clicking "Code Browser" in the status bar.
 * Horizontal.py - Provides a horizontal scroll bar for the editor. Can be toggled using "Show Horizontal Scrollbar" under the "Windows" menu. 
 * !EventLoop.py - Allows GUI toolkits to function while using the IDLE subprocess. This extension makes IDLE's event loop drive a toolkit event loop periodically. (Also allows Matplotlib to work with IDLE's subprocess.)
 * !PersistentHistory.py - Saves and restores the history of commands entered in the Shell between sessions.
 * !ClearWindow.py - This provides "Clear Shell Window" under "Options" with the ability to undo. Use Ctrl+L as a shortcut.
 * Squeezer.py - Originally developed by Noam Raphael and maintained by Tal Einat. "Using this extension will make long texts become a small button." 
 * !SearchBar.py - Originally developed by Tal Einat. Provides a redesign of the Find and Replace dialogs as toolbars at the bottom on the editor. Incremental searching supported.
 * IDLE2HTML.py - Originally developed by Michael Haubenwallner. Export the contents of an editor or shell as color-highlighted HTML. 


Alias: enhances IDLE's command-line with an alias facility and more. Download @ [[lwickjr]].

Edit: an edit command for Alias that attempts to invoke the IDLE editor on the source code of the object refrenced on the command line. Download @ [[lwickjr]].
