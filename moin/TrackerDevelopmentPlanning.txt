Workflow
========

Other features
==============

Patch-related improvements
--------------------------

When a file is submitted the tracker should be able to:

* Determine if the file is a patch or not;
* Determine what files are affected by the patch (and possibly add the module/package names as tags);
* Determine if the patch contains tests, docs, Misc/NEWS entry, Misc/ACKS, etc.;
* Determine if the patch contains trailing whitespace or PEP 8 violations;
* Determine on which branches the patches apply on without conflicts (with a way to re-check it on demand or periodically);

User Interface
==============

* Add a dashboard page similar to https://dashboard.djangoproject.com/  (global + per user?);
* Show the role of users (normal user, developer/triager, committer) with an icon or tooltip;
* Show a "clip" icon in the issue list page for issues with a patch;
