Hi,

Sprint participants, meet the other sprint participants. :)

This is a reminder that we'll be sprinting at PyCon this
coming Monday and Tuesday.  We'll start at 9am both days.
I don't know how late we'll be able to stay in the rooms.
We'll have to play that by ear. I hope we can make these
somewhat long days.

The sprint will be at the same location as the rest of the conference.
We don't know the exact room yet, so you need to show up a little
early on Monday to allow a little extra time to find the room.

I'll start by giving the Zope 3 programmer's tutorial. I'm going
to try and do this pretty quickly (say 2-3 hours), since we
only have two days to sprint.  We'll then probably spend an hour or
two in discussions before we actually commense sprinting.

The focus of this sprint will be I18n.  If anyone really prefers to
work on something else, please let me know.  I'd like Stephan and
Barry to plan to spend some time summarizing the status of I18n
support in Zope and Python. (Stephan and Barry, I'll have a projector
if you want to use slides.)  You should also review:

-
http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/I18nFormatLocaleSupport

-
http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/ZPTInternationalizationSupport

-  
http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/UnicodeForText

- http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/lib/module-gettext.html

My goals for the sprint:

- Review and refine the existing I18n interfaces used for Zope 3

- Create an example Zope 3 application that demonstrates use of the
  I18n facilities. We'll probably build on an existing "job board"
  application.

  Write a tutorial around the sample application.

- Implement facilities to support internationalization of strings in Zope
  schema and zope configuration markup language.

I look forward to seeing you Monday Morning!

Jim
