= Welcome to JAM's Wiki Page =

Hello!  My name is JAM.  I am rather new to the Python programming language, but I still can write some simple programs using it.  I hope to learn more about the Python programming language through this Wiki.

I will try to support the Python programming language the best that I can.  I have researched several programming languages and have found that Python is '''very''' flexible.  I think that it is going to become very important as computers advance.  With its communications modules, it could very well become a driving language behind the Information Super-Highway.

You can now email me at jam555691@yahoo.com.  You can also chat with me using your Yahoo! Instant messanger if I'm online.
