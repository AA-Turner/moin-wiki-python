= Django Meeting NL =

Django meeting is a Dutch meeting for Django users, intended for both professionals and hobbyists alike. Our aim is to support interaction between all Dutch Django users and to be a platform for information exchange.

= Language =

To improve accessibility for speakers of all foreign languages, meetings will be held in English. It is possible for an occasional presentation to be in Dutch.

Als je een presentatie in het Nederlands wilt geven, ben je net zo welkom! De meeste toehoorders zullen Nederlands verstaan.

= Meetings =

Our first meeting will be held in probably November, in the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam. We'd like to hold an informal poll who is willing to attend. If you are interested, please leave your name here. Thank you very much!
