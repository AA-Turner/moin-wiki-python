SciTe is based on the SCIntilla editor engine. Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for building and running programs. Plug-in suport for Python API (there is script which create description of all Python API on your computer), the best syntax highlighting, work on Linux, Solaris, Win family.
Get it from http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html

I'm also using it, not only for Python :) It highlights JSP pages verry good too (best IMHO).
Does anybody know a way to use SciTE for Python debugging?
