Aquarium is a Web application framework written in Python. It's features were inspired by a broad range of Web technologies (such as PHP's FreeTrade, Java's Struts, Perl's Mason, and Python's Zope). It offers convenient libraries (such as session management), tight integration with Cheetah (including autocompilation of Cheetah templates), adaptors for various Web environments (including CGI, mod_python, and custom Web servers), and a convenient approach to Web development (the FreeEnergy methodology). Most of all, it's compact (just a few thousand lines of code) and extremely well documented. Aquarium is a useful tool for creating any highly-dynamic, custom Web application written in Python.

Aquarium is based around these ideas:

    * Web applications can be thought of as a combination of a bunch of different types of modules. Aquarium serves as the framework for dynamically tying all of these modules together.
    * The main request flow of an application involves a controller that does work and produces data. That data is passed off to a view that displays that data. See aquarium.screen.ScreenAPI for more on this.
    * A view's superclass should take care of layout details automatically. In fact, a view should not need to do anything other than declare who it is subclassing (who you subclass and how many layers there are in the class hiearchy should not require you to change the name of your main method). See aquarium.layout.LayoutAPI for more on this.
