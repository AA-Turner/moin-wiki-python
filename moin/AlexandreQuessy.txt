I am mostly into web sites and Dataflow programming. My main interest in the Python language is to create web services extensions to Pure Data, a real-time graphical programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing. That's what I mean by « dataflow programming ». See http://www.puredata.info/ for more informations.
