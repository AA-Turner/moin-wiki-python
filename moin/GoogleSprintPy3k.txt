= Python 3000 Goals for the Google Sprint =

Here are some possible tasks for the Py3k portion of the GoogleSprint.

To claim a task, please add your name to it.

 * Unify int/long (see recent email in python-3000 list; Martin von Lowis???)

 * Work on the new I/O library (I have much interest in this but need help -- Guido)

 * When the I/O library is ready, start unifying str/unicode.

 * Rewrite import in Python (Brett Cannon?)

 * Rip out the last remains of coerce

 * Rip out classic classes (already done; Guido)

 * Make it so that __hash__ can be set to None to declare an unhashable type, and to automatically do this the first time __eq__ or __cmp__ are overridden but __hash__ is not (Guido; could use help)

 * Implement PEP 3102 (Jiwon Seo?)

 * See PEP 3100 for more ideas
