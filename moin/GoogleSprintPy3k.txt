= Python 3000 Goals for the Google Sprint =

Here are some possible tasks for the Py3k portion of the GoogleSprint.

To claim a task, please add your name to it.

 * Fix various unit tests that are currently failing in the p3yk (sic) branch (all done).

 * Unify int/long (see recent email in python-3000 list; Martin von LÃ¶wis???)

 * Get rid of all references to file() in favor of open().
Anna has checked through Lib/g*.py and found no file() references that need to be changed. (only use of file in those are in docstrings or as variable names.) Anna will continue tomorrow on this task. (AMR)

 * Work on the new I/O library (I have much interest in this but need help -- Guido)

 * When the I/O library is ready, start unifying str/unicode.

 * Rewrite import in Python (Brett Cannon?, Alex Martelli?,
   Osvaldo Santana)

 * Rip out the last remains of coerce (Done, need to rename nb_coerce slot)

 * Put back nb_ <true division> slots (regular and augmented)

 * Rip out classic classes (already done; Guido)

 * Make it so that __hash__ can be set to None to declare an unhashable type, and to automatically do this the first time __eq__ or __cmp__ are overridden but __hash__ is not (done)

 * Implement PEP PEP:3102 (keyword-only arguments) (Jiwon Seo?)

 * Py3kConversionTools: Work on tool to help convert (flag keywords like with/as, removed functions/methods:  apply/{}.iter*/{}.has_key/etc) (Jeremy Hylton)

 * See PEP PEP:3100 for more ideas

 * Make zip() an iterator (like itertools.izip())

 * Make map() and filter() iterators and make them stop at the end of the shortest input (like zip()) instead of at the end of the longest input (like itertools?)

 * Rip out reduce() (done -- John Reese and Jacques Frechet)

 * Make xrange() support longs; then rename it to range() (see http://www.python.org/sf/1472639 for all but the supporting-long part) (Neal)

 * Kill uses of has_key() in idlelib (John R & Jacques F).
