stub page - intend to expand with an example full test suite, as written in PyUnit.

http://pyunit.sourceforge.net 

reference http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html#USING

This page will just show a simple example, alone, and then point the user to the full tutorial.

The online book [http://www.diveintopython.org/toc/index.html Dive into Python] has a chapter on unit testing in python with PyUnit.
