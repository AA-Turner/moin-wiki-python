We are in the process of planning the BoulderSprint, which we hope to hold on a regular basis.

== Meeting, October 18, 2006 == 

 * Discussed possible proposals for PyCon2007. The basic consensus was that it was a great idea that for PyCon "we're especially interested in presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful." In particular, we all would like to see talks with more useful takeaway code, not just talks saying, hey we are doing great things with Python. Trust us :). 

 * Began planning of BoulderSprint, which apparently has been a burning desire for JimBaker for a while.
