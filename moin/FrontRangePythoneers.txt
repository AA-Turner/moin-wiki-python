We are in the process of planning the BoulderSprint, which we hope to hold on a regular basis. We also hold a monthly meeting.

There has been talk of helping pair mentors with aspiring Pythoneers. If you are so aspirationally inclined, please contact us!

 * Discussed possible proposals for PyCon2007. The basic consensus was that it was a great idea that for PyCon "we're especially interested in presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful." In particular, we all would like to see talks with more useful takeaway code, not just talks saying, hey we are doing great things with Python. Trust us :).

 * Began planning of BoulderSprint, which apparently has been a burning desire for JimBaker for a while.

= Events =

 * BoulderSprint.

 * BoulderJam, an opportunity to try out interesting technologies together.

Lots of great things happening in the Front Range. More to be filled in here...
