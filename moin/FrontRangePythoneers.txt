= About Us =

The Front Range Pythoneers is an active Python users group in Boulder, Colorado, USA.

= Activities =

We hold a regular monthly meeting every third Wednesday. We also hold a regular monthly sprint, usually on the first Saturday of each month.  The next sprints will by on Jython and !IPython1, an update of the popular python shell. At this point, it looks like we will be holding these sprints on a regular basis.

Future possibilities include holding an occasional BoulderJam to play with an exciting new technology together, and helping pair mentors with aspiring Pythoneers.

= Mailing List =

You can subscribe to our [http://lists.community.tummy.com/mailman/listinfo/frpythoneers mailing list]. We also have a [http://lists.community.tummy.com/pipermail/frpythoneers/ mail archive].

= Meetings and Sprints =

We just happen to have the friendliest bunch of Python people coming to our meetings. So why not come too?

 * Date/time: Every 3rd Wednesday, 6-8 PM. Calendars [http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/frpythoneers%40gmail.com/public/basic XML] [http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/frpythoneers%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics ICAL] [http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=frpythoneers%40gmail.com  HTML]

 * Location: watch this space, our emails, and other announcements, because it's been changing from meeting to meeting recently. The next location returns to bivio Software.

Sprints are usually held the 1st Saturday of each month, also at bivio.

== Next Sprint: February 3, 2007 ==

 * JythonSprint. Part of our BoulderSprint series. Topic TBD.

 * Location: [http://www.bivio.biz/ bivio Software, Inc.], 28th and Iris. Above Hair Elite in Suite S. [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=2701+Iris+Ave.,+Boulder+CO&ie=UTF8&z=15&om=1&iwloc=A Google Maps link]

== PyCon: February 23-25, 2007 ==

== !IPython Sprint: April 6, 2007 ==

 * [http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Developer_Zone/Sprint IPython1 Beta]. This would be an excellent opportunity to learn about decorators, Twisted, and other advanced Python concepts while helping getting this shell to beta status.

= Previous Events =

== Meeting: January 17, 2007 ==

 * Location: [http://www.churchillnavigation.com Churchill Navigation], 100 Arapahoe Ave, Suite 10, all the way at the end, in Boulder, Colorado. [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=100+Arapahoe+Ave,+Suite+10+Boulder+CO+80302&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=40.012792,-105.297904&spn=0.017289,0.05064&om=1&iwloc=addr Google Maps link]. There is abundant parking.

Topics and people attending include the following:

 * BoulderSprint. We had a great JythonSprint, focusing on design. Momentum is really building, Jython might actually get the love that Charles Oliver Nutter of !JRuby proposed. More interestingly, there's a chance for people in the dynamic language community to work together on JVM implementations.

 * Tom Churchill and Vinny Fiano will demo Churchill Navigation's earth-rendering engine (which looks like Google Earth, only apparently even better and faster ;) ). Vinny (their main Python guy) will explain how they built the glue logic (and why they decided against SWIG) and perhaps some of the implications of using Python as a scripting language in a real-time (60 fps) environment, and the techniques we employed to keep the graphics pipeline from stalling when making an expensive call into their engine from Python.

 * Brian Granger from [http://txcorp.com/ Tech-X] will help us think more deeply about concurrent Python programming, especially as seen in a new version of [http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/IPython1 IPython].

== Sprint: January 6, 2007 ==

 * JythonSprint. We talked about rethinking the existing compiler to converge on !CPython 2.5/trunk.

== Meeting: December 20, 2006 ==

Canceled! We were going to plan the JythonSprint and see some demos. But a blizzard intervened. Fortunately, we should be able to do all of that instead in January.

== Meeting: November 15, 2006 ==

This was a fun meeting! Even if Jill's has increasingly been high decibel. But we really can't complain about the success of our venue.

 * Steve Rogers showed up for his first meeting with us. He credits seeing the [http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/ Pythoneering blog], now that it's included in the [http://www.pythonware.com/daily/index.htm Daily Python-URL]. It's good to have the visibility. With Steve around and fresh from [http://sc06.supercomputing.org/ Supercomputing 2006], we talked a lot about parallel computing paradigms in Python, among other things.

== Meeting: October 18, 2006 ==

 * Discussed possible proposals for PyCon2007. The basic consensus was that it was a great idea that for PyCon "we're especially interested in presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful." In particular, we all would like to see talks with more useful takeaway code, not just talks saying, hey we are doing great things with Python. Trust us :) .

 * Began planning of BoulderSprint, which apparently has been a burning desire for JimBaker for a while.
