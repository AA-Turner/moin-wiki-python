= About Us =
[[http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers|Front Range Pythoneers]] are an active Python users group meeting in Boulder and Denver, Colorado, USA.

= Activities =
We meet every third Wednesday of the month to learn from talks about Python topics, to swap stories and coding tips, and to enjoy food and drink.  But we don't just talk about Python, we live it: on the first Saturday of most months, we get together for a code sprint.  Front Range Pythoneers are proud to have contributed as a group to TurboGears2, Jython, Django, and IPython.

Join us!  Whether you're just learning Python or have already memorized the output of "import this", you'll find something worthwhile.

= The Mailing List and Wiki =
Please join our [[http://lists.community.tummy.com/mailman/listinfo/frpythoneers|mailing list]] and check [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers|this page]] at the Python Wiki for more information about [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers|Front Range Pythoneers]].

We just happen to have the friendliest bunch of Python people coming to our meetings. So why not come too?

There are some other great groups in the area that we interact with on  a periodic basis. Shared membership helps here!

 * [[http://dim.com/~sms/bsc/|Boulder Software Club]]

 * [[http://www.boulderjug.org/|Boulder Java Users Group]]

 * [[http://www.denverjug.org/|Denver Java Users Group]] Meet the 2nd Wed. of every month at Tivoli in Denver. Let us know if you want another [[http://www.jython.org/Project/|Jython]] talk and who you want to speak.

 * [[http://boulder.pm.org/|Boulder Perl Mongers]]. They don't meet formally often - perhaps 2 or 3 times in the last 6 years? - but doesn't prevent other modes of meeting like hikes and disk golf.

 * [[http://rubyforge.org/projects/bdrg/|Boulder-Denver Ruby Group]]

Please add your favorite group here if it seems relevant to local Pythoneering.
