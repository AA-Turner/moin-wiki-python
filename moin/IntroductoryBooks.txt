The books on this page are all general introductions to the
Python language.  
Most of these books will contain a few chapters on particular
applications such as GUI interfaces or Web programming, but won't go
into great detail on any one topic; refer to the PythonBooks page for lists of 
application-specific books.
Experienced programmers who prefer a brief and condensed introduction
should look at the list of ReferenceBooks.

'''Core Python Programming'''
 Wesley J. Chun

ISBN:0130260363,
Prentice Hall PTR,
816 pages (January 2001)

From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest,
friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and
putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of
other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it
does go into some important Python topics carefully and in
depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or
tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too
many in-depth real-world examples in the book [hopefully he will do a
followup volume], it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax
and structure."

Covers up to Python 2.0.  CD-ROM for Unix, Win32, and MacOS.
