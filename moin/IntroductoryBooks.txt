The books on this page are all general introductions to the
Python language.
Most of these books will contain a few chapters on particular
applications such as GUI interfaces or Web programming, but won't go
into great detail on any one topic; refer to the PythonBooks page for lists of
application-specific books.
Experienced programmers who prefer a brief and condensed introduction

[[http://www.manning.com/sande|Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners]] by Warren Sande and Carter Sande

 * ISBN10: 1933988495
 * Manning Publications
 * 488 pages (January 2009)

"Computer programming is a powerful tool for children to 'learn learning,' that is, to learn the skills of thinking and problem-solving...Children who engage in programming transfer that kind of learning to other things."--Nicholas Negroponte, the man behind the One Laptop Per Child project that hopes to put a computer in the hands of every child on earth, January 2008

Your computer won't respond when you yell at it. Why not learn to talk to your computer in its own language? Whether you want to write games, start a business, or you're just curious, learning to program is a great place to start. Plus, programming is fun!

Hello World! provides a gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer programming. It's written in language a 12-year-old can follow, but anyone who wants to learn how to program a computer can use it. Even adults. Written by Warren Sande and his son, Carter, and reviewed by professional educators, this book is kid-tested and parent-approved. You don't need to know anything about programming to use the book. But you should know the basics of using a computer--e-mail, surfing the web, listening to music, and so forth. If you can start a program and save a file, you should have no trouble using this book. 

Color ebook and black and white print book are both available from the publisher at

[[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language]] by Mark Summerfield

 * ISBN10: 0137129297
 * Addison-Wesley Professional
 * 540 pages (December 2008)

This book teaches you how to write programs using Python 3 in good Python 3 style.

The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, including scientists and engineers, who need to do some programming in support of their work. It will also prove ideal for those Python 2 programmers who need to migrate (or prepare to migrate) to Python 3. The book is also suitable for students—the only prerequisite is some basic knowledge of programming in any language, for example, Basic or Java, or of course Python itself.

The book teaches solid procedural style programming, then builds on that to teach
solid object-oriented programming, and then goes on to more advanced
topics such as descriptors and class decorators. But even newcomers to
Python 3 should be able to write useful (although small and basic)
programs after reading chapter 1, and then go on to create larger and
more sophisticated programs as they work through the chapters.

The book's  [[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|web site]] lists the table of contents and has
links to extracts. It also has all the examples and exercise solutions available for download.

'''Core Python Programming'''
 Wesley J. Chun

ISBN: 0132269937 (2nd ed.); 0130260363 (1st ed.)

Prentice Hall PTR / Pearson Education

~1120 pages (Sep 2006); 810 pages (Jan 2001)

The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don't really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more '''effective''' Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or "quick dives" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference -- it is *not* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the ''Python Essential Reference'' or ''Python in a Nutshell''.

The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material.  As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today.

From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest,
friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of
other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it
does go into some important Python topics carefully and in
depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or
tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too
many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a
followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax
and structure."

'''How Would Pareto Learn(tm) Python!'''

[[http://www.testingperspective.com|Rahul Verma]]

"How Would Pareto Learn(TM)" is an effort to apply Pareto's principle to learning efforts - "Concentrate FIRST on those 20% things which are essential 80% of the times and then learn further". The target outcome is light-weight tutorials, which make one quickly get into programming mode, rather than sticking to excessive theoretical stuff. When one starts writing programs, the practical problems make learning more interesting. After reaching this mode, there are plenty of books and tutorials where you can find specific details. "How Would Pareto Learn(TM)"-series bridges the gap between very basic tutorials and comprehensive books.

How Would Pareto Learn(tm) Python! is the first in this series and has got encouraging feedback so far. One can read the book online in its present state at the following link:
