'''Video Overview:'''

Learn to use Python for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

Assume your target is running unpatched Windows XP, Anti-Virus is disabled, the firewall is turned off, IPS is not in place then you may (or not) get into a system! Does that sound like a real-world penetration test for you?

If you have ever attended an ethical hacking course that teaches you how to use some tools and how to click on some buttons, then you probably already know that being an advanced hacker needs more knowledge than clicking a few buttons as most of these tools will fail in a real-world scenario.

Whether you get bored from theory and basic courses which repeat the same tools and techniques over and over again and fail to teach you how to hack into even insecure systems, or you want to push your skills from beginner to the next level, then you have come to the right place!

There are quite a lot of people who call themselves hackers but, few have the solid skills to fit the definition, when other's tools fail, writing your own makes you a true hacker.

Data analysts, Machine Learning professionals, and data scientists often use tools such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NumPy for data analysis on their personal computer. However, when they want to apply their analyses to larger datasets, these tools fail to scale beyond a single machine, and so the analyst is forced to rewrite their computation.

In this course, you’ll learn to scale your data analysis. Firstly, you will execute distributed data science projects right from data ingestion to data manipulation and visualization using Dask. Then, you will explore the Dask framework. After, see how Dask can be used with other common Python tools such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more.

246 pages, 2015

Getting started with programming can be an intimidating challenge. Most books and tutorials assume lots of previous knowledge, skip over jargon and new concepts, and use examples that only make sense if you already understand programming.

This book is different. It gives you an introduction to programming in Python from the ground up, starting with tips on installation and setting up your programming environment, and moving through the core parts of the Python language in a logical order. Dr. Jones has drawn on his many years experience teaching programming to produce a book that will guide you through the language step by step in simple terms.

The book doesn't assume any previous knowledge, and introduces fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops and functions using simple terms and easy-to-follow examples that you can run and modify.

The book takes a unique approach to practical exercises. Rather than simply presenting you with the solutions, it shows you how large, complex programs are gradually built up from simple building blocks, explaining the role of every line. You can download the examples and exercise solutions - edit, modify and run them yourself.

Geospatial data is hard to ignore. Nearly every car, phone, or camera has a GPS sensor, and aerial photos, satellite imagery, and data representing political boundaries, roads, rivers, and streams are available for free download from many websites. Geoprocessing is the science of reading, analyzing, and presenting geospatial data programmatically. The Python language, along with dozens of open source libraries and tools, makes it possible to take on professional geoprocessing tasks without investing in expensive proprietary packages like ArcGIS and MapInfo.

Geoprocessing with Python teaches you how to use the Python programming language along with free and open source tools to read, write, and process geospatial data. You'll learn how to access available data sets to make maps or perform your own analyses using free and open source tools like the GDAL, Shapely, and Fiona Python modules. You'll master core practices like handling multiple vector file formats, editing and manipulating geometries, applying spatial and attribute filters, working with projections, and performing basic analyses on vector data. You'll also learn how to create geospatial data, rather than just consuming it. The book also covers how to manipulate and analyze raster data, such as aerial photographs, satellite images, and digital elevation models.

The Computer Science Department of Michigan State University converted their Introduction to Programming Course [[http:www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231|CSE 231]] to Python in the Fall of 2007. One of the products of this change was this textbook, written as a general introduction to CS1 using Python. The book adopts the theme of "data manipulation" for its examples, focusing on using real-world datasets and manipulating them (averages, graphs, indicies, searches, etc.) in various ways.

The book covers the standard CS1 curriculum, and includes extensive algorithm development sections to help students in their study of computing. Supplemental material is also provided including: full set of power point slides, collaborative lab exercises, project homeworks and solutions to over 600 exercises in the book.

A Learner's Guide to Programming, using the Python Language

 * ISBN-10: 0596802374
 * ISBN-13: 978-0596802370
 * O'Reilly Media
 * 440 pages (November 2009)

Ever wished you could learn how to program from a book? If you have no previous programming experience, you might be wondering where to start. Head First Programming introduces the core concepts of writing computer programs--variables, decisions, loops, functions, and objects--which apply regardless of the programming language, but uses concrete examples and exercises in the dynamic and versatile Python language to apply and reinforce these concepts.

Learn the basic tools to start writing the programs that interests you, not the generic software someone else thinks you should have, and get a better understanding of what software can (and cannot) do. When you're finished, you'll have the necessary foundation to apply to whatever language or software project you need or want to learn.

[[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language (Second Edition)]] by Mark Summerfield

 * ISBN10: 0321680561
 * Addison-Wesley Professional
 * 648 pages (November 2009)

This book teaches you how to write programs using Python 3 in good Python 3 style.

The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, including scientists and engineers, who need to do some programming in support of their work. It will also prove ideal for those Python 2 programmers who need to migrate (or prepare to migrate) to Python 3. The book is also suitable for students—the only prerequisite is some basic knowledge of programming in any language, for example, Basic or Java, or of course Python itself.

The book teaches solid procedural style programming, then builds on that to teach solid object-oriented programming, and then goes on to more advanced topics such as descriptors and class decorators. But even newcomers to Python 3 should be able to write useful (although small and basic) programs after reading chapter 1, and then go on to create larger and more sophisticated programs as they work through the chapters.

The book's [[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|web site]] lists the table of contents and has links to extracts. It also has all the examples and exercise solutions available for download.

 * Cambridge University Press
 * 272 pages (March 2009)

Python for Software Design is a concise introduction to software design using the Python programming language. Intended for people with no programming experience, this book starts with the most basic concepts and gradually adds new material. Some of the ideas students find most challenging, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters. The focus is on the programming process, with special emphasis on debugging. The book includes a wide range of exercises, from short examples to substantial projects, so that students have ample opportunity to practice each new concept. Exercise solutions and code examples are available from thinkpython.com, along with Swampy, a suite of Python programs that is used in some of the exercises.

"Computer programming is a powerful tool for children to 'learn learning,' that is, to learn the skills of thinking and problem-solving...Children who engage in programming transfer that kind of learning to other things."--Nicholas Negroponte, the man behind the One Laptop Per Child project that hopes to put a computer in the hands of every child on earth, January 2008

Your computer won't respond when you yell at it. Why not learn to talk to your computer in its own language? Whether you want to write games, start a business, or you're just curious, learning to program is a great place to start. Plus, programming is fun!

Hello World! provides a gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer programming. It's written in language a 12-year-old can follow, but anyone who wants to learn how to program a computer can use it. Even adults. Written by Warren Sande and his son, Carter, and reviewed by professional educators, this book is kid-tested and parent-approved. You don't need to know anything about programming to use the book. But you should know the basics of using a computer--e-mail, surfing the web, listening to music, and so forth. If you can start a program and save a file, you should have no trouble using this book.

'''Core Python Programming'''

 . Wesley J. Chun

ISBN: 0132269937 (2nd ed.); 0130260363 (1st ed.)

Prentice Hall PTR / Pearson Education

~1120 pages (Sep 2006); 810 pages (Jan 2001)

The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don't really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more '''effective''' Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or "quick dives" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference -- it is *not* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the ''Python Essential Reference'' or ''Python in a Nutshell''.

The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material. As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today.

From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure."

'''Practical Programming (in Python)''' [[https://launchpad.net/practical-programming|"Practical Programming (in Python)"]] is meant as a first programming course and is tightly aligned with the [[http://www.otago.ac.nz|University of Otago]] introductory programming course called [[http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/student/papers.php?name=COMP150|Practical Programming]]. The textbook is organized into 24 "lectures" that cover all the basics of programming (sequence, selection, iteration, functions etc), plus all the major data structures supplied by Python.

This textbook is a modified version of [[http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/|"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition"]], by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers.
