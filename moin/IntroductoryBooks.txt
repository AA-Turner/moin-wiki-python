[[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language (Second Edition)]] by Mark Summerfield


 * ISBN10: 0321680561
 * Addison-Wesley Professional
 * 648 pages (November 2009)


This book teaches you how to write programs using Python 3 in good Python 3 style.


The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, including scientists and engineers, who need to do some programming in support of their work. It will also prove ideal for those Python 2 programmers who need to migrate (or prepare to migrate) to Python 3. The book is also suitable for studentsâ€”the only prerequisite is some basic knowledge of programming in any language, for example, Basic or Java, or of course Python itself.


The book teaches solid procedural style programming, then builds on that to teach solid object-oriented programming, and then goes on to more advanced topics such as descriptors and class decorators. But even newcomers to Python 3 should be able to write useful (although small and basic) programs after reading chapter 1, and then go on to create larger and more sophisticated programs as they work through the chapters.


The book's [[http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html|web site]] lists the table of contents and has links to extracts. It also has all the examples and exercise solutions available for download.

"Computer programming is a powerful tool for children to 'learn learning,' that is, to learn the skills of thinking and problem-solving...Children who engage in programming transfer that kind of learning to other things."--Nicholas Negroponte, the man behind the One Laptop Per Child project that hopes to put a computer in the hands of every child on earth, January 2008


Your computer won't respond when you yell at it. Why not learn to talk to your computer in its own language? Whether you want to write games, start a business, or you're just curious, learning to program is a great place to start. Plus, programming is fun!


Hello World! provides a gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer programming. It's written in language a 12-year-old can follow, but anyone who wants to learn how to program a computer can use it. Even adults. Written by Warren Sande and his son, Carter, and reviewed by professional educators, this book is kid-tested and parent-approved. You don't need to know anything about programming to use the book. But you should know the basics of using a computer--e-mail, surfing the web, listening to music, and so forth. If you can start a program and save a file, you should have no trouble using this book.

'''Core Python Programming'''


 . Wesley J. Chun


ISBN: 0132269937 (2nd ed.); 0130260363 (1st ed.)


Prentice Hall PTR / Pearson Education


~1120 pages (Sep 2006); 810 pages (Jan 2001)


The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don't really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more '''effective''' Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or "quick dives" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference -- it is *not* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the ''Python Essential Reference'' or ''Python in a Nutshell''.


The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material. As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today.


From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure."
