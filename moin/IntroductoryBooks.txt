The books on this page are all general introductions to the
Python language.
Most of these books will contain a few chapters on particular
applications such as GUI interfaces or Web programming, but won't go
into great detail on any one topic; refer to the PythonBooks page for lists of
application-specific books.
Experienced programmers who prefer a brief and condensed introduction
should look at the list of ReferenceBooks.
