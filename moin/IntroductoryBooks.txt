The books on this page are all general introductions to the
Python language.
Most of these books will contain a few chapters on particular
applications such as GUI interfaces or Web programming, but won't go
into great detail on any one topic; refer to the PythonBooks page for lists of
application-specific books.
Experienced programmers who prefer a brief and condensed introduction
should look at the list of ReferenceBooks.

'''Core Python Programming'''
 Wesley J. Chun

ISBN: 0132269937 (2nd ed.); 0130260363 (1st ed.)

Prentice Hall PTR / Pearson Education

~1120 pages (Sep 2006); 810 pages (Jan 2001)

The main goal of this book is comprehensively teaching you the core of the Python language, much more than just its syntax (which you don't really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more '''effective''' Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or "quick dives" into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (in-depth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% reference -- it is *not* meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the ''Python Essential Reference'' or ''Python in a Nutshell''.

The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material.  As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and up-to-date Python book on the market today.

From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest,
friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of
other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it
does go into some important Python topics carefully and in
depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or
tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too
many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a
followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax
and structure."
