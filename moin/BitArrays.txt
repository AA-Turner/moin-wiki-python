Bit arrays, bitstrings, bit vectors, bit fields.

Whatever they are called, these useful objects are often the most compact way to store data. If you can depict your data as boolean values, and can correlate each value with a unique integer, a bit array is a natural choice.

Sets of positive integers are straightforward. The set containing 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 (the prime numbers less than 32) can be represented in 4 bytes by:

{{{#!Python
# bit 31                          bit 0
#      |                              |
#      10100000100010100010100010101100  =  0xA08A28AC
}}}

The entire set of signed bytes can be represented in 256 bits, where '''bit n''' corresponds to the number '''n - 128'''. The set of all integers can be mapped to the positive integers:

{{{#!Python
for n in range(17):
    if (n & 1):                   # if n is odd, n
        i = -((n + 1) >> 1)       # represents a negative number
    else:
        i = (n >> 1)
    print(i, end = ' ')

# result: 0 -1 1 -2 2 -3 3 -4 4 -5 5 -6 6 -7 7 -8 8
}}}

Increasingly sophisticated modules are available for generating and using bit arrays (see bit* in the Python package index) but it isn't hard to set up and use a simple bit array. The following demonstration calculates the number of 32-bit integers needed for all the data bits requested and builds an array initialized to all 0's or all 1's. The program reports the number of "excess" bits if the number requested was not an exact multiple of 32.

{{{#!Python
# A bit array demo - written for Python 3.0
import array
def makeBitArray(bitSize, fill = 0):
    intSize = bitSize >> 5                   # number of 32 bit integers
    if (bitSize & 31):                      # if bitSize != (32 * n) add
        intSize += 1                        #    a record for stragglers
    if fill == 1:
        fill = 4294967295                                 # all bits set
    else:
        fill = 0                                      # all bits cleared
    bitArray = array.array('I')       # 'I' = unsigned integer = 32 bits
    count = 0
    while (intSize):
        if(intSize & 1):                           # for each power of 2
            tempArray = array.array('I')           # in intSize, add
            tempArray.append(fill)                 # that many integers
            for index in range(count):             # to the array
                tempArray.extend(tempArray)
            bitArray.extend(tempArray)
        count += 1
        intSize >>= 1
    return(bitArray)

# testBit() returns a nonzero result, 2**offset, if the bit at 'offset' is one.
def testBit(int_type, offset):
    mask = 1 << offset
    return(int_type & mask)

# setBit() returns an integer with the bit at 'offset' set to 1.
def setBit(int_type, offset):
    mask = 1 << offset
    return(int_type | mask)

# clearBit() returns an integer with the bit at 'offset' cleared.
def clearBit(int_type, offset):
    mask = ~(1 << offset)
    return(int_type & mask)

# toggleBit() returns an integer with the bit at 'offset' inverted, 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0.
def toggleBit(int_type, offset):
    mask = 1 << offset
    return(int_type ^ mask)

bits = 65536                     # change these numbers to 

ini = 1                          # test the function

myArray = makeBitArray(bits, ini)

# array info: input bits; final length; excess bits; fill pattern

}}}

For a more "real world" example, the following code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes (for an explanation, see Wikipedia) to find all of the primes less than 65536 (2 to the 16th power) and leaves them in a bit array. This is not the place to go into all the details of how the Sieve works, so it is left in an informal form. To run the Sieve, change the main body of the program (everything after the fuction definitions) to:

{{{#!Python
# Python 3.0

bits = 65536                             # upper limit on primes

ini = 1

myArray = makeBitArray(bits, ini)

# 0 and 1 are not prime, and not included in the Sieve of Eratosthenes:
bit = 0
myArray[0] = clearBit(myArray[0], bit)
bit = 1
myArray[0] = clearBit(myArray[0], bit)

for index in range(256):            # range is to *square root* of limit
    record = index >> 5
    bit = index & 31
    test = testBit(myArray[record], bit)
    if test:
        zeroBit = index * index
        while zeroBit < 65536:
            record = zeroBit >> 5
            bit = zeroBit & 31
            myArray[record] = clearBit(myArray[record], bit)
            zeroBit += index

for index in range(65536):
    record = index >> 5
    bit = index & 31
    test = testBit(myArray[record], bit)
    if test:
        print(index)
}}}

You might want to redirect output to a file, especially if you increase the limits.

The above demo does not use either setBit() or toggleBit(), and storage of lists of integers only scratches the surface of what can be done with bits as data. There is a huge amount of work out there, dating back to the days when computers had memories and storage measured in bytes, on this topic.
