= Python for Systems Administration =

Python is used in numerous places for systems management and administration:

 * Many GNU/Linux distributions use Python to manage resources and packages:
   * In many programs and components in the Ubuntu distributions (and related services): "Ubuntu prefer the community to contribute work in Python." ([[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/developerzone/bounties|Ubuntu bounties for Python work]])
   * [[http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1|Reconstructor]] for Ubuntu and [[http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/|Revisor]] for Fedora - applications which let users customise their GNU/Linux distribution CDs - are both written in Python
   * Red Hat's up2date tool (the pulsating red dot)
   * [[http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/|yum]] provides software updates for Fedora and other distributions
   * [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock|mock]] and [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Plague|plague]] controls the building of the packages in the Fedora operating system
   * Fedora and Red Hat's installer, [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda|Anaconda]] (notice the clever python tie-in on the name).  
   * Gentoo Linux ''relies'' on Python since the [[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/|Portage]] package management system is written in Python
   * Pardus uses Python extensively: [[http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/comar/PythonInPardus.html|"Python in Pardus"]]
 * HP Compaq / IBM preinstalled Python on a series of computers for some administration tasks
