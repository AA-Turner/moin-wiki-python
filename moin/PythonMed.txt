= PythonMed =
This page attempts to collect all the Python packages associated with medicine, pre-clinical research, life science and bioinformatics for the community. Its modelled along the [[http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed|Debian Med project]]

== Biopython ==
Biopython facilitates the use of Python for bioinformatics through high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats (BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,...), access to online services (NCBI, Expasy,...), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs (Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS...), a standard sequence class, various clustering modules, a KD tree data structure, etc.
