I started porting Django to Python 3 at PyCon2008. The current patch allows me to get through the tutorial, but there are certainly large parts of the code base that I haven't touched, so more issues are likely to show up.

The current version of the patch is available from http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/home/loewis/django.diff

'''Which version (release or SVN revision) of Django is your patch based on?'''

= Porting Strategy =

This port attempts to maintain compatibility with older Python versions from a single code base;
the goal is to support all versions that Django supports, plus 3.0. The current patch fails
to do so in certain details, due to bugs in the 2to3 tool.

To simplify porting, and to allow running Django from a single code base, I changed distutils
to allow invocation of the 2to3 tool as part of the build_py step, if setup.py is invoked
from python3.0. To add that support, I first made 2to3 a standard library (named lib2to3).

This approach mostly works, and has the following flaws:

 * some of the fixers work incorrectly (bugs 2453, 2446, 2468)

 * even though it runs with the -w option, it still prints out all diffs to stdout.
 This might be desired in some cases, but should perhaps be restricted to the verbose
 mode of distutils

 * conversion is rather slow (takes 17min on my machine) (#2431)

 * conversion leaves a number of .bak files in the build/ directory; these are redundant
 as the build directory is temporary, anyway (the original files are not touched by 2to3
 here).

= Changes =

The changes can be roughly grouped into the following categories

== Naming Changes ==

A number of modules that django uses have been removed, or renamed:
 * md5 is no longer; instead of md5.md5 or md5.init, use hashlib.md5. 
 For this change, a fixer could be written (#2454).

 * all modules in the email package got renamed to lower-case. 
 I haven't actually tested whether any of the email functionality 
 in Django still works (I don't even know what that functionality could be).

 * cStringIO is no longer; Django should use io.BytesIO instead.

In addition, a few functions and attributes got renamed:

 * to test whether something is a function, don't look at 
 `func_code` anymore; use `__code__` instead.

== Bytes vs. Strings ==

Python 3 separates byte strings and character strings clearly, and defines
that string literals are character strings, unless prefixed as bytes.
Character strings are always represented as sequence of Unicode characters.

2to3 will change all occurrences of the unicode identifier to str, but leave
all occurrences of str alone. It will also change all Unicode string literals
to regular string literals, but leave the existing string literals alone.

As a consequence, it produces code like this one:
{{{
  class EscapeString(str, EscapeData): pass
  class EscapeUnicode(str, EscapeDate): pass
}}}

These types were meant to be separate, but became identical after 2to3.

To fix these problems, I made the following changes:
 * introduce django.utils.py3.bytes, which is the bytes type in 3.x, but an 
 alias for str in 2.x. Use that in all places where str is used as a type.

 * introduce django.utils.py3.b, which is a function that converts its argument 
 to an ASCII-encoded byte string. In 2.x, it is another alias for str; 
 in 3.x, it leaves byte strings alone, and encodes regular (unicode) strings 
 as ASCII. This function is used in all places where string literals are 
 meant as bytes, plus all cases where str() was used to invoke the default 
 conversion of 2.x.

 * Django encourages users to define `__unicode__` methods in models; 2to3
 leaves them alone. Rather than changing them to str, I kept the Django
 approach of calling them explicitly. In some cases, they were called
 implicitly (through unicode()); these calls had to be converted.

 * md5.hexdigest returns a (unicode) string in 3.x; Django assumes the
 digest is a byte sequence.

 * When Django reads a file, it typically uses the pattern
   {{{ open(name).read().decode(encoding)... }}}
 This breaks, as .read() now returns a (unicode) string, which is already
 decoded. This can be fixed by adding {{{'rb'}}} as a parameter to open().

 * Django builds keyword dictionaries to be passed as ** arguments into
 functions, and puts str() objects into them. As now all str() objects
 consistently become byte strings, calling the function fails. 3.x will
 require Unicode strings here. However, using Unicode strings would break
 on 2.x, so this gets special-cased based on sys.version_info.

 * urllib.quote currently doesn't work on bytes; I think it should. 
 To work around, I convert the argument into a Unicode string.

== New-style classes ==

  * Django uses types.ClassType to create new classes at run-time. Change that
  to use type in 3.x, through a test for sys.version_info.
  * Django defines a __metaclass__ ModelBase, and uses it in Model. As the
  syntax for metaclass declarations has changed, I needed to change the code;
  this should be done by 2to3, though (#2366)
  * Django relies on clearing the dictionary of the class called Meta in a
  Model. This a) doesn't work anymore, as the dictionary proxy is immutable,
  and b) leaves over a number of attributes in the class that are new in 3.x
  (`__weakref__` and `__dict__`). I copy the dict, then clear it. I don't understand
  why it is important to clear the dict, other than checking that all attributes
  have been processed completely, so I hope this change is correct.

== Other changes ==

 * the hex codec does not exist anymore, use binhex.unhexlify
 * list.sort doesn't support the sort function anymore. In the specific case,
 rewriting it to use a key= function was straight-forward.
 * Django sorts Fields by creation_counter, to get the declaration order. It
 uses `__cmp__` as a relationship. I added `__lt__`, and it seems to work, but
 I think a fixer should be added to 2to3, or the entire `__cmp__` story be
 thought over again.
 * In AdminLogNode, limit shows up as a string, not as an int, and slice() will complain. 
 I'm not sure why that works in 2.x.

= Open Issues =

 * I have worked with sqlite3 only; all the other databases have not been tested.
 * The manage module has an "import settings", this gets fixed to "from . import settings"
 by 2to3. When manage.py is then run as the main script, Python complains that the relative
 import is incorrect. However, that *would* be correct if the script is imported as
 <site>.manage
 * checks for `im_func` need to be replaced with checks for `__func__`.
 * ... (many more things; this just barely works)
