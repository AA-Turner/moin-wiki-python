Some experiences with Jira:

 * SF conversions seems to work fine.

 * needs login for every user, even for read.
    * This is just a configuration issue. [http://issues.apache.org/jira/ The Apache JIRA] has public read enabled.

 * can do convenient mass edits, for example, I could assign all issues currently assigned to "loewis" to "mloewis".

Bignose:

 According to the [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing.jsp licensing and pricing] page for Jira, it is non-free software. We can't examine, improve, or commission others to do these things to it. Why are we considering a non-free tracker for Python?
