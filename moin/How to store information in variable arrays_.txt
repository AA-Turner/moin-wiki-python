How would I store information in variables that I can go back later and compare? Such as 

x = 1

while x != 10:
     text[x] = int(raw_input("Enter a number: "))
     x = x + 1

for x in range (10): 
    print text[x]

I just need to do this to compare a history to make sure a number hasn't already been entered earlier. But this is just a small example. I get nasty errors. 

Thanks!
