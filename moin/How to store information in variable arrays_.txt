How would I store information in variables that I can go back later and compare? Such as 

x = 1
text = []
while x <= 10:
     text.append(int(raw_input("Enter a number: ")))
     x = x + 1

for x in range(10): 
    print text[x]

I just need to do this to compare a history to make sure a number hasn't already been entered earlier. But this is just a small example. I get nasty errors. 

Thanks!

edit: that should work now
We initialize a list first with text = [].
Then we just append each element to that list.
