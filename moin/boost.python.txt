The Boost Python Library allows the use of C/C++ from Python. It is part of the larger boost package (http://www.boost.org).

Use the Boost Python Library to quickly and easily export a C++ library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++ classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python. The system should simply ''reflect'' your C++ classes and functions into Python. 

A summary of the development goals is available on the Python [http://www.python.org/sigs/c++-sig/ C++-sig] page, which also serves as a mailing list for users of both versions of the library. A preview of the v2 documentation is available [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/boost/boost/libs/python/doc/v2/index.html?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/html here], and instructions for getting started with a prerelease are available upon request.

While v2 is being developed, this page seems like a good place to assemble v2 intro and tutorial.
