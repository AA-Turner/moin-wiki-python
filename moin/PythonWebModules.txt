   These modules used to be known as the lemon modules. The CVS is still hosted at http://lemon.sourceforge.net/

"It is better to have a flexible module that can be used intuitively than 
an all-singing, all-dancing framework that no-one can be bothered to learn."

The Python Web Modules are a suite of simple and easy to use Python components
desinged to allow developers to write Python CGI scripts or web applications
with SQL databases, sessions, templates, email and authorisation functionality
without having to install Web Application Servers. 

A key part of the project is the creation of documentation and examples to allow
developers with less time or expierince to understand the concepts of Python web
programming without having to read all the sources and comments from the very
beginning. 

The modules can easily be used on shared web hosting accounts running Apache and
Python for example.

=== Deployment Platforms ===

The Web Modules were written because although there are quite a few web application frameworks available they are either too simplistic, or require adminster rights to install and so cannot be used with most shared hosting accounts.

The modules provide everything needed to write data-driven websites without needing installation or superuser rights. Included are database drivers and even a webserver so they should run on any computer or server which runs Python 2.2 or above. Currently the only pure-Python database supported is Gadfly and this has some limitations so ideally users should use MySQL or SQLite instead.

Developers can use the modules with other servers such as Zope or on their own but the author tends to use them in CGI scripts on Apache running on FreeBSD or Linux servers.

Future releases will also conform to the WSGI being discussed on the WEB-SIG mailing list at the moment.

=== Database Support ===

A major part of the project are the database modules. The modules include support for the following:
