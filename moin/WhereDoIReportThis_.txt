= Where Do I Report ...? =

If you've been affected by a problem with some of the python.org sites and want to report it, these are the contact addresses or issue trackers you should use:

== A bug with Python itself ==

Raise an issue on the [https://bugs.python.org/|Python Issue Tracker]

NB the Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for help with debugging your code. Only post there if you have good reason to believe that your code is correct but that Python itself is faulty. Check the [https://docs.python.org/3/faq/|Python FAQ] first in case your issue is covered there.
