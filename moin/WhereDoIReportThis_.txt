= Where Do I Report ...? =

If you want to report a problem, these are the contact addresses or issue trackers you should use:

== A bug with Python itself ==

Raise an issue on the [[https://bugs.python.org/|Python Issue Tracker]]

NB the Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for help with debugging your code. Only post there if you have good reason to believe that your code is correct but that Python itself is faulty. Check the [[https://docs.python.org/3/faq/|Python FAQ]] first in case your issue is covered there.

== A Python Trademark Question ==

If you wish to use Python as a trademark or have a question about someone who has, the [[https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/|PSF Trademark Usage page]] has the details.

You can contact the [[mailto:psf-trademarks@python.org|PSF Committtee]] about specific issues not addressed by that page.

== An issue with PyPI ==

If you notice a bug with PyPI raise it on [[https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/|their issue tracker]].

== A problem with the python.org Website ==

Problems with the website itself should be raised on [[https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/|their issue tracker]].
