Hi,

I signed up to correct some links on the [[buildout/pycon2008 tutorial|pycon2008 tutorial]].

I'm at the moment (2013) employed at [[http://www.dbc.dk|DBC A/S]] where I work as a developer. Coding mostly Drupal (PHP) but I am looking into using Python for creating and managing jobs at a Jenkins server to make building and testing easier. Hopefully I will continue to use Python for various purposes such as hacking, testing and pure fun. ;-)


/Michael
