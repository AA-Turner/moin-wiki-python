VPython is an extension for Python to allow easy, "pythonic" 3D.  It is used in education for various purposes, including teaching physics and programming, but it has also been used by research scientists to visualize systems or data in 3D.

[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rwchabay/mi/ Matter & Interactions] An introductory calculus-based physics curriculum for engineering and science students by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood (NCSU) that emphasizes a small number of powerful fundamental principles, incorporates the atomic nature of matter throughout, and includes an introduction to computational physics, in which students write programs in VPython to predict motion and to visualize fields. At this URL you'll find a bunch of VPython lecture demo programs useful in teaching introductory physics.
