Python user since 1997, starting as a replacement for C++ for cgi-scripts.

Currently using Python for work mostly as the glue to make CVS an acceptable Version Control System ( which was the topic of my talk at Pycon 2006 [http://www.xs4all.nl/~anthon/pycon2006/] ). 

Python is also the implementation and configuration language for the Sanbox build system I developed. That system overcomes the problems associated with the lack of revisioned metadata in CVS and has several advantages over they way (non-portable) revisioned metadata is stored in other VCSs. The Sandbox system also makes it possible to gradually change large codebases from one VCS to another (Bazaar-NG being my favourite target).
