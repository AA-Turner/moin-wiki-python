SSL stands for '''Secure Sockets Layer''' and is designed to create secure connection between client and server. Secure means that connection is encrypted and therefore protected from eavesdropping. It also allows to validate server identity.

=== SSL libraries availability and limitations ===
 * Python 2.5 (the version AppEngine is running)
