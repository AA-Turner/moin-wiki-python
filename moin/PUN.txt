Welcome to the homepage of the Python Users Nederland. We are the dutch user group for Python. Periodical meet-ups are organized and announced on the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-nl mailinglist].

= Dutch =

Most Python Users Netherlands speak dutch. Non-dutch speaking people are also welcome. We assume that they are willing to adapt, brave enough to ask ''alsjeblieft langzamer praten'' and smart enough to find on-line tools that do translations.
