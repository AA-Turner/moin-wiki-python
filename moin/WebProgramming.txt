This topic guide is a word by word copy of Paul Boddie's 
[http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/web_frameworks.html Python Web Frameworks Overview]. Putting it into Wiki format hopefully allows more people to contribute. 

The main purpose of this topic guide is to help in choosing a framework for web programming without having to learn each of them. In addition, information about different PresentationTechnologies is also provided, where appropriate, since this can be a major deciding factor in choosing a framework.

Although comments and clarifications by the framework authors are very much appreciated, adding a standard signature like InTheirOwnWords would help to bring words like 'easy' and 'intuitive' into context.

The rather strict format of the main entries should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

Known frameworks:
    * ["Zope"]
    * WebWare
    * SkunkWeb
    * TwistedMatrix
    * ["Quixote"]
    * ["Albatross"]
    * JonsPythonModules
    * ["Spyce"]
    * CherryPy
    * ["maki"]
    * ClearSilver
    * ScriptFoundryModules
    * ["Slither"]
    * add new entries by using the code in the WebProgrammingTemplate

Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?
