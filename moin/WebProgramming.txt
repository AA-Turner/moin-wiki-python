'''or, more aptly put, Web ''Server'' Programming''' 

See also: 
 * WebClientProgramming
 * DatabaseProgramming (guidance on available DatabaseInterfaces and related tools)
 * ["PythonAndJ2EE"] (comparison of various frameworks to J2EE)

The main purpose of this topic guide is to help in choosing between the plethora of frameworks and templating systems for Web programming, without having to learn each of them. In addition, information about different PresentationTechnologies is also provided, where appropriate, since this can be a major deciding factor in choosing a framework.

==== Notes on Editing ====

Opinions based on experience are welcome, but framework or templating system authors should sign their comments with InTheirOwnWords to admit to a certain bias.

The rather strict format of the main entries (described in WebProgrammingTemplateHelp) should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

When adding new entries choose Web``Programming``Template when creating the page.

==== Other Guides ====

The listing is '''up-to-date as of 2003-02-11'''

The Web Framework Shootout (at http://colorstudy.com/docs/shootout.html) also covers several of these frameworks.

==== To Do ====
    * The templating systems should really get a different page layout, showing examples etc.
    * describe PHP and Java in the same format as quite a few will want to compare to them anyway
    * Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?

Editor: DanielDittmar (this means only that I will adapt the entries to changes in the WebProgrammingTemplate and that I will try to keep the version entries current)

The libraries in this section implement simpler markup languages
that can be automatically converted to HTML.  This lets you avoid having to write HTML 
by hand.
