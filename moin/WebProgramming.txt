= Web Programming in Python =

This topic guide attempts to cover every aspect of programming Web applications (both clients and servers) using Python.

 * WebStandardisation - working towards common solutions and APIs
 * WebFrameworks - for developing server-side Web applications in Python
 * WebServers - server solutions written in (or using) Python
 * WebServices - tools for accessing and providing functionality via APIs over the Web
 * ["Templating"] - generating output, messages and more from Web applications
 * WebClientProgramming
 * CgiScripts - information on writing CGIs in python when the WebFrameworks seem too heavy or aren't available
 * ContentManagementSystems - solutions specially designed for organising and publishing content (perhaps acting as frameworks to permit application development and customisation)

 * DatabaseProgramming - guidance on available DatabaseInterfaces and related tools

== Editorial Note ==

This simplified start page replaces the previous "comprehensive" guide to Web programming. Unless adding a distinct category of Web programming, please add things like new frameworks to the appropriate page - not to this page.
