= Web Programming in Python =

This topic guide links to the frameworks and templating systems available for Web programming in Python. When deciding to develop Web applications or services, you would usually choose a solution from the list below and then possibly hook it up with a templating system and other components such as database access toolkits, if the solution doesn't provide them - some such as Zope provide virtually everything you can think of!

[[Anchor(TemplatingEngines)]]
== Templating Engines ==

There are many, many different HTML/XML templating libraries for Python that provide different feature sets and syntaxes.  These libraries usually assume that you know how to write HTML or XML.

The number of libraries is so great because such libraries are pretty easy to write in Python; [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52305 this recipe from the Python Cookbook] shows how easy it is.

    * [http://airspeed.pythonconsulting.com/ Airspeed] - Velocity Templates for Python
    * ["Castalian"]
    * ["Cheetah"]
    * CubicTemp
    * [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/ Django template system]
    * [[Anchor(Elements)]][http://www.nthwave.net/elements/ Elements]
    * EmPy
    * [http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/htmltemplate.html HTMLTemplate]
    * [http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/ htmltmpl]
    * [http://wsgiarea.pocoo.org/jinja/ Jinja]

    * [http://www.myghty.org/ Myghty] inspired by Perl's Mason
    * ["pso"]
    * [http://www.entrian.com/PyMeld PyMeld]
    * [[Anchor(SimpleTAL)]][http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/ SimpleTAL]
    * ["Spyce"]
    * [http://www.pytan.com/spytee.html Spytee]
    * [http://www.stringtemplate.org stringtemplate]
    * ["teng"]
    * [http://www.execulink.com/~robin1/wasp/readme.html WASP]
    * [http://www.livinglogic.de/Python/xist/ XIST]

=== HTML Shorthand Processors ===

The libraries in this section implement simpler markup languages
that can be automatically converted to HTML.  This lets you avoid having to write HTML
by hand.

    * [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ AsciiDoc]
    * PyTextile
    * ReStructuredText
    * [http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/ txt2tags]

=== HTML Generation class libraries ===

   * [http://starship.python.net/crew/friedrich/HTMLgen/html/main.html HTMLgen]
   * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/366000 HTMLTags ]
   * [http://dustman.net/andy/python/HyperText/ HyperText]
   * [http://markup.sourceforge.net/ markup ]  A light-weight and flexible HTML/XML generator
   * [http://www.livinglogic.de/Python/xist/ XIST ]
   * [http://pyhtmloo.sourceforge.net/ pyhtmloo ] pyhtmloo is a library that allows python developers to use HTML code like any other python objects.

=== Static Website Generators ===

Static website generators are more then [#TemplatingEngines] in that they create ''the whole site structuire'', not just individual files. While templating is an important part of their function, determining the site structure and ''incorporating structural information'' in the output (for ex. to automatically generate navigational elements) is what really makes a static website generator a useful tool.

   * [http://www.ivy.fr/tahchee/ tahchee] - ["Cheetah"]-based static web site generator
   * [http://www.owlfish.com/software/PubTal/ PubTal] - [#SimpleTAL]-based static web site generator
   * [#Elements]
   * [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/] - Generates Websites from ReST contents

=== Jython-accessible Java Templating Engines ===

   * [http://freemarker.org/index.html FreeMarker] (with Jython data binding)
   * [http://java.sun.com/products/jsp Java Server Pages, JSP]
   * [http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html Velocity]
   * [http://www.webmacro.org/ WebMacro]

=== CPython-accessible C Templating Engines ===

    * ClearSilver (HTML generation)

== Utility modules ==

    * [http://www.chrisarndt.de/en/software/python/#auth Auth modules] - a module collection for authentication purposes
    * [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#dataenc Dataenc] - allows secure and time limited logins to be encoded into webpages for use with web applications
    * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/305288 HTTP basic authentication example]

==== Notes on Editing ====

Opinions based on experience are welcome, but framework or templating system authors should sign their comments with InTheirOwnWords to admit to a certain bias.

The rather strict format of the main entries (described in WebProgrammingTemplateHelp) should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

When adding new entries choose Web``Programming``Template when creating the page.

==== To Do ====

    * The templating systems should really get a different page layout, showing examples etc.
    * Describe PHP and Java in the same format as quite a few will want to compare to them anyway
    * Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?

Editor: DanielDittmar (this means only that I will adapt the entries to changes in the WebProgrammingTemplate and that I will try to keep the version entries current)

== Discussion ==

For a set of comparisons of my real-world experiences with a bunch of the web solutions described on this page, check my WebSolutionComparison page.  These are NOT impartial and unbiased comparisons; these are my personal experiences from building real web sites.  Feel free to add your own comparisons.

-- TimRoberts

Wait- I don't understand-

Why were BaseHttpServer, DocXmlRpcServer, CgiScripts taken out?

I'd think that on a page on WebProgramming, those things would be listed.

-- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2004-08-02T14:36:38Z)]]

Other things:

 * The reorganisation is presumably to help people find the right framework - things like simple CGI-based APIs might not be cutting edge stuff, but they're potentially very useful if you don't have a "full" hosting account.
 * I didn't really agree with some aspects of the revised classifications. I think the template systems need their own page, and the multiple classifications really need banishing to another page where they'll confuse only the experts.

-- PaulBoddie

I'm afraid we need more fine-grained classification. It is unclear which of these components can be used together with others (say: is [http://www.chrisarndt.de/en/software/python/#auth Auth modules] compatible with CGI
or mod_python?

-- Michal J. Gajda

If you want web programming to be more accessible, maybe you should avoid titles like "Variable Insertion-Replacement Templating Applications"?

-- FredrikLundh

I would expect Wiki technology to be included here.  Seems ironic that MoinMoin is not mentioned on this page!  (Other than here ... ;)
