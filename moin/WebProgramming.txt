'''or, more aptly put, Web ''Server'' Programming''' 

See also: 
 * WebClientProgramming
 * DatabaseProgramming (guidance on available DatabaseInterfaces and related tools)
 * ["PythonAndJ2EE"] (comparison of various frameworks to J2EE)

This topic guide links to the frameworks and templating systems available for Web programming in Python.

==== Notes on Editing ====

Opinions based on experience are welcome, but framework or templating system authors should sign their comments with InTheirOwnWords to admit to a certain bias.

The rather strict format of the main entries (described in WebProgrammingTemplateHelp) should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

When adding new entries choose Web``Programming``Template when creating the page.

==== To Do ====
    * The templating systems should really get a different page layout, showing examples etc.
    * describe PHP and Java in the same format as quite a few will want to compare to them anyway
    * Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?

Editor: DanielDittmar (this means only that I will adapt the entries to changes in the WebProgrammingTemplate and that I will try to keep the version entries current)
