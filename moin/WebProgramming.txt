This topic guide started out as a word by word copy of PaulBoddie's 
[http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/web_frameworks.html Python Web Frameworks Overview]. Putting it into Wiki format hopefully allows more people to contribute. 

The main purpose of this topic guide is to help in choosing between the plethora of frameworks and templating systems for Web programming, without having to learn each of them. In addition, information about different PresentationTechnologies is also provided, where appropriate, since this can be a major deciding factor in choosing a framework.

Opinions based on experience are welcome, but framework or templating system authors should sign their comments with InTheirOwnWords to admit to a certain bias.

The rather strict format of the main entries (described in WebProgrammingTemplateHelp) should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

When adding new entries choose Web``Programming``Template when creating the page.

There is an '''ALTERNATIVE''' classification of technologies below the one that follows immediately. The alternative classification section is '''up-to-date as of 2003-02-11'''

The Web Framework Shootout (at http://colorstudy.com/docs/shootout.html) also covers several of these frameworks.

    * ZPT (["Zope"])
    * Extended XSLT (["4Suite"])
    * [http://www.chrisarndt.de/en/software/python/index.html#PyEmb PyEmb] Embed Python code into any kind of text. Can be used as preprocessor or a CGI script for serving template files.

==== Web services ====
    * [http://pywebsvcs.sf.net Python Web Services] a SourceForge "meta-project" for Python web services programming

==== To Do ====
    * The templating systems should really get a different page layout, showing examples etc.
    * describe PHP and Java in the same format as quite a few will want to compare to them anyway
    * Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?

Editor: DanielDittmar (this means only that I will adapt the entries to changes in the WebProgrammingTemplate and that I will try to keep the version entries current)

= Currently Hardly Considered =

== Python-based Web Client Programming ==

There is probably a huge amount of good stuff available from the people who are working actively with XML-RPC, Biztalk and other approaches to web services. More too from XML writes like Uche Ogbuji, who has put much good stuff on IBM's developerworks site, among other things.

Sadly nobody has categorised or classified it in the Wiki, so at the moment we have to scratch around.

== Object Persistance and Object Relational Layers ==

See DatabaseProgramming for some guidance on available DatabaseInterfaces and related tools.
