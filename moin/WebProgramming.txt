This topic guide is a word by word copy of Paul Boddie's 
[http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/web_frameworks.html Python Web Frameworks Overview]. Putting it into Wiki format hopefully allows more people to contribute. 

The main purpose of this topic guide is to help in choosing a framework for web programming without having to learn each of them. In addition, information about different PresentationTechnologies is also provided, where appropriate, since this can be a major deciding factor in choosing a framework.

Opinions based on experience are welcome, but framework authors should sign their comments with InTheirOwnWords to admit to a certain bias.

The rather strict format of the main entries (described in WebProgrammingTemplateHelp) should not been seen as a limit. Feel free to add new pages containing examples, direct comparisons etc.

What is missing:
    * direct comparisons by example between the various template libraries
    * development turnaround: must the server be restarted and how long does this take?
    * debugging support
    * multi protocol servers like ["Zope"] and TwistedMatrix aren't really discussed yet

Known frameworks:
    * ["Zope"]
    * WebWare
    * SkunkWeb
    * TwistedMatrix
    * ["Quixote"]
    * ["Albatross"]
    * JonsPythonModules
    * ["Spyce"]
    * CherryPy
    * ["maki"]
    * ClearSilver
    * ScriptFoundryModules
    * ["Slither"]
    * add new entries (choose Web``Programming``Template when creating the page)
    * shouldn't PHP and Java servlets be mentioned in the same format as quite a few will want to compare to them anyway?

Is there any interest in a WebProgrammingShootOut?

Editor: DanielDittmar (this means only that I will adapt the entries to changes in the WebProgrammingTemplate and that I will try to keep the version entries current)
