DreamPie is a graphical interactive Python shell which is designed to be reliable and fun. Check it out at http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/

== Richer function documentation ==

This is a feature from IPython which is frequently requested. I think that the model should be Eclipse - when you type a paren after a function name it opens a yellow popup window which displays its argument and a bit of documentation, and lets you make it a real window by pressing F2.

== Complete module names ==

This was a bug report by cool-RR: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dreampie/+bug/525610

IPython completes module names. That's a good idea.

== More by cool-RR: Complete things that aren't defined yet ==

Imagine I'm writing this function:

def factorial(n):
    import random
    random.whatever()
    return n * factorial(n-1)

I'd want DreamPie to autocomplete both the `whatever` thing and the use of `factorial` inside the definition. Probably hard, I know.
