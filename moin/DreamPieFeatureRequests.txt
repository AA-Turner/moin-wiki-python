== Richer function documentation ==

This is a feature from IPython which is frequently requested. I think that the model should be Eclipse - when you type a paren after a function name it opens a yellow popup window which displays its argument and a bit of documentation, and lets you make it a real window by pressing F2.

== Complete module names ==

This was a bug report by cool-RR: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dreampie/+bug/525610

IPython completes module names. That's a good idea.
