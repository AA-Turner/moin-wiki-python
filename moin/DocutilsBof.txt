The Docutils Birds-of-a-Feather session will be a chance to talk about Docutils, and put faces to names.  It's tentatively scheduled for 8pm on Wednesday March 24 (see PyConBofs).  Contact: [mailto:goodger@python.org David Goodger].

Topics?  Anything goes.  We could have a report on the DocutilsSprint.  Add further topics here.
