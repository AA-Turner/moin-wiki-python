PyConDC2004 is over.  The Docutils BoF session saw about 20 people attending.  I described the results of the sprint, then opened the floor for discussion.  Got some good ideas.  I'll post a summary here shortly.

See [http://starship.python.net/~goodger/pycon_dc_2004/ A Week at PyCon DC 2004] for a narrative account of events.

For posterity's sake, here's the original text:

The Docutils Birds-of-a-Feather session will be a chance to talk about Docutils, and put faces to names.  It's tentatively scheduled for 8pm on Wednesday March 24 (see PyConBofs).  Contact: [mailto:goodger@python.org David Goodger].

Topics?  Anything goes.  We could have a report on the DocutilsSprint.  Add further topics here.
