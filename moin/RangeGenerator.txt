Below is a little little range generator, irange, which is compatible with range.  More specifically, {{{[i for i in irange(*args)] == range(*args)]}}}.  This will let us iterator over large spans of numbers without resorting to ["xrange"], which is a lazy list as opposed to  a generator.

Would a function of similar semantics likely be accepted into the standard library within itertools?

["lwickjr"]: I like the idea. Anyone else?

The author doesn't have the time/energy to write/push a ["PEP"] for the PythonEnhancementProcess.  If you think this generator is a good idea, please submit a ["PEP"].

["lwickjr"]: Neither do I. Anyone else?

Perhaps a simple implementation can be constructed using *count* and *islice* from intertools?. -- Anon

I think it's way too much code, and also it does not accept named parameters. How about this? -- JÃ¼rgenHermann [[DateTime(2005-10-19T20:06:52Z)]]

''The alternate implementation is fine, though I'd prefer to see a "takewhile" rather than a while loop in the spirit of functional programming - but thats minor.  

The test case I am less fond of - while it does test the functionality, it doesn't support TestDrivenDevelopment as well.  It would be nice to have a test from unitest to allow someone building a big system to easily run a suite of tests they like. 

Next step write a PEP someone?
