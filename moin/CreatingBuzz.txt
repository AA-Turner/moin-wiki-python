In order for PyCon to have a large attendance, the word must get out.  This page is meant to contain a rough list of sites/lists/people/etc. that should be kept abreast of PyCon planning in order to help promote the conference.  Also any other general notes should go on this page.

* Blogs
   * Basically need people to mention it, hype it, and ask others to do the same
* Sites
   * Slashdot
   * LWN
   * Daily Python URL
* Newsgroups
   * c.l.py
* Mailing Lists
   * python-dev Summaries
   * Dr. Dobb's Weekly Python-URL
   * python-announce

IMHO better target specialized audience like Zope/WebApplicationServer, .NET etc.
with targeted messages in newsgroups with PyCon track referencies.
