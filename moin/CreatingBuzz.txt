In order for PyCon to have a large attendance, the word must get out.  This page is meant to contain a rough list of sites/lists/people/etc. that should be kept abreast of PyCon planning in order to help promote the conference.  Also any other general notes should go on this page.

 * Blogs
   * Basically need people to mention it, hype it, and ask others to do the same
 * Sites
   * Slashdot
   * LWN
   * Daily Python URL
   * http://www.linuxpr.com/
   * http://www.prweb.com/
   * http://newsforge.com/submit.pl
   * http://www.pressbox.co.uk
 * Newsgroups
   * c.l.py
 * Mailing Lists
   * python-dev Summaries
   * Dr. Dobb's Weekly Python-URL
   * python-announce
   * Press announcement list on pythonology.org
 * Groups
   * Local Linux/Unix user groups.

IMHO better target specialized audience like Zope/WebApplicationServer, .NET etc.
with targeted messages in newsgroups with PyCon track referencies.

The FOSDEM conference runs brief interviews with various presenters.  See http://lwn.net/Articles/63094/ for links to three of them.  It would be an excellent idea to do the same for PyCon.  We should also set up a link to all blogs covering PyCon while it's happening. --amk

Press releases are still a good idea.  See PyCon2004PressRelease. --StephanDeibel
