= Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity? =
Python 3 is strongly recommended for any new development. As of January 2020, [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/|Python 2 has reached End Of Life status]], meaning it will receive no further updates or bugfixes, including for security issues. Many frameworks and other add on projects are following a similar policy. As such, we can only recommend learning and teaching Python 3.

= Historical information =
For historical information that may be useful in porting or maintaining remaining Python 2 systems, please see [[https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3?action=recall&rev=96|previous page revisions]].
