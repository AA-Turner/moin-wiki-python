== Strings in Python 2.x ==

Python 2.x has two types that can be used to store a string:
 * {{{str}}}: raw byte data; each element represents a single byte, which can range in value from 0-255.  This is the default type for string literals, which is widely considered to be a mistake due to the encoding problems it raises (for more information, see Joel Spolsky's [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets]).
 * {{{unicode}}}: a string in which each element represents a unicode character.

Both classes have the same methods and are very similar.

== Strings in Python 3000 ==

Python 3000 uses two very different types:
 * {{{bytes}}}: similar, but not identical, to Python 2.x's {{{str}}} type.  It is intended to represent raw byte data.  For more information on this type, please consult [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0358/ PEP 358].
 * {{{str}}}: a unicode character string which is exactly the same type as Python 2.x's {{{unicode}}} type.

== Differences Between Python 2.x's "str" and Python 3000's "bytes" ==

Differences between Python 2.x's {{{str}}} and Python 3000's {{{bytes}}}include:
 * {{{str}}} is immutable, whereas {{{bytes}}} is mutable.
 * {{{bytes}}} "lacks" many methods present in {{{str}}}: {{{strip()}}}, {{{lstrip()}}}, {{{rstrip()}}}, {{{lower()}}}, {{{upper()}}}, {{{splitlines()}}}, etc.
 * indexing an item of a {{{bytes}}} object yields an ''integer'', not a bytes object, whereas indexing an item of a Python 2.x {{{str}}} yields another {{{str}}} instance.

== Choosing Between "bytes" and "str" in Python 3000 ==

When you migrate from Python 2.x to Python 3000, you have to ask yourself: do I manipulate characters or bytes (integers)? "A" is a character and 65 is an integer. Examples:

 * a network socket manipulates bytes
 * a text parser manipulates characters (use lower, strip, etc. methods)

== Iterating over "bytes" ==

It's important to note that the {{{bytes}}} iterator generates integers and not characters:

{{{
>>> for item in b'abc':
...   print item
97
98
99
}}}

== Comparing "bytes" ==

Comparing one {{{bytes}}} object to another works as expected:

{{{
>>> b'xyz' == b'xyz'
True
>>> b'xyz' == b'abc'
False
}}}

However, it is important to note that the {{{bytes}}} type is completely distinct from the {{{str}}} type in Python 3000, and comparisons between them do ''not'' work:

{{{
>>> b'xyz' == 'xyz'
False
}}}

As mentioned earlier, getting an item of a bytes returns an integer, not a bytes object:

{{{
>>> b'xyz'[0] == b'x'
False
>>> b'xyz'[0]
120
}}}

This behaviour is different than Python 2.x:

{{{
# In Python 2.x
>>> "xyz"[0]
'x'
>>> type("xyz"), type("xyz"[0])
(<type 'str'>, <type 'str'>)
}}}

=== Hashing "bytes" ===

{{{bytes}}} is mutable, and as a result, it's not hashable.  Among other things, this means that {{{bytes}}} objects can't be used as keys in dictionaries.

Hacks and workarounds for this include:
 * use {{{buffer(value)}}}

Other solutions include:
 * create an immutable {{{frozenbytes}}} type
 * avoid using hash
