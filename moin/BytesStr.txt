Python 2.x has two types to store a string:
 * str: bytes string procced as character string which is a mistake
 * unicode: character string (unicode)

Both classes has same methods and are very similar.

Python 3000 use two very different types:
 * bytes: bytes string which can be see as a list of [0..255] integers
 * str: character string (unicode), exactly the same type than Python 2.x "unicode"

Differences between Python 2.x "str" and Python 3000 "bytes":
 * str is immutable, bytes is mutable
 * bytes "lacks" many methods: strip, lstrip, rstrip, lower, upper, etc.

When you migration from Python 2.x to Python 3000, you have to ask youself: do I manipulate characters or integers (bytes)? A is a character and 65 is an integer. Examples:
 * a network socket manipulate bytes
 * a text parser manipulates characters (use lower, strip, etc. methods)
