We are employing the Tom Sawyer application development methodology in this educational sprint. Come join us to learn (with us) how to build and package Plone products for easy deployment. The application we are developing uses Plone as a front end to the Postgres database. The outcome of this sprint will be a school administration application that can be used by educational institutions to manage online courses and track student performance. 


The CanDo project [http://cando.sourceforge.net/]; is an open source Competency Tracking Tool that will allow educators to track the specific compentencies of their students and generate the required reports for their state as to the students' satisfaction of those competencies.  Additionally the students will have the opportunity to follow links to on-line curriculum for any given competency.  Students will also have the ability to post evidence that will be linked to a given competency, thus creating a portfolio that they can build throughout their career.
