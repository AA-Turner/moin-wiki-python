The CanDo project [http://cando.schooltool.net]; is an open source Competency Tracking Tool that will allow educators to track the specific competencies of their students and generate the required reports for their state as to the students' satisfaction of those competencies.

Additionally, students will have the opportunity to follow links to on-line curriculum for any given competency.  Students will also have the ability to post evidence that will be linked to a given competency, thus creating a portfolio that they can build throughout their career.

The project is now in its third year of development and will be deployed in a statewide pilot program next year in Virginia.
