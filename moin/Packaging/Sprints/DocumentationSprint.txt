== Sprint Goals ==

 * start to re-work the doc that lives outside the packaging folder, that refers to installing/building stuff
 * (./) reorganize the doc into sections:
   * end-users
   * developers
   * package managers

== Requirements ==

Clone Tarek's cpython fork from Bitbucket and brush up on reStructuredText and Sphinx.

=== Hg repository ===

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/tarek/cpython
Most work will take place under the cpython/Doc/packaging/ directory. 

=== Markup and doc generation ===

Docs are written using reStructuredText markup and auto-generated using Sphinx.
 * [[http://sphinx.pocoo.org/| Sphinx]]
 * [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html| reStructuredText]]


== Hosting ==

Most sprinters will be working remotely, feel free to meetup in small groups and update details here.


== Updates ==

== Sprint Report Day 1 ==

Today was pretty productive as we managed to get the docs building without errors or warnings using the cpython method of building the docs. 

=== Major Changes ===

 * removed Doc/packaging/conf.py
   * docs will be built using the standard cpython build process, this local sphinx conf.py is no longer required
 * removed updated pkgutil.rst doc from Doc/packaging/
   * relocate under Doc/library/pkgutil.rst?
 * disabled use of the Sphinx autodoc plugin (automodule, autoclass, etc)
   * Seems we cannot use the autodoc plugin without some changes to how we build cpython docs. We mainly need sphinx Python 3 support so features like automodule works.
 * docs have been split up between 3 directories:
   * enduser
   * developer
   * packager 
 * changed the labels within Doc/packaging/ to use _packaging as a prefix.
   * make it clear we are referencing packaging and not distutils
   * label names must be unique in the entire documentation source
   {{{
   .. _metadata becomes .. _packaging-metadata
   }}}
 * added the index directive at the top of all docs under Doc/packaging/packaging/
   * prevents duplicate objects, distutils and packaging conflict when generating the index.
   {{{ 
   .. index:: module: packaging
   }}}
 * used sed to search and replace occurrences of distutils, distutils2, and Distutils2
   * s/Disutils2/Packaging/g
   * s/distutils2/packaging/g
   * s/distutils/packaging/g 
   

== Sprint Report Day 2 ==

Work continues on normalizing how we use Sphinx and reST in the packaging docs.

=== Who's working on what? ===

 * Kelsey is working on Sphinx related fixes and improvements.
 * Guillermo is working on improving the readability of the enduser docs.
