=== Python packaging discussion ===

The way packaging in Python works is currently undergoing big changes. This page tries to summarise the
discussion, proposals and ideas that might be incorporated into the PEPs listed below.

If you have an idea, or a use case that is not (sufficiently) supported right now, we would
like to know about it and encourage you to add it to the '''Ideas & Use cases''' section of
this page.

=== PEPS ===

List of packaging related PEPs that are under consideration:

 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0376/|PEP 376 - Changing the .egg-info structure]]
 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0382/|PEP 382 - Namespace Packages]]
 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/|PEP 386 - Changing the version comparison module in Distutils]]
 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0390/|PEP 390 - Static metadata for Distutils]]

=== Proposals ===

== Accepted ==

== Under consideration ==

 * [[Distutils/DiscussionOverview/FilePrefixes | Prefix handling for installed files ]]
 * [[Distutils/DiscussionOverview/PrefixClasses | Prefix classes ]]
 * [[Distutils/DiscussionOverview/DefaultInstallScheme | Change default installation scheme ]]

=== Ideas & Use cases ===

== Data file installation paths ==

It is not possible to retrieve the installation paths of data, or other, files for all installation 
schemes supported by distutils right now. I propose the inclusion of a PREFIX file within the 
.egg-info directory that holds information on all prefixes set at installation time and a suitable
API within pkgutil.

'''Discussion''':  [[Distutils/DiscussionOverview/FilePrefixes]]

'''Status''': Under Consideration

'''Affected PEPs''': 376


== Data file prefix classes/placeholders ==

Data files shipped within a distribution are not further classified. This makes it impossible
to define default installation paths for certain file types that are typically shipped with
a distribution like configuration files, examples, shared data files, ...

'''Discussion''':  [[Distutils/DiscussionOverview/PrefixClasses]]

'''Status''': Under Consideration

'''Affected PEPs''': 376

== Change the default installation paths ==

Distribute packaged distributions get installed into the system paths, that are typically under
the aegis of the system's package manager. I propose to change the default installation scheme 
to the (PEP 370) `--user` one.
