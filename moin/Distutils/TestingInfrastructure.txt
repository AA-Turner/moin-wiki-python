One of the big challenges for Python going forward is addressing all the different platforms that packages are destined for.

Typically, the seem to include:

 - Windows
 - Mac
 - *nix

To complicate the problem, there are now many versions of each operating system.

Multiply those two combinations by all of the versions of Python that already exist (not to mention the ones coming) and we start to that we are heading into complexity.

The most efficient way to address the problems of multiple packages on so many different versions of python and on so many operating systems is to employ server farm virtual environment building infrastructure.

In simple terms, we need to build all the packages that exist for Python on a daily basis on all of the environments and report any issues back to the registered maintainers.
