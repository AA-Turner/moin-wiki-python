This page describes the work done in order to change the Distutils Metadata.

PEP References : 

 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0241/|PEP 241]] Metadata 1.0 for Python Software Packages
 * [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0376/|PEP 314]] Metadata 1.1 for Python Software Packages

We are working on a new version for PEP 345. Jim started a branch (jim-update-345)

what has been said:

 * deprecate Requires/Provides/OBsolete.
 * add install_requires 
 * deprecate the MANIFEST.in template system in favor of a more powerfull pakage_data 
 * list all the arguments that are passed to vairous commands through setup.py that should land into the new metadata description
 * see if we want to have a new "python version" metadata  (it's a trove classifier right now)
