= A list of Distutils-related Project =
Please add a listing to this page if you're working on Distutils (and help us reduce duplication of effort).

== PyPI ==
The central repository of Python package metadata and distribution files. See: CheeseShopDev

== Easy Install ==
A Python package manager that downloads, builds, installs, upgrades, and switches between package versions automatically (using Python Eggs).
See: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

== Python Eggs ==
An effort to produce single-file distributions of packages similar to Java JARs.
See: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs

== Paver ==
[[http://www.blueskyonmars.com/projects/paver/|Paver]]: Easy Scripting for Software Projects

== PEPs for extending distutils / PyPI ==
PEPs 262 "Database of Installed Python Packages" and 345  "Metadata for Python Software Packages 1.2" are currently open

== Uraga ==
An effort to develop a tool for download and installation of packages.
See: http://www.byteofpython.info/projects/uraga/uraga.html

== zpkgtools ==
A source-based packaging system.
See: http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zpkgtools/

== stdeb ==
Build debian source packages using setuptools and the "sdist" distutils command.
See: http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/tree/master

== Distribute ==
[[Distribute]] A community-driven project that aims to gather all requirements for a future distribution package.

== Other efforts we know about ==
 * Ian Bicking is looking to clean up and extend the use of release_urls in PyPI for use in [[http://pythonpaste.org|Paste]].

 * Maurice Ling is looking at implementing PEP 262 as an academic project.

 * Geoffrey T. Dairiki has a bdist_deb command http://bugs.python.org/1054967

 * [[http://www.egenix.com/|eGenix]] uses its own extensions to distutils in the various egenix-mx packages called mxSetup.py. Among other things this module contains support for building Unix libraries, limited autoconf support, uninstall command and a clever build_ext command that allows to disable building extensions/packages from the command line and also supports building optional extensions (depending on the availability of certain include and library files).
