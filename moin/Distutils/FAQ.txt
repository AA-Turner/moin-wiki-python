=== General Questions ===

==== Can you use distutils (i.e., your setup.py file) to '''un'''install a given package? ====
Unfortunately, no. There is a [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/Proposals/UninstallCommand|proposal]] for this, and this would be a useful feature to have though... However, the KDE group has written a [[http://www.simonzone.com/software/pykdeextensions/en/distutils-uninstall.html|wrapper]] for distutils that adds a simple uninstall command.
