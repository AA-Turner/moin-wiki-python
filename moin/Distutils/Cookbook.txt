 * [[Distutils/Cookbook/InstallDataScattered]] -- make resource data-files get installed in the same directory tree as the Python files that depend on them
 * [[Distutils/Cookbook/AutoDataDiscovery]] -- specify data-files to install with smart_install_data recursively by specifying only a top-level directory
 * [[Distutils/Cookbook/AutoPackageDiscovery]] -- specify packages to install recursively by specifying only the top-level package

 * [[Distutils/Cookbook/WininstFilename]] -- provide customisation point for altering the filename of bdist_wininst installer (such as to include numpy version information)
