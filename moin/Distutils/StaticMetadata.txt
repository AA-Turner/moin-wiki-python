This page discuss the way to separate the metadata in a static PKG-INFO like file.


 * write a best practice guide

 * use the distutils.dist.DistutilsMetadata as a basis for a read/write API [http://bugs.python.org/file12746/get_metadata.diff| an example]

 * think about the dynamic metadata issue (can we provide something for that ?)
