This page discuss the way to separate the metadata in a static PKG-INFO like file.


 * use the distutils.dist.DistutilsMetadata as a basis to think about a read/write API [[http://bugs.python.org/file12746/get_metadata.diff| an example]]

 * think about the dynamic metadata issue (can we provide something for that ?) 

 * write a best practice guide for people to separate their metadata in a separate file, and use it in their setup.py
