'''Buildout''' is a "system for managing development buildouts", 
according to its [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout home page].
While often identified as a ["Zope"] project, and indeed licensed
under the ["ZPL"] by Zope creator ["Jim Fulton"], '''buildout'''
is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases,
a few that have nothing to do with ["Python"].  The home page
above includes extensive documentation, examples, and more.

[explain relation to easy_install and eggs]

["Martin Aspelli"]'s book on ["Plone"] 3 includes a good reference
on '''buildout'''.
