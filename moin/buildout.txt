'''Buildout''' is a "system for managing development buildouts", 
according to its [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout home page].
While often identified as a ["Zope"] project, and indeed licensed
under the ["ZPL"] by Zope creator ["Jim Fulton"], '''buildout'''
is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases,
a few that have nothing to do with ["Python"].  The home page
above includes extensive documentation, examples, and more.

At one level, buildout (still referred to as "zc.buildout" 
on occasion) manages ["egg"]s.

and '''virtualenv.py'''; explain usage]

Other treatments of '''buildout''' include:

 * ["Martin Aspelli"]'s book on ["Plone"] 3, which includes a good reference on '''buildout''';
 * the Zope 3 Wiki includes a [http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/UsingBuildout useful page] on the subject;
 * Jim wrote a [http://grok.zope.org/minitutorials/buildout.html tutorial];
 * [wiki:/pycon2008_tutorial Tutorial class for PyCon 2008]

A proposal is being floated to create a more professional site for buildout.  At a first step, let's [wiki:/buildout_newsite_notes collect notes] on what such a site would contain.
