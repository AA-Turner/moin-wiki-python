'''Buildout''' is a "system for managing development buildouts", 
according to its [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout home page].
While often identified as a ["Zope"] project, and indeed licensed
under the ["ZPL"] by Zope creator ["Jim Fulton"], '''buildout'''
is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases,
a few that have nothing to do with ["Python"].  The home page
above includes extensive documentation, examples, and more.

Other treatments of '''buildout''' include:

 * ["Martin Aspelli"]'s book on ["Plone"] 3, which includes a good reference on '''buildout''';
 * the Zope 3 Wiki includes a [http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/UsingBuildout useful page] on the subject;
 * Fulton wrote a [http://grok.zope.org/minitutorials/buildout.html tutorial]
