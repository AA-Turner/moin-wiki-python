= Welcome to Pydotorg Central =

This is your source of information for contributing to the python.org website.

To get started working on a local copy of the python.org website, you need to check it out from Subversion.  To check it out for anonymous access (start here if you're new):

    {{{svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org}}}

To check it out with commit privileges:

    {{{svn co svn+ssh://pydotorg@svn.python.org/trunk/beta.python.org}}}

To build and run the site, see build/new-build/README in the checked-out beta.python.org tree.

For extra information, see PythonWebsiteDetails

== How Can I Help? ==

== Old Build System ==

The website build system has been rewritten.  The old build system
was called Pyramid.  This info is being maintained a short time
until the website completely abandons Pyramid:

    * Install Pyramid as described in PythonWebsitePyramidDocs
    * See build/README in the checked out beta.python.org tree. 
    * PythonWebsitePyramidUsersGuide

== Discussion ==

See PythonWebsiteHomePage for discussion on what should be on the home page (some of which has been completed, but not all).

Here is a page for PythonWebsiteMiscSuggestions
