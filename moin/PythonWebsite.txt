= Welcome to Pydotorg Central =

This is your source of information for contributing to the python.org website.

To get started working on a local copy of the python.org website, please install / check out these:

    * Install Pyramid as described in http://pyramid.pollenation.net/cgi-bin/trac.cgi
    * (anonymous) svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org
    * (with commit privileges) svn co svn+ssh://pydotorg@svn.python.org/trunk/beta.python.org 

If you need to convert any content from the old site (there are still some murky depths in the old site format) also get this:

    * svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/pydotorg 

To build and run the site:

    * See build/README in the checked out beta.python.org tree.

== Where do I put assets? (images, files, html pages, etc)? ==

In most cases, place them into the same location as the yml and html template files. Pyramid copies them into place automatically. For html trees, place them into a directory that contains a file called NOBUILD. This tells pyramid to just copy the html files instead of trying to process them.

Site-wide and style related images go into in /images instead.

== Debugging in Wing IDE ==

To debug pyramid in Wing IDE, set up a project, add pyramid (or a copy of it) as the main debug file and set the parameters and starting directory in the File Properties (right click on file or file's name in project view). This can help point at problems when running w/ -V doesn't provide enough info.
