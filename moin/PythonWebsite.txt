= Welcome to Pydotorg Central =

This is your source of information for contributing to the python.org website.

To get started working on a local copy of the python.org website, please install / check out these:

    * Install Pyramid as described in PythonWebsitePyramidDocs
    * (anonymous) svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org
    * (with commit privileges) svn co svn+ssh://pydotorg@svn.python.org/trunk/beta.python.org 

If you need to convert any content from the old site (there are still some murky depths in the old site format) also get this:

    * svn co https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/pydotorg 

To build and run the site:

    * See build/README in the checked out beta.python.org tree.
