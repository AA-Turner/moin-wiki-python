There are various fixes and improvements that should form part of a 2.0 version of Distutils.

 * Move various utility methods out of command implementations and onto the Distribution class.
 * Implement the package database described by PEP 262.
 * Consider always regenerating the MANIFEST from MANIFEST.in.
 * Finish bdist_dpkg.py
 * sdist: Include scripts, data automatically in the source distribution.
 * Drop Python 1.5.2 compatibility. Keep Python 2.0 compatiblity.
 * Improve test coverage.
 * Finish the documentation! (AnthonyBaxter's worked on the docs some, but I don't know where he's at)
 * Package installation from PyPI (probably driven by the pythonmac-sig)

What about package installation from [http://www.python.org/pypi PyPI]? -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2003-10-08T23:14:09Z)]]

 * Add more autoconf-like tests to the config command
 * Make the design more extensible w.r.t. 'foreign' module compilation, specifically:
 * Allow the integration of autoconf/make based build systems for C/C++ extensions
 * Allow 'Extension' to be composed of components, each with their own build rules
 * Provide a means for scripts / modules to access installation parameters such as datafile directories
 * Define more default commands to build documentation, run (unit) tests, etc.

Wouldn't it be a good idea to look into [http://scons.sf.net scons] and try to let both converge as far as practical ? -- StefanSeefeld

Maybe some traditional package concepts:

 * Uninstallation.  Also getting rid of obsolete files when upgrading.
 * Dependencies.  A simple implementation might simply check to see if another library is installed and warn the user if not (and maybe install from PyPI if that feature exists).  Declaring (or worse, resolving) version dependencies or alternatives seems like overkill for now.

 * Easy installation of non-python data files that are stored inside Python packages. Twisted uses this for plugins, it's also useful for storing .glade files together with the code for GTK GUI apps, etc..

 * SciPy has some setup.py scripts that extended distutils. It may be a good idea to look there for ideas.
 * Allow MANIFEST and MANIFEST.in to be located in a directory other than the package root directory.
