== Patrick Harris ==
Basically, I am new to Python Web and Applications Development. My Python knowledge is beginner to novice and I will accept any and all help. I will attempt to help anyone that ask for my help, therefore feel free to contact me at Email: <<MailTo(harrispp64@gmail.com)>>.

My goal is to use Python to extend and/or develop useful technologies to incorporate into Google Wave. However, my work will not end there as I am very adventurous and plan to do all that I can with Python and Ruby...maybe a little C++...yet I will concentrate on Python development at present!

Please always remember that I am no one...yet I am everyone!
