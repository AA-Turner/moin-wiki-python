= Path class Pre-Pre-PEP =

== Implementation(s) ==

Reinhold has modified Jason Orendorff's original path.py to fit discussions in python-dev and comp.lang.python and has placed it in Python CVS under nondist/sandbox/path.

Other implementations to look at include the original, py.path and some things that others have mentioned on c.l.p. and python-dev

== Design Principles ==

1. A Path should be a drop-in replacement for a str or unicode as much as possible.

2. Properties are the interface for immutable attributes of a Path. For example, a Path's basename will be the same regardless of data on the local filesystem.

3. Methods are the interface for mutable attributes, for example, the last-modified-time.
