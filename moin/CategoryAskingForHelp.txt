= CategoryAskingForHelp =

This is the category for pages created as questions for the [[Asking for Help]] page. Pages in this category should appear automatically in the list of questions.

At some point, some additional magic may be required to support the automatic movement of pages to the list of answers on the [[Asking for Help]] page as the questions in these pages get answered.
