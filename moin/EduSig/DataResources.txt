= Relevant, Reusable Data for Education Exercises =

On this page is cataloged common data that may be useful to educators in constructing meaningful exercises.  Often educators short on time use abstract data that lacks meaning to the student, or that requires the student to track down and extract his own data.

Fetch scripts are provided in some cases where the data is too large, changes periodically, or it wouldn't make sense to host it on python.org.  The scripts are kept simple, so that students may benefit from reading them as well as the instructor, although it is expected that usually the instructor will extract the data once, perhaps repackage it and make it available in the classroom.

  If you know ''where'' to obtain the information, in a freely
  reusable form, please provide a link.  Often finding it is
  harder than processing it.

'''Question'''
== SQLite3 Data ==
Would it be OK to provide sqlite3 Databases?

I do have a source of hyphenations under public domain (about 180.000 entries), and I think that sqlite3 (which is in 2.5) would also be nice to use as a data source.
