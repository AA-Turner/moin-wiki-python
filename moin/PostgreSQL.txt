   * Foreign keys
   * Implements all SQL99 join types: inner join, left, right, full outer join, natural join
   * Subqueries
   * UNION and UNION ALL, INTERSECT and EXCEPT
   * Views
   * Triggers
 * Support for international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode
 * Supports many languages for writing server-side functions/procedures and aggregates: Python, C, Perl, Tcl, PL/PgSQL, ...
 * ACID compliant
 * Support for rollback
 * Serializable transaction isolation
 * Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for highly scalable concurrent applications

== Cons ==

== DB API 2.0 Drivers ==

=== PyGreSQL ===

  URL:: http://www.pygresql.org/
  licence:: BSD-like (depends on mxDateTime, which may be GPL-incompatible)
  platforms:: Unix, win32
  Python versions:: 1.5.2 thru 2.4
  Maintenance:: Last version released is 3.8.1 (2006-06-05)

Now incorporates PoPy - see http://zope.org/Members/tm/Full_Announce

=== psycopg ===

  URL:: http://initd.org/software/initd/psycopg
  Licence:: GPL
  Platforms:: Unix, win32 (beta)
  Python versions::
  Maintenance:: Active development, frequent updates (as of 10/2003)

==== Extensions to DB API ====

  * dictfetchone(), dictfetchmany(), dictfechall() methods on the cursor object; these will return dictionaries instead of tuples, so you can access rows by name instead of by index

==== Comments ====

  * Written for heavily multithreaded applications in mind.
  * Offers a few advanced features over PoPy
  * Win32 binaries can be found here http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/psycopg/

=== pyPgSQL ===

  URL:: http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net
  Licence:: BSD-like (depends on mxDateTime, which may be GPL-incompatible)
  Platforms:: Unix, win32
  Python versions:: 2.1 thru 2.3
  Maintenance:: Active, sporatic (as of 10/2003)

==== Extensions to DB API ====

  * The fetch methods on cursors return an instances of PgResultSet, which you can use to access rows by index (like in DB-API), dictionary-like or with attributes. This feature can be turned off for a slight performance boost.
  * Support for PostgreSQL notifications in the low-level API.

----

== Supported Python Applications ==
 * ["Zope"]
 * DbDoc
 * three PostgreSQL drivers (using pgdb, included with the PostgreSQL distro, pypgsql, and psycopg) exist for ["PyDO"] (Python Data Objects)
