The following applications related to version/revision control are written in Python:

== Version Control Systems ==

   * [[http://bazaar-vcs.org/|Bazaar]] (formerly Bazaar-NG)
   * [[http://codeville.org/|Codeville]]
   * [[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/|Mercurial]]

== Abstraction Layers and Tools ==
   
Tools with unified interface to several version control systems.
   * [[http://hg-git.github.com/|Hg-Git]] - access Git repositories from Mercurial
   * [[http://code.google.com/p/pysync/|pysync]] - abstraction layer, looks inactive, but a lot of commits
   * [[https://github.com/alex/pyvcs|pyvcs (Alex Gaynor and co.)]] - pure python abstraction layer of multiple VCS, very lightweight
   * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vcs/|vcs]] - another abstraction layer, seems to be MIT licensed

== Migration Tools ==

   * [[http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/|cvs2svn]] - the CVS to Subversion repository converter
   * [[http://progetti.arstecnica.it/tailor|Tailor]] - a tool to migrate changesets between ArX, Bazaar, Bazaar-NG, CVS, Codeville, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, Subversion and Tla repositories

== Repository Browsers ==

   * [[http://trac.edgewall.org/|Trac]] supports repository browsing
   * [[http://www.viewvc.org/|ViewVC]] (formerly ViewCVS) - a repository browser for CVS and Subversion
