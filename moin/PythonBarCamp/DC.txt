= DC-Area Python Camp =

== Goals ==

 * 2-day event, held on a weekend in October or November 2008.
 * Held in the DC or Baltimore area.
 * Will feature 1 track of self-scheduled talks, and at least 3-4 sprints, up to as many as we have room for.
 * ~50 attendees maximum.
 * Free admission, or admission <$10.
 * Do we want to have swag, in the form of a T-shirt or tote bag?

== Possible venues ==

DC:

 * [http://www.washingtonparks.net/parkscenter.html Josephine Butler Parks Center], near U Street.
 * U. of Maryland College Park
 * GWU (CS dept, or Cafritz Center)
 * Another DC-area university?
 * Look for a hotel (downtown; near Courthouse or Ballston?)

Baltimore:

 * JHU CS dept.

== Current tasks ==

E-mail possible CS department contacts

 * JHU: Michael Droettboom
 * GWU: [http://seas.gwu.edu/~simha/ Rahul Simha] (supervised a project called $ython).
 * U. of MD: Bijan Parsia?
 * Howard: [http://www.scs.howard.edu/faculty_staff.aspx faculty listing]
 * U. of DC: [http://www.udc.edu/academics/soe/faculty.htm faculty listing]

Research hotel prices in the fall: Baltimore vs. DC; is one city much cheaper?

What to do about wireless, which is critical?  Bring it in?  Rely on the venue's wireless? 
What if it fails, which would cripple us?

== Budget notes ==

Assuming 50 attendees: 
{{{
 1500? Venue
  500? Projector rental
 1500  Food for 50 attendees ($15 x 50 attendees x 2 days)
  250  Contingency 
  250  Equipment (power strips, etc.)
  250  Printing
---------------------------
 4250  Total
}}}

Charging $10 admission to 50 people only brings in $500; we'd need to charge at least $80 to break even.
Maybe we should just forget about charging admission and look for sponsorship instead.
