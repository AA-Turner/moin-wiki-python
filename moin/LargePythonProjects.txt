This page grew out of a frequently asked question on CompLangPython:
 ''Are there any large projects written in Python?''

While the answer is unambiguously '''Yes!''', it's a little bit trickier than that. For instance, we needed some clear way of defining ''how'' large a project is. And there were issues about people who wanted/didn't want attribution, and projects whose existence had to be kept secret (if we told you, we'd have to kill you...).


We decided to use [[http://starship.python.net/crew/gherman/playground/pycount/|pycount]] to size the programs, and arbitrarily declared that any program of more than 10,000 lines was "large".

The following list is the result of that effort. Please feel free to add YOUR project as well!
