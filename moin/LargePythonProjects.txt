This page grew out of a frequently asked question on CompLangPython:
 ''Are there any large projects written in Python?''

While the answer is unambiguously '''Yes!''', it's a little bit trickier than that. For instance, we needed some clear way of defining ''how'' large a project is. And there were issues about people who wanted/didn't want attribution, and projects whose existance had to be kept secret (if we told you, we'd have to kill you...).

We decided to use [http://starship.python.net/crew/gherman/playground/pycount/ pycount] to size the programs, and arbitrarily declared that any program of more than FILL_THIS_IN lines was "large".

The following list is the result of that effort. Please feel free to add YOUR project as well! '''But not yet!'''
