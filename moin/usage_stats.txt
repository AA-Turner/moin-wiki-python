"A page for ideas on gathering statistics about how Python is used."

The motivation is to help during discussions about Python where a consensus isn't available.  Anecdotes usually fall short in that case.

Ideally, we'd be able to break data down into various groupings, and consider both totals and percentages.

== Data Groupings ==

 * new development vs. stable code-bases
 * categories (web, scripts, "big data", computation, etc.)
 * "bare metal" vs. on top of some framework
 * regional usage

== Solutions for Gathering Usage Statistics ==

 * data from PyPI (a.k.a. the cheeseshop)
 * search results (incl. google, code search sites)
 * 

== Usage Categories ==

An unsubstantiated of how Python is used:

=== Heavy ===

 * web applications
 * scripting and tooling
 * high-performance computation
 * testing (non-Python/embedded/whatever code)

=== Medium ===

 * 

=== Light ===

 * games

== Other thoughts ==

 * Data from PyPI or google will likely not include closed-source usage.
