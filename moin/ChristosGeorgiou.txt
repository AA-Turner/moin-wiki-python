Christos "TZOTZIOY" Georgiou

Email: tzot@sil-tec.gr

I am actually working for the SGI dealers for the general area of the Balcans plus Malta and Cyprus.  I've been developping with C and databases since 1989 (main experience with Ingres database), and I have worked a lot as a sysadm and netadm (sp? anyway, the guy that makes networks working and in a secure way).  I guess that's all the basic background one would like to know about me[0].  Plus that whenever I can, I like to make people laugh (or smile).

PS In case you wonder, consider TZOTZIOY as just a unique tag, or ask google :)

[0] I also have a 8.5 inch disk.  A floppy, that is.
