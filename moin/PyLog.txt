PyLog seems to cluttered :)

== PyLog as interface to SWI Prolog ==

Pylog is an interface to SWI Prolog for Python. Originally written by 
[http://www.flyn.org/projects/Pylog/index.html W. Michael Petullo]. 
Gocept company adopted it to work with swipl 0.4 and released as 
[http://www.gocept.com/angebot/opensource/Pylog open source]. Also the returned data structures are much better.

Current stable version of [http://www.swi-prolog.org/ SWI Prolog] is 5.2.13.
What is 0.4? Gocept site looks updated, however. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2004-02-12T23:28:45Z)]]

== PyLog as first order logic library ==

== Discussion ==

I was looking for a better way of using Prolog - that is: ''How can I use Prolog in the 21st century ?''  I think one would need an integration with an ''imperative language'' so that one can ''glue'' things together in a simple and natural way; I read some prolog books and when they started about (e.g.) ''loops'' it quickly got very ugly. [[BR]]
Secondly it seems to me that I couldn't use anything anymore that would be Wiki:ObjectOriented that is e.g.: [[BR]] 
If you have one database about one think, how can you combine that with another one with getting into name confict.  (I hope someone finds a better example - to make the point that I am thinking of more than just ''namespaces''!) [[BR]]
If someone reads this, please send me an email to `haase` ''at'' `msg` ''dot'' `ucsf` ''dot'' `edu` - Cheers. -- SebastianHaase
