Describe PyLog here.

Pylog is an interface to SWI Prolog for Python. Originally written by W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org> we adopted it to work with swipl 0.4. Also the returned data structures are much better.

Question: How does the above ''W. Michael Petullo '' relate to [http://christophe.delord.free.fr/en/index.html Christophe Delord] ?

I (Sebastian Haase) was looking for a better way of using Prolog - that is: ''How can I use Prolog in the 21st century ?''  I think one would need an integration with an ''imperative language'' so that one can ''glu'' things together in a simple and natural way; I read some prolog books and when they started about (e.g.) ''loops'' it quickly got very ugly.
Secondly it seems to me that I couldn't use anything anymore that would be ObjectOriented; that is e.g.: If you have one database about one think, how can you combine that with another one with getting into name confict.  (I hope someone finds a better example - to make the point that I am thinking of more than just ''namespaces'' !)
If someone reads this, please send me an email to `haase` ''at'' `msg` ''dot'' `ucsf` ''dot'' `edu` - Cheers.
