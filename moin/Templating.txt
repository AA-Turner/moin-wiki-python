= Templating in Python =
<<TableOfContents(2)>>

Templating, and in particular web templating is a way to represent data in different forms. These forms often (but not always) intended to be readable, even attractive, to a human audience. Frequently, templating solutions involve a document (the template) and data. Template usually looks much like the final output, with placeholders instead of actual data (or example data in simplified form), bears common style and visual elements. Data which is presented using that template may be also separated in two parts - data required to be rendered, and data required for template itself (navigation elements if it is a site, button names if it is some UI). Combining template+data produces the final output which is usually (but not always) a web page of some kind.

== Templating Engines ==
There are many, many different HTML/XML templating packages and modules for Python that provide different feature sets and syntaxes. These libraries usually assume that you know how to write HTML or XML.

The number of templating engines is so great because the mechanisms involved are pretty easy to write in Python, at least for a fairly basic template engine; [[http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52305/|this recipe from the Python Cookbook]] shows how easy it is.

=== Engines using Value Substitution ===
The simplest form of templating engine is that which merely substitutes values into a template in order to produce the final output. They sometimes provide tags for if statements or loops, but they are crude.

 * [[https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#template-strings|string.Template (python 3.x)]] in the python standard library.
 * [[http://www.stringtemplate.org/|stringtemplate]] - employs recursion in order to provide support for complicated templating whilst avoiding side-effects
 * [[http://mustache.github.com/|mustache]] - logic-less templates based on [[http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/|CTemplate]] with implementation in many languages including Python
 * [[https://github.com/mll/ctemplate-python|ctemplate-python]] - fast templating with simple if/loop logic based on  [[http://libctemplate.sourceforge.net|libCtemplate]]

=== Engines Mixing Logic into Templates ===
A popular approach with templating engines is to embed logic or control-flow statements into the templates themselves in a way that can make the the final output appear rather different from the original template. For example:

{{{
<table>
  <%
  for item in items:
    %>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td><%= item.name %></td>
    </tr>
    <%
  %>
</table>
}}}
The introduction of such logic may also cause problems for some XML-based tools. Despite these shortcomings, such templating engines may be more applicable to non-Web templating problems or for situations where separating logic from content may actually make the solution harder to understand.

=== Engines with Annotated Templates ===
The following engines feature template documents whose sections are marked using special attributes (or, less frequently, special elements or tags). For example:

{{{
<table annotation:element="items">
  <tr annotation:element="item">
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>{name}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
}}}
In some systems, the sections are then manipulated within program code; in others, the template structure indicates sections which are to be repeated, omitted, and so on, and the templating system then merges the template with some data structure provided by the program. Generally, the reason for annotating templates in this way (particularly through the use of attributes) is to better support the editing of such templates in XML-based tools which might otherwise complain about or damage template information if it were not included carefully in documents.

 * ClearSilver - uses special elements/tags
 * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-templates//|HTMLTemplate]] - special attributes denote HTML elements that can be manipulated as Python objects ('''As of 2013-12-05, this project is no longer under active development.''')
 * JonsPythonModules - uses special comment-like markers
 * [[http://www.plope.com/software/meld3/|meld3]] and [[http://www.entrian.com/PyMeld|PyMeld]] are very similar

 * [[http://opensource.perlig.de/tdi/|TDI]] - Manipulate tagged HTML/XML elements with normal Python code. Fast.

In other systems, the annotations are actually evaluated in order to produce repeated sections, to omit or include sections, and so on:

 * [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/|Genshi]] - Template engine inspired by Kid, supports both [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/xml-templates.html|XML]] and [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/text-templates.html|plain-text]] templates

 * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/cherrypy/|CherryTemplate]] - is a Pythonic HTTP toolkit.

== HTML Shorthand Processors ==
The libraries in this section implement simpler markup languages that can be automatically converted to HTML. This lets you avoid having to write HTML by hand.

 * [[http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/|AsciiDoc]]
 * [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown|Markdown]]
 * PyTextile
 * [[reStructuredText]]
 * [[http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/|txt2tags]]
 * [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PottyMouth/2.2.1|PottyMouth]] (for untrusted text input)
 * [[http://code.google.com/p/python-creole/|Creole]] (creole to html and html to creole)

== Template engines implemented as Internal DSL's ==
These engines are implemented as an internal DSL, that is, they don't process text into markup, rather they represent the final document as actual Python code and data structures. See: [[http://bitbucket.org/tavisrudd/throw-out-your-templates/src/tip/throw_out_your_templates.py|An overview of the benefits of this internal DSL approach vs external template languages]]

 * [[http://docs.g-vo.org/meetstan.html|Stan]]

 * [[http://dirty.googlecode.com/|Dirty]]

== HTML Generation Packages ==
'''Many of these links are dead. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable might want to fix or prune them.'''

These packages are not really templating systems in that they do not typically employ a template document as such to define the form of the output they produce, but they can be useful in applications where it is more convenient to programmatically generate output.

 * [[http://www.webelements.in/|WebElements]] allows creating html documents using python objects that represent their DOM equivalents, inspired by QT.
 * [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/|Genshi]] The genshi.builder module provides [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/builder.html|simple markup generation]]
 * [[https://packages.debian.org/sid/python-htmlgen|HTMLgen]] A old-school module first written for Python 1.x. Debian's package maintainers' patches bring it into the twenty-first century with Python 2.7 compatibility. [[https://github.com/dbohdan/HTMLgen|Mirrored]] on GitHub.
 * [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914004317/http://pylonshq.com/WebHelpers/module-webhelpers.htmlgen.html|webhelpers.htmlgen]] Kind of like HTMLGen, only much simpler. Like stan, only not.
 * [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html|html]] Provides a simple syntax to generate HTML, XHTML and XML.
 * [[http://code.activestate.com/recipes/366000/|HTMLTags]]
 * [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202041542/http://dustman.net/andy/python/HyperText/|HyperText]]
 * [[http://markup.sourceforge.net/|markup]] A light-weight and flexible HTML/XML generator
 * [[http://www.livinglogic.de/Python/xist/|XIST]]
 * [[http://pyhtmloo.sourceforge.net/|pyhtmloo]] pyhtmloo is a library that allows python developers to use HTML code like any other python objects.
 * [[http://www.yattag.org/|Yattag]] Provides a readable way to write HTML or XML within Python using indented blocks instead of <tag>...</tag> constructs.

== Static Website Generators ==
Static website generators are more than templating engines in that they create ''the whole site structure'', not just individual files. While templating is an important part of their function, determining the site structure and ''incorporating structural information'' in the output (for example to automatically generate navigational elements) is what really makes a static website generator a useful tool.

See StaticSiteGenerator for the list.

== Java Templating Engines ==
The following templating engines are accessible or usable via Jython:

 * [[http://freemarker.org/index.html|FreeMarker]] (with Jython data binding)
 * [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jsp-138432.html|Java Server Pages, JSP]]
 * [[http://velocity.apache.org/|Velocity]]
 * [[http://www.webmacro.org/|WebMacro]]

== CPython-accessible C Templating Engines ==
 * ClearSilver - HTML generation, uses HDF as input format
