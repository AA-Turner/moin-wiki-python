= Google Python Sprint 2007 =

  * When: August 22-25, probably ~ 9.30 am - 5pm PT
  * Where: Mountain View Google Campus - University Theater Bldg 40
  * Who: Neal Norwitz, Talin, Alex Martelli, Collin Winter, Guido van Rossum, and ''you?''
  * What: Py3k primarily

We are sprinting Aug 22-25, 2007 at Google's Mountain View, California headquarters (MTV).  Google's Open Source Program Office is doing much of the internal coordination with Jeremy Hylton and Neal Norwitz handling more of the technical side.  We hope many Googlers and non-Googlers will participate.

'''Goals and Suggested Sprint Areas'''

Some suggestions:
  * Python 3000 (for tasks and status, see ["Python3000"])
  * [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 2.5 bug fixing]
  * Cleanup for 2.6
  * New features for 2.6 (PEP may be required)
     * Merging in memory tracking work from bcannon-sandboxing branch 
  * more big-memory tests for 2.5+ (dicts, unicode, array, struct)
  * Cleaning and unification of package documentation
  * Implement Signature objects (Brett Cannon)
  * Add your ideas here

'''Housing - MTV'''

You can book a room at The Residence Inn Palo Alto/Mountain View; ask for Google's corporate rate.  If you're looking to save funds, you might consider booking a penthouse room at the property and doubling up with another attendee.

Guests are welcome to arrive any time after 9:30 AM.

(Non-Googlers: please go to the Building 40 reception and let the receptionist know you are here for the Python Sprint and you will receive a badge.)

'''Come Prepared!'''

Please come prepared so we won't have to waste time helping everybody with their setup.  Bring a laptop (preferably running Linux or OSX; we have limited svn setup experience for other systems, esp. Windows).  Make sure svn is installed: http://subversion.tigris.org/ -- Check [http://prolificprogrammer.com/~hdiwan/blog/2006/08/02/home_subversion_repository_1.html Hasans Blog Entry on subversion ] for help with other systems.

For Python 2.5/2.6, check out the head branch; see http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn (use the instructions for anonymous checkout unless you already have developer privileges).

For py3k, check out the "py3k-struni" branch.  Also read PEPs 3000-3999.

In either case, make sure you have at least built and tested it once so you are familiar with the process.  It's something like "./configure; make; make test" in the appropriate directory.  (For Py3k, 25 or so tests typically fail -- a goal of the sprint will be to fix these.)

'''Questions'''

Are you guys on IRC, Google Talk, or something like that?  Answer: no IRC AFAIK; some individuals can be IM'ed in gmail chat, e.g. gvanrossum@gmail.com.

No other locations?  Last time there was an NYC location and had he known about it Fitz would have probably put together a Chicago location...  -- SkipMontanaro
