== Goals and Suggested Sprint Areas ==

The primary focus will be on getting new features into 3.0 before the first alpha.  We hope to have a solid, stable and reasonably complete 3.0a1.  You can make this happen and have fun doing it!  Come join us.

Some suggestions:
  * Python 3000 (for tasks and status, see ["Python3000"])
  * Cleanup for 2.6/3.0 transition
  * Documentation for the transition
  * Add fixers to the 2to3 tool
  * Add your ideas here

== Food ==

We'll be providing lunch and dinner to our attendees and breakfast will be available from the micro-kitchens.  Our guests will dine with us in our cafes for their meals.

== Housing - MTV ==

You can book a room at The Residence Inn Palo Alto/Mountain View; ask for Google's corporate rate.  If you're looking to save funds, you might consider booking a penthouse room at the property and doubling up with another attendee.

== Come Prepared! ==

Please come prepared so we won't have to waste time helping everybody with their setup.  Bring a laptop (preferably running Linux or OSX; we have limited svn setup experience for other systems, esp. Windows).  Make sure svn is installed: http://subversion.tigris.org/ -- Check [http://prolificprogrammer.com/~hdiwan/blog/2006/08/02/home_subversion_repository_1.html Hasans Blog Entry on subversion ] for help with other systems.

For Python 2.6, check out the head branch; see http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn (use the instructions for anonymous checkout unless you already have developer privileges).

For py3k, check out the "py3k" branch.  Also read PEPs 3000-3999.

In either case, make sure you have at least built and tested it once so you are familiar with the process.  It's something like "./configure; make; make test" in the appropriate directory.  (For Py3k, half a dozen tests typically fail -- a goal of the sprint will be to fix these.)

=== Questions ===

Are you guys on IRC, Google Talk, or something like that?  Answer: no IRC AFAIK; some individuals can be IM'ed in gmail chat, e.g. gvanrossum@gmail.com, nnorwitz@gmail.com.

Various [http://freenode.net/ Freenode IRC] channels appear to be unused: #py3k, #pysprint, #sprynt, etc.. I could register one if there was interest, but it's not strictly required. --pfein on irc://irc.freenode.net

I suspect #python-dev would be sufficient. -- SkipMontanaro
