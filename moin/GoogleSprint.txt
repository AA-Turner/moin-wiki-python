'''Last year's Sprint Info'''

Given the recent spate of successful [:SprintIntroduction: sprints], Google decided it would be a good idea to host a sprint.  We've been talking about it since PyCon.  Jeremy finally got the ball rolling.  

We are sprinting Aug 21-24, 2006.  There are 2 locations:  Google's New York City office (NYC), and Google's Mountain View, California office (MTV).  Google's Open Source Program Office is doing much of the internal coordination with Jeremy Hylton and Neal Norwitz handling more of the technical side.  We hope many Googlers and non-Googlers will participate.

'''Goals and Suggested Sprint Areas'''

Some suggestions:
  * Python 3000 (for tasks and status, see GoogleSprintPy3k)
  * [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 2.5 bug fixing]
  * Cleanup for 2.6
  * New features for 2.6 (PEP may be required)
     * Merging in memory tracking work from bcannon-sandboxing branch 
  * more big-memory tests for 2.5+ (dicts, unicode, array, struct)
  * Cleaning and unification of package documentation
  * Implement Signature objects (Brett Cannon)
  * Add your ideas here

'''Food'''

We'll be providing lunch and dinner to our attendees and breakfast will be available from the microkitchens.  Our guests will dine with us in our cafes for their meals.

'''Housing - MTV'''

You can book a room at The Residence Inn Palo Alto/Mountain View; ask for Google's corporate rate.  If you're looking to save funds, you might consider booking a penthouse room at the property and doubling up with another attendee.

'''Housing - NYC'''

Google's preferred hotels are The Muse Hotel (http://www.themusehotel.com) and The Paramount Hotel (http://www.ianschragerhotels.com/home_search.html?paramount); ask for the Google corporate rate when booking. 

Both are located within walking distance of the NYC office.  

'''Security - NYC'''

Please make sure to bring photo identification with you when you visit the office.  You will need it to clear building security.  Please plan to also sign in at Google reception upon arrival.

All non-Googler Sprint attendees for NYC listed on the wiki as of 1 PM Pacific on 8/17/06 have been pre-registered with building security.  If you have added yourself to the wiki after this time, please email Leslie Hawthorn (lh@google.com) so she can add you to the visitors list.

'''Come Prepared!'''

Please come prepared so we won't have to waste time helping everybody with their setup.  Bring a laptop (preferably running Linux or OSX; we have limited svn setup experience for other systems, esp. Windows).  Make sure svn is installed: http://subversion.tigris.org/ -- Check [http://prolificprogrammer.com/~hdiwan/blog/2006/08/02/home_subversion_repository_1.html Hasans Blog Entry on subversion ] for help with other systems.

For Python 2.5/2.6, check out the head branch; see http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn (use the instructions for anonymous checkout unless you already have developer privileges).

For py3k, check out the "p3yk" (sic -- the typo is historic and won't be fixed any time soon) branch.  Also read PEPs 3000-3999.

In either case, make sure you have at least built and tested it once so you are familiar with the process.  It's something like "./configure; make; make test" in the appropriate directory.  (For Py3k, 5 or so tests typically fail -- a goal of the sprint will be to fix these.)

'''Questions'''

Are you guys on IRC, Google Talk, or something like that?  Answer: no IRC AFAIK; some individuals can be IM'ed in gmail chat, e.g. gvanrossum@gmail.com.
