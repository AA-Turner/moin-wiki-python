Given the recent spate of successful sprints, Google decided it would be a good idea to host a sprint.  We've been talking about it since PyCon.  Jeremy finally got the ball rolling.  

We plan to hold the sprint Aug 21-24, 2006.  This date should be after 2.5 is released (early August).  There will be 2 locations:  Google's New York City office (NYC), and Google's Mountain View, California office (MTV).  Google's Open Source Program Office is doing much of the internal coordination with Jeremy Hylton and Neal Norwitz handling more of the technical side.  We hope many Googlers and non-Googlers will participate.  Please add your name below if you are interested.

The goals of the sprint have not yet been defined.  We should try to fix any serious 2.5 bugs as well as cleanup the code to prepare for 2.6.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Adding a possible goal: Those who have seen the [http://mrtopf.tv/vlog/ Alan Kay keynote] at [www.europython.org EuroPython 2006 @ CERN] have heard his call for Python help to the [http://laptop.org/ OLPC project].  I think this sprint could form a starting point. Those help would also lead to a very big improvement for Browser based computing, in that way giving back to the sprint sponsor.
