There are several [http://esw.w3.org/topic/RDF RDF] processing libraries for Python:

 * rdfLib - you can construct a triple store, load it from an RDF file, and search through it - easy to install, no dependencies that I know of, small and easy, haven't been able to figure out how to do much with it.
 * SemanticWebApplicationPlatform - http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ - has a lot of stuff, feels like a big lump of code with little differentiation - looks great, but, what is it?
   * It's a big lump of code. :)  It's the W3C-semweb-hacker's playground.
 * 4RDF - part of ["4Suite"] - will progressively get merged into rdflib:  http://rdflib.net/4rdf_rdflib_migration/
 * RedlandRdf - http://librdf.org/docs/python.html - 
   * Redland is a python [and other-lang] wrapper around a C library.
   * The interface is not as pythonic as RdfLib, but "feels" about the same.
   * Redland uses Raptor for parsing/serialization; Raptor supports NTriples, RDF/XML, Turtle, RSS, Atom.
 * ["Rx4RDF"] - http://rx4rdf.liminalzone.org - is an application stack for building RDF-based applications and web sites. It uses either 4Suite, RdfLib or RedlandRdf as the RDF store and layers on the following:
     * RxPath lets you query, transform and update RDF using familar XML technologies like XPath, XSLT and XUpdate. 
     * Raccoon is a simple application server that uses an RDF model for its data store, roughly analogous to RDF as [http://cocoon.apache.org Apache Cocoon] is to XML. 
     * Rhizome is a content management and delivery system that runs on Raccoon that treates everything (structure and content) as RDF and lets you edit the RDF in a Wiki-like fashion.
