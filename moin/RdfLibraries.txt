There are several RDF processing libraries for Python:

 * RdfLib - you can construct a triple store, load it from an RDF file, and search through it - easy to install, no dependencies that I know of, small and easy, haven't been able to figure out how to do much with it
 * RedFoot - http://redfoot.net/ - don't know much about, seems to be rather big, bulky, capable, and complicated
 * SemanticWebApplicationPlatform - http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ - has a lot of stuff, feels like a big lump of code with little differentiation - looks great, but, what is it?
 * ["4RDF"] - part of ["4Suite"] - haven't looked into
 * RedlandRdf - http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/python.html - Don't know much about this one either
