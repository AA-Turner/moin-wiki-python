There are several RDF processing libraries for Python:

 * RdfLib - you can construct a triple store, load it from an RDF file, and search through it - easy to install, no dependencies that I know of, small and easy, haven't been able to figure out how to do much with it.
 * SemanticWebApplicationPlatform - http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ - has a lot of stuff, feels like a big lump of code with little differentiation - looks great, but, what is it?
   * It's a big lump of code. :)  It's the W3C-semweb-hacker's playground.
 * ["4RDF"] - part of ["4Suite"] - haven't looked into
 * RedlandRdf - http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/python.html - Don't know much about this one either
   * Redland is a python [and other-lang] wrapper around a C library.
   * The interface is not as pythonic as RdfLib, but "feels" about the same.
   * Redland uses Raptor for parsing/serialization; Raptor supports NTriples, RDF/XML, Turtle.
