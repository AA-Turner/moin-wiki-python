= RDF Libraries for Python =

There are several [[http://esw.w3.org/topic/RDF|RDF]] processing libraries for Python, however many seem abandoned. [[https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/|RdfLib]] is the primary library that is still maintained. 

Active:

 * [[https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/|RdfLib]] (see [[RdfLib]]) - Has utilities for constructing triplestores, loading and parsing rdf, searching, and other functions.
   * Actively maintained as of late 2023
   * Easily installed with pip, pure python implementation
 * [[https://sparqlwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|SparqlWrapper]] is provided by RDFLib and provides utilities for querying a sparql endpoint (such as an RDF4J triplestore) from Python and parsing output
  * Latest release (as of Oct. 2023) in 2022

Abandoned: 
 * [[http://oort.to/overview.html|Oort]] is a toolkit using rdflib, Paste and Genshi, focusing on Web views of RDF graphs.
   * [[https://pypi.org/project/Oort/|Last release]] was 0.4 in 2007
 * RedlandRdf - http://librdf.org/docs/python.html - 
   * Redland is a python [and other-lang] wrapper around a C library.
   * The interface is not as pythonic as rdflib, but "feels" about the same.
   * Redland uses Raptor for parsing/serialization; Raptor supports NTriples, RDF/XML, Turtle, RSS, Atom.
   * [[https://librdf.org/NEWS.html|Latest release]] around 2014
 * [[Rx4RDF]] - http://rx4rdf.liminalzone.org - is an application stack for building RDF-based applications and web sites. It uses either 4Suite, rdflib or RedlandRdf as the RDF store and layers on the following:
     * RxPath lets you query, transform and update RDF using familar XML technologies like XPath, XSLT and XUpdate. 
     * Raccoon is a simple application server that uses an RDF model for its data store, roughly analogous to RDF as [[http://cocoon.apache.org|Apache Cocoon]] is to XML. 
     * Rhizome is a content management and delivery system that runs on Raccoon that treates everything (structure and content) as RDF and lets you edit the RDF in a Wiki-like fashion.
     * [[https://pypi.org/project/rx4rdf/#history|Latest release]] around 2004
 * SemanticWebApplicationPlatform - http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ - has a lot of stuff, feels like a big lump of code with little differentiation - looks great, but, what is it?
   * It's a big lump of code. :)  It's the W3C-semweb-hacker's playground.
   * It has migrated to [[https://github.com/linkeddata/swap|github]], but is described as historic
   * [[https://github.com/linkeddata/swap/tags|Last formal release]] in 2007, but updated in 2022
   * Primary contributor is Tim Berners-Lee
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/sqltriples|sqltriples]] is a triple store implementation which uses relational databases to offer transactional storage and enhanced querying.
   * [[https://pypi.org/project/sqltriples/#history|Latest release]] in 2007
