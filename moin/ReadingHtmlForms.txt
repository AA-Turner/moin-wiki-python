A friend of mine recently asked, "Is there anything in Python that can read forms?

He's got perl code that looks like this:

{{{
	my $form = HTML::Form->parse($writeFormPage, $res->base());
	defined($form) or return "Can't even get wiki edit form at $URL";
    if ($form->find_input('savetext')) {
	$form->value('savetext',$pagetext);
    }
	my $req = $form->click('button_save');
	my $res = $ua->request($req);
}}}

I thought, "{{{cgi}}} module," but realized it's for writing pages, not reading them. Then I thought {{{urllib}}}, but didn't see anything very promising over there, either.

Does anyone know of Python code or a Python module that will help you read out forms, and create responses to them?

[[http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html#forms|lxml.html]] has pretty sophisticated HTML form support.

Look at: 

 * Mechanize: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ (which is based on a Perl module)
 * Webunit: http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/webunit/
