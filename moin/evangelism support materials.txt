aptly observed that these are 
"needed:                                                                                                               
 * Slides / notes for presentation overviewing the PSF (I have some very simple slides I can provide as a start to whoever takes this on, and can help but can't lead this)
 * Course materials for an "evangelism training seminar"                       
 * Review of PSF web pages to make them more evangelist-friendly               
 * Possibly, printable handouts and other supplementary materials".

This [http://python.org/moin Wiki] page is where we'll start to flesh out Stephan's outline.  Note, for example, AMK's 
[http://www.amk.ca/talks/python-dev/ slides for a talk on the Python development process].

Isn't someone else keeping a list of killer apps?  Anyway,

AMK observes that, "It might be worth creating a customized version of the S5 slide                 
stylesheets so that PSF presentations can have a consistent look."

Also available, on request:  both Stephan
(through the psf-volunteers list (hyperlink?))
and evangelism support materials
czar [http://python.org/moin/CameronLaird Cameron Laird] maintain a list of volunteers at
least occasionally available to speak on Python, sorted by locale (DC, Seattle,
Texas, Central America, and so on).

Other highlights I want to elaborate:  Pythonology;
language comparisons; presentation tips; PBF ...; 
Greg's eShop story; ...
