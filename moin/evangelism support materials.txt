[http://www.python.org/psf PSF] chairman [:StephanDeibel: Stephan Deibel] aptly observed that these are "needed:                                                                                                               
 * Slides / notes for presentation overviewing the PSF (I have some very simple slides I can provide as a start to whoever takes this on, and can help but can't lead this)
 * Course materials for an 'evangelism training seminar'                       
 * Review of PSF web pages to make them more evangelist-friendly               
 * Possibly, printable handouts and other supplementary materials".  Some notes on this are on the PsfMaterials page.

This [http://python.org/moin/ Wiki] page is where we'll start to flesh out Stephan's outline.  Note, for example, AMK's 
[http://www.amk.ca/talks/python-dev/ slides for a talk on the Python development process].

AMK observes that, "It might be worth creating a customized version of the S5 slide stylesheets so that PSF presentations can have a consistent look."

Also available, on request:  both Stephan
(through the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-volunteers psf-volunteers] list)
and evangelism support materials
czar [http://python.org/moin/CameronLaird Cameron Laird] maintain a list of volunteers at
