aptly observed that these are 
"needed:                                                                                                               
 * Slides / notes for presentation overviewing the PSF (I have some very simple slides I can provide as a start to whoever takes this on, and can help but can't lead this)
 * Course materials for an "evangelism training seminar"                       
 * Review of PSF web pages to make them more evangelist-friendly               
 * Possibly, printable handouts and other supplementary materials".
