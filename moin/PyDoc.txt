pydoc is a command similar to Perl's perldoc. You run it on the command line, passing it the name of a module it's able to find, and it shows you something similar to a manpage, created from the docstrings in said module.

Within the python interpreter, when you type "help(something)", that interactive manpage-like help is supplied by pydoc.
