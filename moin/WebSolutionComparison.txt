Real-world comparisons of Python web solutions.
=== Introduction ===

'''This page is not yet finished.'''

I've been a Python programmer for quite some time -- since the 1.5.2 days.  I learned early on how easy it is to create web sites in Python, and I've done several.

In fact, I realized this week that I have built non-trivial web sites using at least 4 of the popular web architecture solutions.  Arrogantly, I thought that my experiences and personal evaluations of these architectures might be useful to other programmers faced with the daunting list of possibilities.

I will address the architectures in the order in which I used them.  I've been programming for a long time, and in that time I've learned a few things about what kinds of techniques make for workable and maintable programs.  In web programming, in particular, I've learned that it is important to separate processing from presentation: the bulk of the HTML text should not be deeply embedded in the programming code that creates the page.  You'll see that theme repeated in my comments.

Please note that these are strictly '''my personal opinions'''.

I welcome your comments, disagreements, and your own experiences.  That's the fun of a wiki.
