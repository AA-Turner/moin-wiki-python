I started to write computer programs using 
MS-DOS Quick``Basic. Then I have learned to 
program in APL, SQL, C, C++, MS Visual Basic 
and MS Visual C++ and started to write 
DHTML pages using Java``Script. 

If you are interested in playing against or 
programming your first own Java``Script engine 
for the five-in-a-row game check out my online 
page:

My first Python scripts are dated 2003.
 
News: 

(2005-02-07) uploaded my version of:
      http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/Console.py
which is part of the readline module. Now the (extended) 
Console() class supports ANSI escape sequences of the 
form ESC[#m and ESC[#,#m , so it is possible to set any 
colors for text and background via escape sequences.
