I started to write computer programs using 
MS-DOS Quick``Basic. Then I have learned to 
program in APL, SQL, C, C++, MS Visual Basic 
and MS Visual C++ and started to write 
DHTML pages using Java``Script. 

If you are interested in playing against or 
programming your first own Java``Script engine 
for the five-in-a-row game check out my online

My first Python scripts are dated 2003. 
2005-02-07: see some of my Python programming on:
      http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/Console.py
part of the readline module. 
The (extended) Console() class supports ANSI escape
sequences of the form ESC[#m and ESC[#,#m ,
so it is possible to set any colors for text and
background via escape sequences.
