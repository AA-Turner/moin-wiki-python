Started to write computer programs using 
Algol 60 and Fortran running on a mainframe
computer. 

Learned to 
program in APL, MS-DOS Quick``Basic , MySQL, 
PHP, C, C++, MS Visual Basic 
and MS Visual C++ and to write 
DHTML pages using Java``Script. 

If you are interested in playing against or 
programming your first own Java``Script engine 
for the five-in-a-row game check out my online 
page:

My first own Python scripts are dated 2003.

# 2005-10-11 : uploaded the '''How``To_Access``Raw``Sectors``Of``Physical``Drives'''.py
to http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/HowTo_AccessRawSectorsOfPhysicalDrives.py .
For more details on this subject check out the thread

(MFT, boot sector, etc.) in MS Windows 
posted to comp.lang.python 2005-10-10. 

# 2005-04-09 : posted to comp.lang.python a Python script 
(pyMBM.py) querying the shared memory area exposed by the 
freeware MBM 5 utility 
(available from http://mbm.livewiredev.com/)
for tracking motherboard sensory information as 
temperatures, fan speeds and voltages. 

# 2005-02-07 : uploaded my own version of Console.py to
http://people.freenet.de/AiTI-IT/Python/Console.py
Console.py is part of the readline module and is used by 
e.g. IPython. In my version the (extended) Console() 
class supports any ANSI escape sequences of the form 
ESC[#m and ESC[#,#m , making it possible to set any 
by console supported text and background colors.
