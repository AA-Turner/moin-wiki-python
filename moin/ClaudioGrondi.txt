I started to write computer programs using 
MS-DOS QuickBasic. Then I have learned to 
program in APL, SQL, C, C++, MS Visual Basic 
and MS Visual C++ and started to write 
DHTML pages using JavaScript. 

If you are interested in playing against or 
programming your first own JavaScript engine 
for the five-in-a-row game check out my online

My first Python scripts are dated 2003.
