This page lists features that GvR has mentioned as goals for Python 3.0.
This page has been consolidated into PEP 3000; the PEP is more up-to-date
and is actively maintained. [[#e 5]]

(Another list is at PythonThreeDotOh, but it incorporates items that GvR has never talked about.)

== Core Language Changes ==

 * Remove distinction between `int` and `long` types. [[#d 4]]
 * Make all strings unicode [[#d 4]], and have a separate `bytes` [[#b 2]] type.
 * Replace all old-style classes. [[#d 4]]
 * Make the `exec` statement a function (again.) [[#a 1]]
 * Make the `print` statement a function. (`write(x,y,z), writeln(x,y,z)`) [[#a 1]]
 * Add a mechanism so that multiple exceptions can be caught using `except E1, E2, E3:`.  For instance: {{{
#!python
except E1, E2, E3 as err:  # Store error variable
   ...
}}} (Added by GvR, suggested by Bram Cohen.)
 * Add a `with` statement: {{{
#!python
with self:
    .foo = [1, 2, 3]
    .bar(4, .foo)
}}}

 * Remove {{{`x`}}}. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `repr(x)`.
   * Reason: backticks are hard to read in many fonts and can be mangled by typesetting software.
 * Remove the `<>` operator.
   * Instead: use `!=`.
 * Remove the `lambda` statement. [[#a 1]] [[#d 4]]
   * Instead: use a local function.
   * Reason: `lambda` supports only one statement.
 * Remove support for string exceptions. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use a class.
 * Perhaps have optional declarations for static typing.
   * One suggestion is to [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-February/042795.html use an "as" keyword for this] and for adaptation ([http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0246.html PEP 246]): {{{
#!python
# "x as y" means: adapt x to the y protocol

def foo (a as int, b as float) as float:
    a2 = a as float  # Same as: adapt(a, float)
    ...
}}}

 * Make list comprehensions equivalent to passing a generator expression to `list()`.
   * Reason: they are essentially the same and it would remove edge-case differences between them.
 * Make `as` a true keyword. [[#g 7]]
 * Make `True` and `False` keywords. [[#f 6]]
   * Reason: make assignment to them impossible.
 * Make true division default.
 * Remove `__cmp__` (and possibly `cmp()`). [[#h 8]]
   * Reason: [TOOWTDI] and rich comparisons are another way.
 * Raise an exception when comparing two heterogeneous types with operators other than `==` and `!=`.
   * Reason: such comparisons do not make sense, and are especially confusing to new users of Python.
 * Have types compare as unequal when they are heterogeneous. [[#i 9]]
   * Reason: equality does not make sense between heterogeneous types.
 * Require that all exceptions inherit a common base classs. [[#j 10]]
   * Reason: forces the use of classes as objects raised by exceptions and simplifies the implementation.


== Built-In Changes ==

 * Have `range()`, `zip()`, `dict.keys()`, `dict.items()`, and `dict.values()` return iterators.
 * Move `compile()`, `intern()` and `id()` to the `sys` module. [[#a 1]]
 * Change `max()` and `min()` to consume iterators.
 * Remove `coerce()` as it is obsolete. [[#a 1]]
 * Remove `dict.iteritems()`, `dict.iterkeys()`, and `dict.itervalues()`.
   * Instead: use `dict.items()`, `dict.keys()`, and `dict.values()` respectively.
 * Remove `apply()`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `f(*args, **kw)`.
 * Remove `xrange()`. [[#a 1]] [[#d 4]]
   * Instead: use `range()`.
 * Remove `map()` and `filter()`.  [[#a 1]] [[#d 4]]
   * Instead: use list comprehensions.
 * Remove `reduce()`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use a loop.
 * Remove `callable()`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: catch the exception.
 * Remove `buffer()`. [[#a 1]] [[#b 2]]
   * Instead: use new `bytes` type. 
 * Remove `raw_input()`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `sys.stdin.readline()`.
 * Remove `input()`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `eval(sys.stdin.readline())`.
 * Remove `execfile()` and `reload()`.  [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `exec()`.


== Standard Library Changes ==

 * Remove `string` module. [[#c 4]]
   * Instead: use string methods.
 * Remove other deprecated modules. [[#c 3]]
 * Remove `sys.exc_type`. [[#a 1]]
   * Instead: use `sys.exc_info`.
   * Reason: it is not thread safe.
 * Reorganize standard library to have more package structure.
   * Reason: there are too many modules to keep a flat hierarchy.


== Unresolved Issues ==

 * `L += x` and `L.extend(x)` are equivalent.
 * Can the parameter order of the `insert` method be changed so the the index parameter is optional and `list.append` may be removed?
 * Should the `raise x, y` syntax be removed as to favor `raise x(y)`?
 * Are `repr()` and `str()` both needed? [[#a 1]]
 * Should `globals()`, `locals()` and `vars()` be removed? [[#a 1]]
 * Should there be a keyword for allowing the shadowing of built-ins?
 * Should injecting into another module's global namespace be prevented?
