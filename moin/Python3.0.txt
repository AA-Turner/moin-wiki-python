This page lists features that GvR has mentioned as goals for Python 3.0.

(Another list is at PythonThreeDotOh, but it incorporates items that GvR has never talked about.)

 * Reduce feature duplication:
   * string module vs. string methods
   * xrange() vs range()
   * int vs. long
   * 8 bit vs. Unicode strings
   * map/filter/reduce vs. list comprehensions
   * lambda vs. def
 * Library reorganization
 * Return iterators instead of lists
   * d.keys(), .values(), .items()
   * range(), zip(), map(), filter()
 * Consume iterators
   * min(), max()
 * Optional static typing?
 * Support only new-style classes; classic classes will be gone.
 * Remove string exceptions, `x` for repr(x), sys.exc_type, coerce(), other deprecated stuff
 * print as a function -- write(x,y,z), writeln(x,y,z)

See the "Python Regrets" talk and other recent presentations by Guido.

== Other Ideas from the BDFL ==

 * "I want to reserve the leading dot for attribute assignment to a special object specified by a 'with' statement."

== Rearrangements ==

intern(), id(): put in sys

xrange(): make range() return an iterator

buffer(): must die (use bytes, PEP 296)

raw_input(): use sys.stdin.readline()

input(): use eval(sys.stdin.readline())

callable(): just call it, already

execfile(), reload(): use exec()

compile(): put in sys

exec as a statement is not worth it -- make it a function
