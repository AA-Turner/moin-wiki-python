BayPiggies is taking the lead in making a bid for PyCon2010 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The following are the questions asked by Python.org of bidders to host PyCon.

Staff and volunteers who have answers are encouraged to put the information here. This is not the official bid, so don't worry about formatting, but do try to be accurate. It helps to give the source of your information as a link. 

The requirements for future PyCon bids will be different than years past in that we won't be asking local groups to actually begin negotiations with venues.

''Right. We can identify candidates, but we won't be negotiating the contract.''

Instead, we're looking for a somewhat less formal proposal telling us why PyCon should be held in your local area:
 * Tell us, briefly, what's good and what's great about the city/region/state that would make it a good place to host PyCon.

''BayPiggies, Silicon Valley, Guido, Google...''

Tell us the pros and cons about the local area:

''Moscone, Santa Clara Convention Center, San Jose Convention Center, various hotels''
