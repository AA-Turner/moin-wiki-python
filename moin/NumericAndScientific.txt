Model building tools use symbolic expression and hierarchical specification classes to ease the development and analysis of complex models. This includes automated compilation of symbolic representations of models into fast numerical code using enhanced legacy Fortran and C integrators for both stiff and non-stiff systems.

  * [[https://launchpad.net/escript-finley|escript]] - https://launchpad.net/escript-finley -- escript is a Python module to define and solve coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs).

The current version uses the FEM solver library finley but the design is open and other libraries can be used. escript is parallelized for OpenMP and MPI. It is compatible with  NumPy and VTK for visualization.

PyIMSL offers a quality Python interface to the largest collection of portable statistical and analytical algorithms available for Python. Developers can use Python, PyIMSL and the IMSL C Library for rapid prototyping. They can then directly deploy the Python application into production or if they choose to rewrite the application in C/C++ use the same math and stats algorithms in both development environments. [[http://www.vni.com/campaigns/pyimslstudioeval|PyIMSL Studio]] is a packaged, supported and documented development environment designed for deploying mathematics and statistics prototype models into production applications. PyIMSL Studio includes the Python language distribution and contains both open source and proprietary components that create a fully supported and documented platform for analytic prototyping and production development. PyIMSL Studio is available for download at no charge for non-commercial use or for commercial evaluation.
