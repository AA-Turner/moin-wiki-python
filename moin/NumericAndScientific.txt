= Numeric and Scientific =

  * ["PyGSL"] - http://pygsl.sourceforge.net/ -- This project provides a python interface for the GNU scientific library (gsl).

  * ["NumPy"] - http://numpy.scipy.org/ -- Numerical Python adds a fast, compact, multidimensional array facility to Python.  NumPy is the successor to both Numeric and Numarray.

  * ["Numeric"] - http://www.numpy.org/ -- Numerical Python adds a fast, compact, multidimensional array language facility to Python. (Note: superseded by NumPy)

  * NumArray - http://stsdas.stsci.edu/numarray/index.html -- Numarray is a reimplementation of Numeric which adds the ability to efficiently manipulate large numeric arrays in ways similar to Matlab and IDL.  (Note: superseded by NumPy)

  * SciPy - http://www.scipy.org/ (older info still on http://old.scipy.org) SciPy is an open source library of scientific tools for Python. SciPy supplements the popular NumPy module, gathering a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package.  SciPy includes modules for  linear algebra, optimization, integration, special functions, signal and image processing, statistics, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers, and others.

  * !SymPy - http://code.google.com/p/sympy/ !SymPy is a symbolic manipulation package, written in pure Python. Its aim is to become a full featured CAS in Python, while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

  * ScientificPython - http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/ -- ScientificPython is a collection of Python modules that are useful for scientific computing. In this collection you will find modules that cover basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector and tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear) interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple line plots and 3D wireframe models. There are also interfaces to the netCDF library (portable structured binary files), to MPI (Message Passing Interface, message-based parallel programming), and to BSPlib (Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming). 

  * ["PyACTS"]- http://www.pyacts.org -- PyACTS is a collection of Python Modules that are very useful to Parallel Computing in a High Performance Computing environment. This packages incorporates several modules like PyBLACS (allows communication data for Linear Algebra), PyPBLAS (distributed Matrix Operations) and PyScaLAPACK (solve linear systems and get the eigenvalue problems). These libraries are part of PyACTS project that provide interfaces to the ACTS Collection. Also is provided a parrallel interpreter for using this package that implements message-based parallel programming using MPI.

  * ["PyDSTool"] - http://pydstool.sourceforge.net -- PyDSTool is an integrated simulation, modeling and analysis package for dynamical systems (including ODEs, DAEs, maps, and hybrid systems) and scientific data. Building on SciPy classes, the package also supports symbolic expression processing, bifurcation analysis, and enhanced arrays for "index-free" and highly contextualized scientific data manipulation. Model building tools use symbolic expression and hierarchical specification classes to ease the development and analysis of complex models. This includes automated compilation of symbolic representations of models into fast numerical code using enhanced legacy Fortran and C integrators for both stiff and non-stiff systems.

  * ["escript"] - https://shake200.esscc.uq.edu.au/twiki/bin/view/ESSCC/EsysUser -- escript is a python module to define and solve coupled, non-linear, time-dependend partial differential equations (PDEs). The user has to implement high-level time intergration schemes and iteration schemes to reduce the problem to the solution of steady, linear systems of PDEs which are solved by a suitable PDE solver library. The current version uses the FEM solver library finley but the design is open and other libraries can be used. escript is parallelized for OpenMP (MPI is under construction). It is compatible with NumArray and uses VTK for visualization.

 * GmPy (http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/) - GNU Multiple Precision library wrapping
 * ["mpmath"] - http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/ - mpmath is a pure Python library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic, with support for complex numbers. Implements all the transcendental functions from Python's math and cmath modules and a few others.
