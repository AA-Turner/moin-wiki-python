= Numeric and Scientific =

  * ["NumPy"] - http://numeric.scipy.org/ -- Numerical Python adds a fast, compact, multidimensional array facility to Python.  NumPy is the successor to both Numeric and Numarray.

  * ["Numeric"] - http://www.numpy.org/ -- Numerical Python adds a fast, compact, multidimensional array language facility to Python. (Note: superseded by NumPy)

  * NumArray - http://stsdas.stsci.edu/numarray/index.html -- Numarray is a reimplementation of Numeric which adds the ability to efficiently manipulate large numeric arrays in ways similar to Matlab and IDL.  (Note: superseded by NumPy)

  * SciPy - http://www.scipy.org/ (older info still on http://old.scipy.org) SciPy is an open source library of scientific tools for Python. SciPy supplements the popular NumPy module, gathering a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package.  SciPy includes modules for  linear algebra, optimization, integration, special functions, signal and image processing, statistics, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers, and others.

  * ScientificPython - http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/ -- ScientificPython is a collection of Python modules that are useful for scientific computing. In this collection you will find modules that cover basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector and tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear) interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple line plots and 3D wireframe models. There are also interfaces to the netCDF library (portable structured binary files), to MPI (Message Passing Interface, message-based parallel programming), and to BSPlib (Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming). 

  * ["PyDSTool"] - http://pydstool.sourceforge.net -- PyDSTool is an integrated simulation, modeling and analysis package for dynamical systems (including ODEs, DAEs, maps, and hybrid systems) and scientific data. Building on SciPy classes, the package also supports symbolic expression processing, bifurcation analysis, and enhanced arrays for "index-free" and highly contextualized scientific data manipulation. Model building tools use symbolic expression and hierarchical specification classes to ease the development and analysis of complex models. This includes automated compilation of symbolic representations of models into fast numerical code using enhanced legacy Fortran and C integrators for both stiff and non-stiff systems.

 * ["MAPM"] (http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ringx004/mapm-main.html) - Python wrapping in progress
 * GmPy (http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/) - GNU Multiple Precision library wrapping

= The Grid =

Grid is a type of parallel and distributed system that enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of resources distributed across "multiple" administrative domains based on their (resources) availability, capability, performance, cost, and users' quality-of-service requirements.

    * [http://zcologia.org/pcl Python Cartographic Library], [http://zcologia.com/news News from Import Cartographic], a python-friendly module for cartographic programming. The objectives of this Python cartographic library are:
      Match the mapping capabilities of MapServer,
      Explicit programming, less "map file" scripting, and
      Model classes after well known, standard, domain objects. (Noli Sicad)
(Note: GIS should be in Plotting section but could not post there at the moment, problems in posting?!, please move if you can. -- Noli
