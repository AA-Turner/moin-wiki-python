To do list for PyCon.

(Please add items that are not on this list!)

* Get event insurance.
 
 * Make list of affordable Virginia hotels. 

 * (ASAP) Set registration price.

 * (ASAP) Set up registration process and open registration.

* Send call for volunteers to c.l.py.announce

* (Jan 30) Select papers 

* Finalize T-shirt design.

* Arrange T-shirt manufacturing.

* Arrange for equipment (or will the hotel provide it?)

* Select volunteers for registration / security / set-up and tear-down.

* Arrange PyConPromotion.

* Contact Reiters, and see if they want to do a book sale table.  (If that costs us money, it's not worth doing; 
the main store is only a few blocks away, after all.)
