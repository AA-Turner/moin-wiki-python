SageMath here.

This is a new draft page, do not expect much RussHensel started this and should clean it up in the next week or two, it is not linked to anything but my home page now

Please do not delete me, send me an email instead, telling what I did wrong!

I am using SageMath as a general term for several different but closely related things:

==  SageMath General  ==

Generically SageMath is Python plus a lot of math and science extensions plus some SageMath specific extensions. What does it do?  Since it is Python, it does most of what Python does.

Since the math/science extensins have bee added it does what NimPy, Mathplot.... do.

And it does all sorts of math, both numeric and symbolic.  This includes:

 * Algebra
 * Limits
 * Taylor Series
 * Graphing
 * and on and on

==   SageMath Notebook   ==

In this version the user uses a web browser to access "Worksheets"  A worksheet is a series of cells each of which contains some Python code.  Each cell can be executed seperately with the output appearing below the cell.  Worksheets can be saved, opened, downloaded, etc..  Technically the notebook has a web server component which runs either on a seperate machine from the client, or on the same machine.

 ==   SageMath Cloud   ==

This version is similiar to the SageMath Notebook but runs on a beefed up server and offers beefed up services which I will describe later
