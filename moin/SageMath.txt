This is a new draft page, do not expect much yet, working on it,

RussHensel started this and should clean it up in the next week or two, it is not linked to anything but my home page now

Please do not delete me, send me an email instead, telling what I did wrong!

------
SageMath or Sage is an open source implementation of mathematics and scientific software based on Python.  On this page I am using SageMath as a general term for several different but closely related things:

== SageMath General ==
Generically SageMath is Python plus a lot of math and science extensions plus some SageMath specific extensions. What does it do?  Since it is Python, it does most of what Python does.

Since the math/science extensins have bee added it does what NimPy, Mathplot.... do....

And it does all sorts of math, both numeric and symbolic.  This includes:

 * Algebra
 * Limits
 * Taylor Series
 * Graphing
 * and on and on

There are some limitations I am not entirely clear on how extensive they are but seem to stem from the fact that since SageMath is server based you do not have as full control over the server as you do over a machine sitting on your lap.

== SageMath Notebook ==
In this version the user uses a web browser to access "Worksheets".   A worksheet is a series of cells each of which contains some Python code.  Each cell can be executed seperately with the output appearing below the cell.  Worksheets can be saved, opened, downloaded, etc..  Technically the notebook has a web server component which runs either on a seperate machine from the client, or on the same machine.

== SageMath Cloud ==
This version is similiar to the SageMath Notebook but runs on a beefed up server and offers beefed up services which I will describe later.  It is currently in beta release, seems pretty functional.

Work with Sage, or run Python, R, GAP, M2 and more in the Cloud.

== Running on the Web ==
Either version can be run on the web using freely available services.  Generally you need to register to get an account.  There are many more servers than these two, but here are two that are both close to the developers of SageMath:

 * For the notebook:  http://www.sagenb.org/

 * For the cloud:  https://cloud.sagemath.com/?utm_source=sagemath.org&utm_medium=banner

 * There is something called the single cell mode see section below
