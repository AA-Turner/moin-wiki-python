Let's work on making ZODB better!

Leader: Tim Peters

Jim Fulton will present the ZODB architecture as a basis for work.
This will be a good opportunity to learn about many of the 
nitty-gritty details of ZODB.

There are many things we could work, including:

- Documentation

- Bug Fixes

- Code cleanup

- Saner tests

- Multi-database support, http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/MultiDatabases

- Savepoints

- Getting rid of versions

- Database iteration

(Note that you don't have to be a Zope user to be a Zope contributor. :)
