Let's work on making ZODB better!

Leader: Tim Peters

Jim Fulton will present the ZODB architecture as a basis for work.
This will be a good opportunity to learn about many of the 
nitty-gritty details of ZODB.

There are many things we could work on, including:

 * Documentation
 * Adding interfaces (what exactly are the public APIs?  it's become muddy)
 * Bug fixes
 * Code cleanup
 * Saner tests
 * Multi-database support, http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/MultiDatabases
 * Savepoints
 * Getting rid of versions
 * Database iteration (e.g., iterate over all the objects of class Foo; there's no efficient way to do this now, especially when using ZEO)

Note that to be able to make contributions, you must be a Zope contributor: http://dev.zope.org/Subversion
Note that you don't have to be a Zope user to be a Zope contributor. :)
