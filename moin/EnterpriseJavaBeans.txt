Enterprise JavaBeans is a large J2EE-related specification which aims to make it easier to develop "enterprise" applications in Java by encouraging the use of certain architectural patterns and components. Despite the name, it is somewhat different from the JavaBeans specification, and the two should not be confused.

See [http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/web_modules_enterprise.html Python Frameworks and J2EE Standards] for more information.
