It is a library which will serve as a base to develop circuit based applications and educational software on top of it. BinPy is a clear representation of fundamentals. Everything has been written from scratch such as gates, logical operations, etc. This package does not depend on any external library other than pure Python.
We want to extend the hardware programming concepts to Python. We are looking for extremely motivated developers who are willing to break amazing things.

We look forward to add more and more features to this project which simplifies user experience in the world of hardware designing and simulation.
