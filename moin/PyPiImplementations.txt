The goal of this page is to list alternatives to the [:CheeseShopDev:reference implementation], since it's quite hard to find them in any index (most hits will be about packages available ''in'' the package index, not ''about'' it).

== Full implementations ==
Applications that implement the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#package-index-api Package Index API]:
 * [:CheeseShopDev:PyPI] - The reference implementation, powering the main index.
 * [http://chrisarndt.de/projects/eggbasket/ EggBasket] - A simple, lightweight Python Package Index (aka Cheeseshop) clone.

== Tools / Extensions ==

Any of those?
