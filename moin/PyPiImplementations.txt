The goal of this page is to list alternatives to the [:CheeseShopDev:reference implementation], since it's quite hard to find them in any index (most hits will be about packages available ''in'' the package index, not ''about'' it).

== Full implementations ==
Applications that implement the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#package-index-api Package Index API]:
 * [:CheeseShopDev:PyPI] - The reference implementation, powering the main index.
 * [http://chrisarndt.de/projects/eggbasket/ EggBasket] - A simple, lightweight Python Package Index (aka Cheeseshop) clone.
 * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/haufe.eggserver haufe.eggserver] - Grok-based local repository with upload and no security model.

== Tools / Extensions ==

Any of those?

== Things that would be nice ==
 * A local PyPI repository that also allows to proxy / cache external repositories
  * needed in enterprise environments
  * mix and match proprietary and public packages
  * no need for an always-up internet connection (just mostly-up)
  * compare to usual Maven proxies from Java land -- they have these features
  * unlike EnhancedPyPI, puts multi-repo support into the index and thus works with any compliant software w/o change
