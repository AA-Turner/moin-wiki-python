NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimensional array object and associated fast math functions that operate on it.  It also provides simple routines for linear algebra and fft and sophisticated random-number generation.  NumPy replaces both Numeric and Numarray.  http://www.scipy.org and http://www.numpy.org/

A very complete manual by the principal author of Numpy, Travis Oliphant, is [[http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/nlp/Software/NumPyBook.pdf|available]] for free (although donations are accepted). Note that the online documentation via docstring is rather complete and not stripped in any way. Further documentation is available from http://docs.scipy.org/doc/
