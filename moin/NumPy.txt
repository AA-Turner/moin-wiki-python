NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimensional array object and associated fast math functions that operate on it.  It also provides simple routines for linear algebra and fft and sophisticated random-number generation.  NumPy replaces both Numeric and Numarray.  http://numeric.scipy.org

The documentation for NumPy is being sold for a fee.  The link to the free documentation is hard to find due to numpy.sourceforge.net (currently to a broken link).   The free documentation is also not included in the distribution.   Try here:
