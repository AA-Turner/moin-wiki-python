NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimensional array object and associated fast math functions that operate on it.  It also provides simple routines for linear algebra and fft and sophisticated random-number generation.  NumPy replaces both Numeric and Numarray.  http://www.scipy.org and http://numeric.scipy.org

A very complete manual by the principal author of Numpy, Travis Oliphant, is being [http://www.trelgol.com/ sold] for a fee. Note that the online documentation via docstring is rather complete and not stripped in any way. The manual for Numpy's predecessor Numeric is mostly still valid and freely available from [http://numeric.scipy.org/numpydoc/numdoc.htm here] or [http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/ here]. Further documentation is available from http://www.scipy.org/Documentation
