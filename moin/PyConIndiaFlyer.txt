== PyCon India 2009 ==
The first Programmers conference specifically devoted to the Python
language is being held in Bangalore this September. We invite you all
to join, benefit and make the event a success.


== What is PyCon? ==
PyCon is a volunteer driven conference specifically focussing on all
aspects of the Python language and it's community. PyCons are held
throughout the world and all of them are organised by volunteers
passionate about the language and their community. This is first time
a PyCon is being held in India and it promises to be a fun filled two
days of all things Python.

We deliberately keep the registration fees and other expenses low to
maximise participation. This is a community event aimed at growing the
Python community in India.


== What is Python? ==
Python is a very high level dynamically typed programming language
that is growing very rapidly in the corporate and open source spheres.

It's emphasis on cleanliness and programmer productivity has won it
many admirers. Large companies like Google, Rackspace, Industrial
Light and Magic, Youtube etc. use Python in their core applications.

A large number of powerful Open Source applications like Zope, Mailman
etc. are built using Python and have active development communities
around them.

Whether you're looking for an opportunity to develop your technical
skills or to further your career opportunities, Python is something
you should be aware about.

== How do I participate? ==
