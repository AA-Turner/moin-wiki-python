Launchpad is a collection of services including bug tracking, translations and specification tracking.  It is the official Ubuntu bug tracker.

== Python Bugs Import ==

The Python bugs from Source Forge have been imported into a demonstration instance, also containing a copy of the production data:

 * https://demo.launchpad.net/products/python/+bugs

== Accounts ==

Accounts for each bug reporter, assignee or commenter have been created using the `$USERNAME@users.sourceforge.net` address.  People can claim the account using the password recovery page:

 * https://demo.launchpad.net/+forgottenpassword

For people who already had launchpad accounts, the `$USERNAME@users.sourceforge.net` account can be merged here:

 * https://demo.launchpad.net/people/+requestmerge


== Outgoing Email Filter ==

To avoid spamming uninterested people, the outgoing email for the demo Launchpad instance is being filtered.  We can whitelist email addresses on request.

== Old Bug Numbers ==

Each imported SourceForge bug has a nickname assigned of the form "sfNNNN", where NNNN is the old bug number.  This makes it easy to look up bugs by the old SF bug number.  For example, [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1101399&group_id=5470&atid=105470 bug 1101399] is accessible as [https://demo.launchpad.net/bugs/sf1101399]


== Feature Requests ==

We welcome feature requests, which can be filed in Launchpad at:

 * https://launchpad.net/products/launchpad/+filebug

== Comming Soon ==

 * Shorter bug URLs -- the `/products/` part of the URL will go away

== Status ==

 * ownership of python product set to python-infrastructure team
 * bug contact set to python-dev team, whose email address is set to the existing `python-bugs-list@python.org` (not added to the outgoing email filter though, so won't receive email).
 * SourceForge bug data imported.
