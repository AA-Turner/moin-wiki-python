## A quick note to anyone creating a homepage:

## Please only do so if you're providing or promoting Python-related
## content or if you have signed your name on another page (and want
## others to be able to contact you). Pages which are not referenced
## by other pages or which do not provide significant new content will
## be deleted.

I made this wiki account to cleanup old and dead links to other pages. Since this task is repetitive i am thinking of building a bot.

Email: Rather not disclose. In the future, here will be an e-mail address you can spam-rape.

If you want to contact me, either edit this page in a gentle fashion or ask around on the mailing list for my e-mail address. If you do not know which mailing list - well, let's call it spam protection.
