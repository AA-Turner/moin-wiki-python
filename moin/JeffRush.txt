Located in Dallas, my background is in software development for Zope2, Zope3, Twisted, Numeric, ZODB, a bit of Quixote and Durus, and psycopg/Postgre`SQL.  I also am experienced in extending Python using C/C++, most recently to hook Python into the Cepstral/Festival Lite speech synthesis engine and real time ALSA audio playback.

Organizationally I started the [http://www.dfwpython.org DFW Pythoneers ]user group, the affiliated [http://python.meetup.com/10 Python meetup group], am an officer in the [http://www.dfwuug.org DFW Unix user group], cyberarchivist of [http://www.sunless-sea.net Sunless-Sea Xanadu site]and organizer of the [http://xanadu.meetup.com/1 North Texas Xanadu hypertext meetup group].  I also worked with the local group to bring PyCon 2005 to Dallas and will be co-chair for PyCon 2006, also in Dallas.

I'm a self-employed consultant and have worked in robotics, monetary currency recognition/processing, security and packaging of Red Hat RPMs.

Python is my preferred language and what I do for fun.
