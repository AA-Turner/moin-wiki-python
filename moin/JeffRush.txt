Located in Dallas, my background is in software development for Zope2, Zope3, Twisted, Numeric, ZODB, a bit of Quixote and Durus, and psycopg/Postgre`SQL.  I also am experienced in extending Python using C/C++, most recently to hook Python into the Cepstral/Festival Lite speech synthesis engine and real time ALSA audio playback.

Organizationally I started the [[http://www.dfwpython.org|DFW Pythoneers ]]user group, the affiliated [[http://python.meetup.com/10|Python meetup group]], am an officer in the [[http://www.dfwuug.org|DFW Unix user group]], cyberarchivist of [[http://www.sunless-sea.net|Sunless-Sea Xanadu site]]and organizer of the [[http://xanadu.meetup.com/1|North Texas Xanadu hypertext meetup group]].  I also worked with the local group to bring PyCon 2005 to Dallas and will be co-chair for PyCon 2006, also in Dallas.

I'm a self-employed consultant and have worked in robotics, monetary currency recognition/processing, security and packaging of Red Hat RPMs.

Python is my preferred language and what I do for fun.
