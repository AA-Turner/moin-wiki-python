[[http://www.activestate.com|ActiveState|title=ActiveState]] provides end-to-end supply chain security for Python and other open source languages through our ActiveState Platform.

For Python developers, the ActiveState Platform provides:
 * [[https://www.activestate.com/resources/product-demos/activestate-platform-what-to-do-when-you-encounter-a-solver-error/|Advanced Dependency Management|title=Advanced Dependency Management]] - automated dependency resolution to ensure your environments won’t be corrupted on upgrade, as well as simple solutions to dependency conflicts - no more dependency hell.
 * Environment Reproducibility – the ActiveState Platform acts as a central source of truth for your prebuilt Python runtime environments. Because the runtime is prebuilt, your dev and DevOps teams can eliminate “works on my machine” issues and wasted time troubleshooting bugs that turn out to be due to environment misconfigurations.
 * [[https://www.activestate.com/resources/product-demos/activestate-platform-demo-vulnerabilities-remediation/|Vulnerability Remediation|title=Vulnerability Remediation]] - dealing with vulnerabilities can take days of investigating, patching, testing and redeploying. Instead, the ActiveState Platform lets you identify and resolve vulnerable components in minutes, and then automatically rebuild a secure runtime environment.

For security professionals, the ActiveState Platform provides:
 * A catalog of vetted Python packages.
 * A secure, universal build service that builds Python packages and dependencies from source code, including linked C libraries.
 * Signed packages (coming soon!) for Windows, Linux and MacOS featuring non-falsifiable provenance.

The ActiveState Platform integrates with your existing development workflow. It supplies prebuilt Python runtimes for your Dev and CI/CD environments, while providing the security your application needs.
