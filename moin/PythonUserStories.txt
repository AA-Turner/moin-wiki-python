Diversity Comes From People

Diversity is what happens whenever you have enough people in the same place at the same time, whether you realise it or not. Any group of people, regardless of whatever common features they may share, will nonetheless express enormous diversity in other respects. There is no better way to prove diversity that to show the diverse stories of all of the people who are present. Please share your story by answering one simple question, so that you can help to proudly display the diversity of the Python community.

"Why programming, why F/OSS, why Python?"
