Diversity Comes From People

Diversity is what happens whenever you have enough people in the same place at the same time, whether you realise it or not. Any group of people, regardless of whatever common features they may share, will nonetheless express enormous diversity in other respects. There is no better way to prove diversity that to show the diverse stories of all of the people who are present. Please share your story by answering one simple question, so that you can help to proudly display the diversity of the Python community.

"Why programming, why F/OSS, why Python?"


For me, programming is about control, as I'm sure it is for a lot of other people. Although my background is different from most people interested in programming (my degree is in communication), I like programming for the sheer flexibility it gives me. I don't have to depend on other programmers to implement small, simple programs for me. That's also why I like Free and Open Source software. I don't have to be at the mercy of any one person or company. I like Python because of its clarity and simplicity, which make it very attractive to newbie programmers. I can look at Python code and know roughly what it does. It really does look almost exactly like pseudocode! I'd like to see more people with backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences like me programming, whether in Python or anything else. -- DavidDelony <<DateTime(2009-10-24T20:50:53Z)>>
