PyPi, the Python Package Index, is a web-based software distribution mechanism with a recently-added (and somewhat contentious) commenting system.

The real point of this page, however, is to provide some help for the poor unfortunates who do not know that PyPi is also known colloquially as the CheeseShop (due to misplaced enthusiasm for Monty Python humor even when it obscures the real purpose of a piece of software).

So you might want to try searching for 'CheeseShop'. At the time of writing the following two pages are available:

  CheeseShopTutorial

  CheeseShopXmlRpc

More may have been made available since.
