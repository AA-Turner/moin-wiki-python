"If you're looking for a moderate size self-contained task, writing a
replacement for the profile and pstats modules that worked directly with
hotshot data would be a nice little project. Right now, to use hotshot data,
you have to load it up and turn it into profile-compatible data - for any
decent amount of data, this takes a _lot_ of time. Plus, the existing
profiler API is extremely unpythonic."

So said Anthony Baxter.
