== Andrew Cates ==

Email: my first name at http://catesfamily.org.uk/ without the http bit of course. Alternatively you can find me at [http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AndrewCates WardsWiki] or Wiki:AndrewCates if Interwiki works here? 

Beginner on Python but like to look and learn, perhaps I should have a look at PythonBooks. This site has the freshest and best FrontPage and layout I have seen. However the juxtaposition of "Home Help" looks like you are offering to drop round and do the dishes for us, and I am not sure why it doesn't go to the "HelpContents" page...  the SiteNavigation is pretty clear though. 

I'll write a bit more when I have had a look around.
