== Andrew Cates ==

Email: my first name at http://catesfamily.org.uk/ without the http bit of course. Alternatively you can find me at Wiki:AndrewCates or MeatBall:AndrewCates or ZWiki:AndrewCates? 

Beginner on Python but like to look and learn, perhaps I should have a look at PythonBooks. This site has the freshest and best FrontPage and layout I have seen. However the juxtaposition of "Home Help" looks like you are offering to drop round and do the dishes for us, and I am not sure why it doesn't go to the "HelpContents" page...  the SiteNavigation is pretty clear though. 

I'll write a bit more when I have had a look around.

Hey Andrew, I reverted your FrontPage edit in which you capitalized the words 'wiki' and 'wikis'. I'm just following MeatBall:SpellingConventions, so you might want to take a look at that page for the rationale. -- JohannesGijsbers
