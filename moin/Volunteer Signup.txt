(PyCon 2008 list of volunteers: see `Volunteer Signup 2008`_.)

Hello interested volunteer!  Here's where you can find a role that
fits your particular on-site volunteer talents.  Volunteering at Pycon
could possibly be the greatest thing you will ever do.  Ever.  To sign
up, just edit this wiki page, including your name and email address in
the spot you'd like to volunteer for.  In general, the things we're
going to need people for are:

* Registration desk volunteers
* Swag bag stuffers
* Session Chairs: sign up for this role `on the main schedule app page
  <http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/>`_.
* Electrical cord tapers / untapers
* Last minute helper mob


Registration Desk Volunteers
============================

Volunteers are especially needed Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings, from
7:30am on.  Even if you're attending a morning tutorial, you can help
at the desk on Thursday morning.  The registration desk is near the ballrooms.

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and the **days
and times you're volunteering for**, along with any notes (like when
you get to the hotel).  Thank you!

* Grace Law, glaw at slide dot com, Friday morning 7.30 onwards

Swag bag stuffers
=================

This will take place beginning Tuesday evening, through 
Wednesday & Thursday all day (morning to evening), until it's done.

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and **when you
plan to help out**, along with any notes (like when you get to the
hotel).  Thanks!

Electrical cord tapers / untapers
=================================

We may be taping down power strips in the tutorial rooms on Tuesday
evening, and in the ballrooms on Thursday (probably evening).

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and **when you
plan to help out**, along with any notes (like when you get to the

Last minute helper mob
======================

We'll probably need people here and there to help out, if we can call
you or sms message you, that would be great.  Sign up by following the
http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers twitter channel.  Calls for
mob-like volunteer opportunities will go out as the need arises.
