 Pycon 2009 Volunteer Signup
=============================

(PyCon 2008 list of volunteers: see `Volunteer Signup 2008`_.)

Hello interested volunteer.  Here's where you can find a role that
fits your particular on-site volunteer talents.  Volunteering at Pycon
could possibly be the greatest thing you will ever do.  Ever.  To sign
up, just edit this wiki page, including your name and email address in
the spot you'd like to volunteer for.  In general, the things we're
going to need people for are:

* Registration desk volunteers
* Swag bag stuffers
* Session Chairs: sign up for this role `on the main schedule app page
  <http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/>`_.
* Electrical cord tapers / untapers
* Last minute helper mob


Registration Desk Volunteers
============================

Volunteers are especially needed Thursday and Friday mornings, from
7:30am on.  Even if you're attending a morning tutorial, you can help
at the desk on Thursday morning.  The registration desk is in the
Atrium, beside the hotel pool.

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and the **days
and times you're volunteering for**, along with any notes (like when
you get to the hotel).  Thank you!

* Enter name and email here


Swag bag stuffers
=================

**Update:** Bag stuffing is done.  Thanks to everybody who helped!

This will take place Wednesday evening and Thursday all day (morning
to evening) in the Atrium (where the registration desk is).

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and **when you
plan to help out**, along with any notes (like when you get to the
hotel).  Thanks!

Electrical cord tapers / untapers
=================================

**Update:** The team who are setting up A/V for us will be doing this for us too.

We'll be taping down power strips in the tutorial rooms on Wednesday
evening, and in the ballrooms on Thursday (probably evening).

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and **when you
plan to help out**, along with any notes (like when you get to the
hotel).  Merci beaucoup!

* Enter name and email here

Last minute helper mob
======================

We'll probably need people here and there to help out, if we can call
you or sms message you, that would be great.  Sign up by following the
http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers twitter channel.  Calls for
mob-like volunteer opportunities will go out as the need arises.
