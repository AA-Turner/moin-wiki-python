= Pycon 2008 Volunteer Signup =
Hello interested volunteer.  Here's where you can find a role that fits your particular on-site volunteer talents.   Volunteering at Pycon could possibly be the greatest thing you will ever do.  Ever.   To sign up, just edit this wiki page, including your name and email address in the spot you'd like to volunteer for.  In general, the things we're going to need people for are:
 * Registration desk volunteers
 * Swag bag stuffers
 * Electrical cord tapers / untapers
 * Session Chairs (signup for this role will be handled on the main Pycon schedule app, coming soon!)
 * Last minute helper mob
