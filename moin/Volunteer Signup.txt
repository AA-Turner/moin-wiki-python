Registration Desk Volunteers
============================

Volunteers are especially needed Thursday and Friday mornings, from
7:30am on.  Even if you're attending a morning tutorial, you can help
at the desk on Thursday morning.  The registration desk is in the
Atrium, beside the hotel pool.

Please include your **name**, your **email address**, and the **days
and times you're volunteering for**, along with any notes (like when
you get to the hotel).  Thank you!

Last minute helper mob
======================

We'll probably need people here and there to help out, if we can call
you or sms message you, that would be great.  Sign up by following the
http://twitter.com/pyconvolunteers twitter channel.  Calls for
mob-like volunteer opportunities will go out as the need arises.
