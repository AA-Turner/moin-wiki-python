= A Roadmap to Programming Concepts, using Python =

Here are broken out the concepts of programming with Python; essentially a list of ideas, the order in which they might be learned and where the knowledge can be gained.

(needs work)

----
"What mental model is necessary to understand programming?"

 * what is an algorithm?
 * that things happen in sequence
 * and can loop
 * but exceptions can be raised
 * names are bound to values
 * those values can be singles
 * or collections like lists, tuples
 * collections have subscripts, with ranges
 * strings are actually collections
 * mappings are interesting
 * programs have a start and a stop
 * they usually do some setup at the start
 * they may report some status at the stop
 * code can be carried around like a value
 * grouping code with functions reduces complexity
 * modules group code too
 * classes and objects
 * you have a choice of interpreters
    * cpython
    * ipython
    * vpython
    * ironpython
    * jython
    * stackless
