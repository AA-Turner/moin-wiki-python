 * [http://docs.python.org/lib/module-doctest.html doctest module] -- (python standard issue)

doctest.py is a lightweight "literate programming"-style testing framework for python. Released by Tim Peters in 1999 now part of the python standard library.

You define a test by executing some code in an interactive session, and then pasting it along with the output into a nearby docstring. When you run your module at the command-line, doctest executes each one of these code examples, compares the expected and actual output and provides a report.
