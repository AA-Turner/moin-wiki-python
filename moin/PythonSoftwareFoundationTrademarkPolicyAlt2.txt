THIS PAGE IS A DRAFT PSF POLICY DOCUMENT -- NOT FINAL OR OFFICIAL IN ANY WAY!

(This is a more liberal, less restrictive alternative proposal to PythonSoftwareFoundationTrademarkPolicy)

"Python" is a registered trademark, and the Python logo (in several variants) are a trademarks, of the Python Software Foundation.

With all trademarks, even those that apply to open source software, there are certain legally defined requirements for maintaining trademarks.  If these requirements are not met, the trademark is endangered or lost.

One of these requirements is for the trademark owner, in this case the Python Software Foundation, to enforce acceptible use of the trademarks by serving any violators with notice.

The policy that follows is a guideline for what is and is not acceptible use of PSF held trademarks (the word "Python" and
the Python logo or variants of the Python logo).

== General Goals ==

In general, we want "Python" and the Python logos to be used without restriction to refer to the Python programming language.

We do not want them to be used to refer to any other programming language, or in a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated modules, tools, documentation, or other resources with the Python programming language.

Any commercial use of the trademarks in product or company names
must be approved first by the PSF.  Some uses like calling a company "The Python Company", or a product "Python Language" or "Python IDE" will be refused because they are overly broad and confuse whether Python is open source or commercial.

Any commercial use of a derived (modified) logo for any purpose, must also be approved first by the PSF.

== How to Use the Trademarks ==

  * The first use of the word mark "Python" in any formal use should be immediately followed by the symbol for registered trademarks: "®" or "(r)".  For example "Python® ..."

    This requirement is waived in all contexts were such marks are not normally included:  email, online discussion, non-graphical advertisements, and academic papers.  

    We encourage the use of the ® mark whenever possible, but recognize that many non-commercial and informal uses will omit it.

  * The Python logo variants provided by the PSF are accompanied by the symbol for unregistered trademarks: "™" or a small "TM".  This may not be removed or obscured and must always be included with the logo.

  * If the word mark "Python" or logo are used in certain contexts a statement nhould accompany its use:

    ''"Python" and the Python logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Python Software Foundation''
  
    For websites and documentation, this can be on a "legal statements" page.  For advertisements, brochures, and published articles this statement is optional.  For most other uses, it is not required.  

    We encourage use of this statement but recognize many non-commercial and informal uses will omit it.

== Examples ==

There are three classes of trademark uses:

  1) Use of the word "Python" in text or 3rd party logos and trademarks

  2) Use of one of the PSF-provided logo variants in unaltered form

  3) Use of a logo derived from the Python logo -- for example, use of the intertwined snake graphic with different text, or with no text, or in combination with other graphic elements.

=== Use of "Python" ===

  * Use of "Python" in product names like ActivePython, IronPython, Wing IDE for Python, wxPython, Python Extensions, etc -- allowed when referring to use with or suitability for the Python programming language.  For commercial products, contact the PSF for permission.
  
  * Use of "Python" in company names -- Allowed by permission from the PSF.

  * Use of "Python" when redistributing Python as part of an application -- Allowed.  If the version of Python is modified, this should be clearly indicated.

  * Use of "Python" in the name of user groups and conferences -- Allowed if for the Python programming language.

  * Use of "Python" in the name of books or publication like "Python Journal" and "Python Cookbook" -- Allowed if for the Python programming language.

  * Use of "Python" on websites, brochures, documentation, and product packaging -- Allowed if referring to the Python programming language.  Must include (r) symbol and trademark statement in some cases.

  * Use of "Python" in advertisements -- Allowed w/o (r) symbol.

  * Use of "Python" in email and informally -- Allowed w/o (r) symbol.

  * Use of "Python" in academic papers, theses, and books -- Allowed w/o (r) symbol.  Books should include the trademark notice.

  * Use of "Python" in another trademark -- Subject to all other requirements put forth in this policy.  For any commercial use, you must seek permission from the PSF.

=== Unaltered logos ===

  * Using the logo on T-shirts, mugs, etc -- Allowed.

  * Using the logo on websites, brochures, and product packaging -- Allowed.

=== Derived Logos ===

  * Using ''derived'' logos for icons for files and executables -- Allowed if the files are for the Python programming language.  Commercial uses only by permission from the PSF.

  * Using ''derived'' logos for user groups and conferences -- Allowed if dedicated to the Python programming language.  Commercial uses only by permission from the PSF.

  * Using ''derived'' logos for 3rd party modules or tools -- Allowed if for the Python programming language.  Commercial uses only by permission from the PSF.

  * Using ''derived'' logos for other purposes -- May be allowed in some cases.  When in doubt, contact the PSF for permission.

== Notes ==

The word "Python" is a registered trademark in the United States
of America:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=76044902

However, registration is just part of what defines a trademark --
actual use over time is often just as important, especially in
regions where the trademark has not yet been registered officially.
