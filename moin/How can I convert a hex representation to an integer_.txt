== Converting a Hex representation to an Integer ==
I'm running into some trouble when trying to convert a series of hex representations into an integer... I'm sure there is a builtin to do this (wouldn't make sense not to have one) but I can't find it for the life of me.

This is a dump of my interpreter session:
{{{
#!python
>>> file=open("C:/test.m4a")
>>> contents=file.read()
>>> contents.find('user')
592
>>> contents[592:600]
'user\x00\xcc\x15\xa4'
}}}
and I need to convert the values following user ('\x00\xcc\x15\xa4') into an integer value... what am I doing wrong here?

["lwickjr"]: you use 

>>> print int('0a', 16)
10
>>>

...but these aren`t hex values. Try ord() on each character, and see if that gives you the results you need.
