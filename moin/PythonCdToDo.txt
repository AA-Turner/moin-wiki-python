We need some experienced helpers and testers, so if you are interested, please join in here! If you know how to make debian packages (or where to find them), provide some hints where to get the stuff not yet installed.

Current package list: PythonCdRawPackageList

This is the master todo list for PythonCd:
 * (./) adapted my scripts for automizing remastering process.
 * (./) removed stuff not needed from KNOPPIX
 * (./) installed a ton of python packages that I found in debian

 * images and logos
  * pythonic background image, see http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/pyBiblio/images/ - snake.png - thanks to Paul Carduner
   * needs to get 1024x768, so that snake is aligned top right (bsetbg command cant align top right)
  * lilo boot image - maybe derived from http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/py4fun/ ?
  * logo for top left of local moinmoin wiki
 * (./) make wiki running, glue other docs - main page for live CD wiki is PythonCd
 * that "introducing python" mpeg (250MB) is much too big to fit on the PythonCd (on a DVD, it would fit, of course ;) - does anybody have a smaller version with acceptable quality? target should be 25..100MB.
  * KevinAltis made a smaller version of the movie, but it is Quicktime, so that wouldn't work.
 * hosting - we need some server to distribute this, anybody sponsoring space and bandwidth? Possibilities:
  * starship.python.net (acceptable use?)
  * python.org ("when it is ready")
  * Also, we could create a bittorrent file for the ISO image to ease server bandwidth.  And find some CD pressing service that lets people purchase a copy of the CD by mail for only a few bucks.

= Todo from EducationalCd =
 * ["Zope"] and [http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage/ ZODB]
  * requires a zope geek or it rather won't be done

 * PythonApplications (written in Python)
  * GuidovanRobot (Gv``Robot) 
  * WorkforceConnections (courseware through a web interface.)
  * Chandler
  * PyGeo
  * Shtoom
  * PyGE http://pyge.sourceforge.net/
  * QuantLib  (http://quantlib.sourceforge.net/)
  * VPython
  * PyAC # album creator

There are some ready to go apps like 
 * library automation
 * Plone based school setup
that may show something good out of the box. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2004-04-09T18:59:28Z)]]

TODO: move to PythonCdPackages after installing on CD master (see comment at bottom of that page)
