This is the master todo list for PythonCd:
 * (./) adapted my scripts for automizing remastering process.
 * (./) removed stuff not needed from KNOPPIX
 * (./) installed a ton of python packages that i found in debian, still space left
 * (./) installed eric3 - works!
 * images and logos
  * pythonic background image, see http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/pyBiblio/images/ - snake.png
   * needs to get 1024x768, so that snake is aligned top right (bsetbg command cant align top right)
   * thanks to Paul Carduner
  * lilo boot image - maybe derived from http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/py4fun/ ?
  * logo for top left of local moinmoin wiki
 * (./) make wiki running, glue other docs - main page for live CD wiki is PythonCd
 * I will need some experienced helpers and testers, so if you are interested, please join in here.
 * we need some server to distribute this, anybody sponsoring space and bandwidth?

Ideas (additional to them on EducationalCd):
 * add the Windows python stuff also on the linux cd, if there is enough space
