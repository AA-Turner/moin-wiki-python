Tips for those wishing to create and maintain one Python codebase that works for both Python 2.X and Python 3.Y interpreters (for some value of X and Y).

== Why? ==
Seeing [[http://ondrejcertik.blogspot.ch/2013/08/how-to-support-both-python-2-and-3.html|one (very good) rant]] about how hard it is to use the officially blessed way of using 2to3 reminded me that I also ask users on [[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python|Rosetta Code]] to allow code written in a style to work on both versions of Python interchangeably.

I thought we needed some central repository giving tips on how to do this and thought I would start with the rules stated on RC.

== Simple rules for making code work on both 2.X and 3.Y ==
 1. Use brackets in print statements/functions of one expression.
 1. Use zip and not izip; keys(), values(), items() and not their iter- forms.
 1. Check for raw_input and set raw_input to input if not found.
 1. Conditionally import reduce if it is not found.
