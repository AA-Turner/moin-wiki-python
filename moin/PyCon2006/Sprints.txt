== What is a sprint? ==

A sprint is a focused development session, in which developers pair in a room and focus on building a particular subsystem. A sprint is organized with a coach leading the session. The coach sets the agenda, tracks activities, and keeps the development moving. The developers often work in pairs using XP's pair programming approach.

The sprint approach works best when the first few hours are spent getting oriented -- presenting a tutorial for the development material, laying out the stories to tackle for the day, getting everyone a CVS  or SVN checkout to work with.

[http://www.zopemag.com/Guides/miniGuide_ZopeSprinting.html ZopeMag's miniGuide to Zope Sprinting] 
is a good introductory article; just
mentally remove every "Zope" from the article to make it generic.


== Why sprint at PyCon? ==

The sprints are intended to benefit various projects, and to encourage more people to take part in development. They will also be a good place to see ExtremeProgramming or other AgileMethods in action, and to work closely with experienced Python developers.

PyCon will always have a core Python sprint. Other topics will come and go
each year.

If you wish to participate in a sprint, please contact the sprint organizers in advance, or add your name to the list of participants for a given sprint.
