== What is a sprint? ==

A sprint is a focused development session, in which developers pair in a room and focus on building a particular subsystem. A sprint is organized with a coach leading the session. The coach sets the agenda, tracks activities, and keeps the development moving. The developers often work in pairs using XP's pair programming approach.

The sprint approach works best when the first few hours are spent getting oriented -- presenting a tutorial for the development material, laying out the stories to tackle for the day, getting everyone a CVS  or SVN checkout to work with.

[http://www.zopemag.com/Guides/miniGuide_ZopeSprinting.html ZopeMag's miniGuide to Zope Sprinting] 
is a good introductory article; just
mentally remove every "Zope" from the article to make it generic.


== Why sprint at PyCon? ==

The sprints are intended to benefit various projects, and to encourage more people to take part in development. They will also be a good place to see ExtremeProgramming or other AgileMethods in action, and to work closely with experienced Python developers.

PyCon will always have a core Python sprint. Other topics will come and go
each year.

If you wish to participate in a sprint, please contact the sprint organizers in advance, or add your name to the list of participants for a given sprint.

== What equipment/supplies will sprints get? ==

PyCon will supply the following:

  * Room.  Multiple sprints will share the same room; different sprints will presumably occupy different tables. 
  * Wireless networking.
  * Easels, a tablet of paper, and markers.
  * Writing paper and pens (for notes, sketches, etc.).
  * Ice water.

PyCon does ''not'' supply food for the sprint days.  Participants will have to 
go to ["PyCon2006/NearbyRestaurants"], or have food delivered to the hotel.

== Who makes this possible? ==

The [http://www.python.org/psf  Python Software Foundation ]
sponsors the sprints at ["PyCon2006"].
Please consider making a [http://www.python.org/psf/donations.html donation] 
to support this vital community activity!

== IRC ==

Many don't intend to attend to the sprints but would still like to follow the progress/participate via IRC or other means.  Would it be possible for an IRC channel to be setup for use during the sprints?

  Sounds like the #pycon channel mentioned above would be good for this.
