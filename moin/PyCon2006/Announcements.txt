At morning keynote, Wingware would like to announce:

* Wingware is offering a 50% discount off Wing IDE Professional between now and March 5th.  To claim the discount, enter discount code pycon06 in the online store at wingware.com.

* Wingware is also giving away free licenses for sprinters.  See Stephan Deibel or John Ehresman at the Sunday sprint plenary (3:35 PM in Preston Trail) or during the sprinting days to claim your license.

A signup sheet for the lightning talks is on the flyer table near the registration desk; if you want to give a lightning talk, please sign up.  The lightning talks will be 4:15PM on Saturday in the ballroom; they'll be a plenary session, like the keynotes.

Open space talks today: <read list>.

Lost item: a laptop (no case, no power brick).

We have some PyCon 2005 T-shirts available for 
sale: only L and XL sizes, and they're $5 each.  

Shirts will go on sale at the start of the break, a few minutes after the keynote question period ends, so don't feel you have to rush out of the keynote to buy them.

We also have two PyCon 2004 shirts, size XXXL.  They're $10.  <do show-of-hands poll>

We still need session chairs for the following sessions at 3:15PM: "Introduction to CMF Application Development"; and "Extensible Desktop Applications: Abusing the Zope 3 Project".  
Also for the 1:20 Sunday session, "Mission-Critical Python" and "Beyond Scripting: Creating a medical information system."

T-shirt and tote bag supplies are running low.  
If you don't want your tote bag or your T-shirt, you can return
them at the registration desk; they'll certainly find a good home.
