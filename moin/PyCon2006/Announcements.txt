People with an interest in educational uses of Python
will be going out to dinner together.  Please meet in the lobby 
at 7PM.

An education birds-of-a-feather session will follow, whenever everyone gets back from dinner.

T-shirt and tote bag supplies are running low.  
If you don't want your tote bag or your T-shirt, you can return
them at the registration desk; they'll certainly find a good home.
