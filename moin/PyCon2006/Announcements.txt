People with an interest in educational uses of Python

A signup sheet for the lightning talks is on the flyer table near the registration desk; if you want to give a lightning talk, please sign up.  The lightning talks will be 4:15PM on Saturday in the ballroom; they'll be a plenary session, like the keynotes.

We still need session chairs for the following sessions at 3:15PM: "Introduction to CMF Application Development"; and "Extensible Desktop Applications: Abusing the Zope 3 Project".

At morning keynote, Wingware would like to announce:

T-shirt and tote bag supplies are running low.  
If you don't want your tote bag or your T-shirt, you can return
them at the registration desk; they'll certainly find a good home.
