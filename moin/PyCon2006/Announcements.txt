The Python Software Foundation is the non-profit organization that makes PyCon possible by taking on the financial risk of booking the venues far in advance of receiving the money for registrations.  The PSF also uses its financial resources to protect the intellectual property behind Python, keeping it free, and for development grants and in other areas where some money can make a difference to the community.  If you work at a company that uses Python, please consider having your company become a sponsor member of the PSF.  Or, please contribute to the PSF by making donations through the website.  The PSF is a 501(c)3 non-profit so US tax payers can deduct donations from their taxes.

Reminder: 50% off Wingware IDE until Sunday March 5th; enter the code 'pycon06' at wingware.com's store.

We'll be here again next year (date still to be announced); and will be strongly and loudly encouraging them to improve their wireless.
