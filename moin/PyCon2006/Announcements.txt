= Thursday announcements =

The first afternoon session will be starting about 10 minutes late.  This means the afternoon break will start around 3:05PM, not 2:55PM as scheduled.  (The snacks will be laid out around 2:55PM, following the old schedule, so if you can end your session a bit early, please do.  But don't force speakers to truncate their talks unless they're willing.)

The second afternoon session will start at 3:15PM, as scheduled.

Lost items: an iPod; a laptop and case; and a brown corduroy jacket. 

People with an interest in educational uses of Python
will be going out to dinner together.  Please meet in the lobby 
at 7PM.

An education birds-of-a-feather session will follow, whenever everyone gets back from dinner.

T-shirt and tote bag supplies are running low.  
If you don't want your tote bag or your T-shirt, you can return
them at the registration desk; they'll certainly find a good home.
