A signup sheet for the lightning talks is on the flyer table near the registration desk; if you want to give a lightning talk, please sign up.  The lightning talks will be 4:15PM on Saturday in the ballroom; they'll be a plenary session, like the keynotes.

Lost items: a brown corduroy jacket. 

People with an interest in educational uses of Python
will be going out to dinner together.  Please meet in the lobby 
at 7PM.

An education birds-of-a-feather session will follow, whenever everyone gets back from dinner.

== Optional (URLs are annoying to read out) ==

T-shirt and tote bag supplies are running low.  
If you don't want your tote bag or your T-shirt, you can return
them at the registration desk; they'll certainly find a good home.
