= Audience =
Python programmers with a desire to
understand how to build cross-platform database
applications.

= Summary =
This tutorial will introduce the student to the
relational model and SQL. It will present the DB API
and show how it can be used in a relatively
platform-independent way to maintain source
portablility of Python database applications.

Pre-registered students will receive access to
electronic copies of the course notes and example
materials to allow them to run the examples presented
in the tutorial.

To undertake the practical examples
they should have a database installed on their laptop
with a DB API-compliant Python interface, and should be able
to create a database for use in class. The examples
should work on MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft Access
at the very least, and the materials will contain programs to
create the necessary database to support the examples.

Before class students should verify their ability to connect
to the newly-created database from Python.
