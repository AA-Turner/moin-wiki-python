If you want to do graphics, sound, and non-stdio user interaction in
Python, PyGame offers you a nicely-wrapped interface to SDL -- and to
some handy SDL libraries for drawing, fonts, image formats, and
transformation, plus efficient interaction with Numeric/numpy arrays.

This tutorial will take you through the basics of the PyGame library
by way of a few simple sample applications.  It will not focus on
games: topics of general interest will be covered, as opposed to
game-specific topics such as plot, pacing, and frame rate.

The tutorial will include some hands-on experience changing sample
PyGame-based python programs, but will be mostly lecture (with the
opportunity to ask questions).  We will not be covering sound, fonts,
sprites, or Numeric/numpy interaction.

--------------------
Intended Audience: Intermediate Python programmers

(experienced SDL programmers are unlikely to learn anything)
