''This talk has been cancelled.  Anyone with questions about this topic is welcome to contact [Mailto:alex.perry@ieee.org].''

The software of a future product can be quickly implemented using
portable Python, whether on Linux, Mac, Windows, or another platform.
Once tested to ensure that it meets all requirements, one can just
merge those directories of Python code with a board support package,
directly generating the download image for the device's Flash.

Small embedded devices, using Linux or a similar kernel, have often
used Busybox to provide a basic posix like command line environment.
Since this is similar, but not identical to a workstation's tools,
there is effort involved in adapting scripts and configurations.
Similarly, once the primary application purpose is loaded and running,
that SysV boot environment unnecessarily costs several megabytes
of RAM (since INIT remains) as well as additional megabytes of Flash.

This talk explains how to omit all non-Python software components
and demonstrates the procedure with a simple Twisted Python program.
