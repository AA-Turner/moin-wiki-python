= Internet Programming with Python =

'''Description'''

Python is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming
language that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of
which is Internet programming. This tutorial introduces current Python
programmers to three distinct areas of Internet programming, each in
self-contained one-hour lectures:

 * Network Programming using Sockets -- underneath all of today's network protocols, i.e., web/HTTP, FTP, database connections, IM conversations, online gaming, e-mail exchange, etc., lies the root communication mechanism, sockets.  Here, we introduce client-server architecture and how to program sockets using Python.
 
 * Internet Client Programming -- one level higher than sockets are well-known Internet protocols such as FTP, NNTP, and POP3.  In this hour, we learn how to use Python's standard library to create clients of those and other Internet protocols.

 * CGI Programming -- yes, pure CGI is "sooo yesterday," but before you jump on all the web framework bandwagons, it's a good idea to learn basics and the '''basis''' of how all web servers deliver dynamic content back to the client browser so that you can appreciate all the work that is done on your behalf by a more full-featured framework.

This tutorial gives a concise and comprehensive introduction to each
of these topics so attendees can "start coding back in their hotel
room". A demonstration of code follows each lecture topic.  We have
had great success and feedback giving this tutorial in the past, such
