== Agile development and testing in Python ==


We will present a Python application that we developed together as an
"agile team", using agile development and testing approaches,
techniques and tools. The value of the tutorial will consist on one
hand in detailing the development and testing methodologies we used,
and on the other hand in demonstrating specific Python tools that we
used for our development and testing. We will cover TDD, unit testing,
code coverage, functional/acceptance testing, Web application testing,
continuous integration, source code management, issue tracking, project
management, documentation, Python package management.

=== Presentation outline ===

1st hour:
 * Intro: agile development and testing concepts
 * SCM (subversion) and issue tracking/project management (Trac)
 * TDD/unit testing (py.test, doctest, nose)
 * unit tests as documentation (doctest and epydoc)

2nd hour:
 * code coverage (the coverage module)
 * source code analysis (pylint, pyflakes)
 * acceptance/functional testing (PyFit/FitNesse, TextTest)
 * performance testing (FunkLoad, twill)

3rd hour:
 * Web application testing with Selenium and twill
 * Scripting Selenium tests using a Twisted-based server
 * Python package management (distutils, setuptools, Cheesecake index)
 * Continuous integration and 'smoke test' (buildbot)
