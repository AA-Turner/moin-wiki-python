== Agile development and testing in Python ==


We will present a Python application that we developed together as an
"agile team", using agile development and testing approaches,
techniques and tools. The value of the tutorial will consist on one
hand in detailing the development and testing methodologies we used,
and on the other hand in demonstrating specific Python tools that we
used for our development and testing. We will cover TDD, unit testing,
code coverage, functional/acceptance testing, Web application testing,
continuous integration, source code management, issue tracking, project
management, documentation, Python package management.
