Ideas for Panels.

= Panel on Concurrency =

Given the amount of debates surrounding concurrency models, apparent misunderstanding of threads as a necessary model for concurrency, and the fact that language-level features may provide new opportunities for concurrent programming (i.e. generators), why not setup a Panel with some key opiniated people, to discuss concurrency models tradeoffs and heat up a bit of discussion?

I'm thinking about the following approaches, and selecting a person to defend/represent viewpoints w.r.t. to those, with maybe a 10 min presentation each, and then some discussion and questions:

- Threaded programming -- still hard.  Why?
- Deferreds -- Twisted, what benefits have been gained thru this experience?
- Generators, Stackless, Greenlets -- new control flow structures
- Multi-process -- So many methods to do IPC...

Could be interesting.  Just a suggestion.  --blais
