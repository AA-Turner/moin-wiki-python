 * We need a new location.
 * Have a dedicated tutorial track on at least one day.
 * One person suggested a track at reduced cost aimed at       teenagers.  That's an interesting idea; we could have it on the Friday        when attendance is at its lowest, and rustle up speakers on game  programming, tutorial topics, and other stuff. 
 * Make organization of Open Space more apparent.
 * We should post a list of talks + abstracts outside each room so  people know what's going on.
 * Keynote speakers should be relevant to Python.
