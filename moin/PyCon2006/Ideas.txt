 * We need a new location.
 * Have a dedicated tutorial track on at least one day.  (Perhaps paralleling the open space?)
 * Have a newcomer's track on the first day: intro to Python, PyCon, open space.
 * One person suggested a track at reduced cost aimed at       teenagers: ["PyCon2006/TeenagerTrack"].  That's an interesting idea; we could have it on the Friday        when attendance is at its lowest, and rustle up speakers on game  programming, tutorial topics, and other stuff. 
 * Make organization of Open Space more apparent.
 * Make SubEthaEdit notes an officially supported thing, and part of the proceedings
 * We should post a list of talks + abstracts outside each room so  people know what's going on.
 * Keynote speakers should be relevant to Python.
 * From EuroPython: Have multiple tracks, and track chairs responsible for each one.
 * Pay airfare and/or hotel for some invited speakers
 * Sponsorship: mention that amounts are suggested minimums, not requirements
 * Social events: a game night; a jam session (Barry thinks he can get most of the required equipment, or rent it).
 * Get session chairs to estimate attendance in their sessions (half full, full, near-empty); this will let us calibrate our understanding of what topics people are interested in.
 * Cut down food quantities a bit on the last day
 * Have coffee at lunchtime
 * Advertise conference more to local university students
 * Get projector and run slide show at registration (announcements, lost/found items, open space, etc.)
 * Make lightning talks a plenary session
 * Encourage formal speakers to also do a lightning talk based on their presentation
 * Give sessions titles (e.g. "Web Development", "Networking", "Grab Bag")
