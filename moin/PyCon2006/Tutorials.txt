Describe PyCon2006/Tutorials here.

= Ideas for Tutorials =

What specifically are people looking for in the tutorial sessions on Thursday?

== Using Unittest ==
How can I use unittest to run unit test?  In particular, if I have a process consisting of a number of objects, I know how to write the unittest for each indivudual object using the "if __name__ == '__main__' trick, but how can I combine all of the indivudal unittests into one "master blaster" test that can be run nightly to insure the integrity of the process?

== "Python 102" ==
Once you've learned the language, then what?
This type of tutorial could go in a couple different directions:

 * Explaining what it means for a program to be "Pythonic" (The proper / appropriate use of Python idioms and taking advantage of the features of the language)
 * How to best use some of the available libraries
 * How to read and use the available documentation

== "Getting Started with Twisted" ==
An introduction into this incredible networking framework

Topics could include:
 * Understanding program flow in an asynchronous environment
 * Use of specific Twisted features, such as PB
 * How to read and understand the documentation

== "GUI Programming in Python" ==
How to write a user-driven program using one of the available toolkits such as wxPython.

== "Getting Started with Zope" ==
Soup-to-nuts, a complete walkthrough from installation to your first dynamic web page.
