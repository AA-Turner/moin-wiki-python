Describe PyCon2006/Tutorials here.

= Ideas for Tutorials =

What specifically are people looking for in the tutorial sessions on Thursday?

== Using Unittest ==
How can I use unittest to run unit test?  In particular, if I have a process consisting of a number of objects, I know how to write the unittest for each indivudual object using the "if __name__ == '__main__' trick, but how can I combine all of the indivudal unittests into one "master blaster" test that can be run nightly to insure the integrity of the process?

== "Python 102" ==

This type of tutorial could go in a couple different directions:
