= Tutorial Instructors =

This is a place for tutorial instructors to pool their resources, make AV equipment inquiries, discuss materials, and ask questions.  Specifically, I'd like to talk about:

 * Material duplication:
  * [http://wiki.python.org/moin/PrintShopsNearby2006 Link to PrintShops nearby]
  * Duplicating at home and bringing them to Dallas?
  * Doing them in Dallas near the venue and arringing delivery or pickup? (if so, who?)
  * OR not going to provide materials at all?
  * For those who are, what is your timetable?  Pick provider yet?

 * Anyone using more than a projector and microphone?

 * How would people feel about contributing their notes to a compendium and having the organizers sell it as a volume to all attendees?
  * This is meant for those who either could not attend a tutorial that they wanted to because they're going to one that's more important to them, i.e., time conflict
  * Or it could be for those who could not attend tutorials at all but want the material
  * Would you expect remuneration?  If so, how much?
  * Remaining funds could be used to help offset conference costs or saved for the next PyCon

''I'm interested in what everyone has to say... pls feel free to edit this page.  I may arrange to arrive earlier Wednesday afternoon, so I could help out with materials if need be.  -Wesley (wescpy at gmail.com) 12/31/05''
