At PyCon, AMK is planning to have a session on Thursday evening to play board games.  It will be at 7PM, in the Bent Tree II room.

It'll probably work like this: I'll set up the games beforehand, and as people show up, they get grouped together in sets of four or six and choose a game, or are assigned one.  I explain the rules and get the group started.

I'll box up a bunch of my games and Fedex them to myself at the hotel.  However, there are probably local attendees who can also bring games.  If you're coming to PyCon and can bring something, please add your name to this page and say what you can bring.

What I'm planning to bring:
 * Carcassonne, of course!
 * Through the Desert (which means that Barb and I need to play the game again before the con)
 * La Strada
 * Travel Blokus
 * I'll probably throw in Fluxx and Set, too, because they're in small packages.

Possibilities: I could bring Elfenland, but explaining the rules is fairly complicated, though they're not hard once you understand them.
Anyone else familiar with the game who could explain it better?

The emphasis is on multiplayer games that can handle four or six people. I don't think two-player games are very practical for me to bring,  because I'd have to bring so many of them; hopefully local attendees can bring chess, go, checkers, etc.
