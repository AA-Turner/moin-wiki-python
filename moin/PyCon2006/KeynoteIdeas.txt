Here are some people who have been suggested as keynote speakers.

= Top Choices (prioritized =

 * Limi and Runyan (Plone)
 * Jon Udell (InfoWorld)
 * Mark Hammond, who is making Python a first-class scripting language in the
 Mozilla platform: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/008865.html + someone from Mozilla like  Mitchell Baker or Asa Dotzler
 * Tim O'Reilly

= More or less Python related =

 * Eric Raymond - unofficially contacted, is interested.
 * Bram Cohen (BitTorrent)
 * Someone from Firaxis to talk about and show Python in the Civilization IV game
 * David Ascher
 * Laura Creighton
 * timbot
 * Evelyn Mitchell
 * effbot
 * Gitte Wange
 * MvL
 * MAL
 * Greg Wilson
 * Andy Hertzfeld

= General Tech related =

 * Mark Shuttleworth '''declined'''

 * Vernor Vinge (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge)
 * Sam Ruby
 * Alan Kay
 * Bill Joy
 * Jonathan Corbet of Linux Weekly News
 * Ray Kurzweil (http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html)
 * Vint Cerf (http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/cerf.html) "The Interplanetary Internet"

= Potential topic ideas =

 * New/Emerging Opportunities for Python
 * Python's biggest success (BitTorrent?)
 * Python at (a large visible organization, such as Disney, Lucasfilm, NASA)
 * The New New thing: Ruby on Rails
 * Taking Python Mainstream
 * Something really sexy, like scripting a popular game in python (Civilization IV comes to mind, it should be released by then)
 * How to change the world (for the better) with Python

''(Judging by the feedback forms, people really do want Python-related keynotes.  For 
example, a number of people thought Mitch Kapor's keynote was interesting but didn't have enough Python content.  So I think the Ruby on Rails idea would never fly. --amk)''
