''If you know the area, help draw up a list of nearby restaurants.  Here's a start:''

 * A link to the [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14901+Dallas+Parkway+addison,+tx&spn=0.021963,0.040525&hl=en GMaps page] for the conference center, to serve as a convenient starting point for GMaps directions to places below.

 * A quick query of [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=restaurant*&sll=32.951893,-96.823449&spn=0.060416,0.059768&sspn=0.127192,0.125828&num=10&start=0&hl=en restaurants nearby], for the truly lazy

From JeffRush's email:

The Addison hotel is in the center of an entertainment district.  On the 
corner of the hotel is a comedy club and at least four nice sports bars, 
for discussing Python over a beer.  ;-) 

The main avenue along there is covered in restaurants:
 * Landry's seafood
 * Clay Pit indian
 * Chili's
 * Snuffer's burgers, etc.

For super late night there is:
 * Vernon's, my favorite bar/grill that serves food until 2am 7-days a week, and
 * a 24-hour Denny's
 * The restaurant at the hotel closes at 10pm.

For close-in sightseeing, there is small airport within half a mile of 
the hotel, with Cavanaugh's aerial museum.  Lunching at several small 
places around the airport, with the planes coming toward you and taking 
off just over the restaurant is neat too.  One BBQ place had a 
control-tower radio playing over the speakers in their dining area.

 * The town of Addison maintains [http://www.addisontexas.net/where_to_eat/ a list of local restaurants].

I've heard that Belt Line in Addison between 35 and the Tollway has the highest concentration of restaurants in the USA. Shouldn't be a problem.

KevinHorn (a dallas native) sez:

I don't know about the concentration of restaurants on Belt Line being the highest in the nation, but I DO know that Addison has more restaurants per capita than any other city in the US...and a LOT of them are on the Belt Line strip.

Here are a few of my favorites:
 * [http://www.freebirds.com/slow/locations.htm Freebirds World Burrito] has FANTASTIC burritos!  A great place for lunch.  Think kinda like Subway, but with burritos instead of sandwiches.
 * Nate's Seafood is world reknowned...Pope John Paul II ate there once!
 * The Londoner is a great British-style pub.  Lots of good beers on tap (not just mass-market American crud...yes, I'm a beer-snob :) )
 * The Clay Pit (Indian food) referenced above...I've never eaten there, but one of the owners is a former co-worker of my wife, and it comes highly recommended.
 * BJ's (also above) is quite good.
 * There's a great greasy spoon type place across teh street from teh Londoner, but the name escapes me.
 * The Blue Goose -- the second best Mexican food in Dallas (IMNSHO), but has the best fajitas.
 * Christina's -- aha, I knew you were going to ask...this is the BEST Mexican in Dallas (except for fajita's...again just my opinion)
 
There are also most of the national chain restaurants: Chili's, Benigan's, T.G.I. Friday's, Outback Steakhouse, etc.

And of course the usual fast food joints.

Really too many eateries to list here...there are literally HUNDREDS of restaurants in Addison, and it's not a very big town (pop. around 14,000)

[http://lazutkin.com/blog/ Eugene Lazutkin] (local):

I have a private page of good lunch places I visit regularly: 

http://home.comcast.net/~elazutkin/Articles/LunchBox2.0.html.

It was made for my friends, and lists only '''good food''' restaurants. Don't be afraid --- they are open for dinner too. You can find location of all places and my notes on the interactive map.
