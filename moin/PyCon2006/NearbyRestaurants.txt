From JeffRush's email:

The Addison hotel is in the center of an entertainment district.  On the 
corner of the hotel is a comedy club and at least four nice sports bars, 
for discussing Python over a beer.  ;-) 

The main avenue along there is covered in restaurants:
 * Landry's seafood
 * Clay Pit indian
 * Chili's
 * Snuffer's burgers, etc.

For super late night there is:
 * Vernon's, my favorite bar/grill that serves food until 2am 7-days a week, and
 * a 24-hour Denny's
 * The restaurant at the hotel closes at 10pm.

For close-in sightseeing, there is small airport within half a mile of 
the hotel, with Cavanaugh's aerial museum.  Lunching at several small 
places around the airport, with the planes coming toward you and taking 
off just over the restaurant is neat too.  One BBQ place had a 
control-tower radio playing over the speakers in their dining area.

 * The town of Addison maintains [http://www.addisontexas.net/where_to_eat/ a list of local restaurants].
