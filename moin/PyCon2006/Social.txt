A social event is anything that isn't strictly technical in nature.

 * GPG keysigning BoF
 * Board game session
 * There will probably be a social event hosted at a local tech bookstore.

= Board Games =

AMK wants to run a 2- or 3-hour session where people can show up
and play a variety of board games such as 
[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=822 Carcassonne], 
[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9675 La Strada], etc.

  * What games would you like to see?
  * What games can you bring?

''Damn, and here I was leaning towards going to EuroPython next year, and you go and introduce board games into the mix -- RichardJones''

''As a _long_ time gamer, I'm _definitely_ interested in this. I can bring two or three different games if desired. -- Ken Whitesell''

''This sounds like a great idea. I can bring my extended [http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/ munchkin] collection to the table (super-star-fu-bites-munchkin-blender anyone?) -- MichaelTwomey''

''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game) Go (aka Igo/Weichi/Baduk)] anyone?''

  * I'm a Go player; I'd love to have a game or three.  Who's asking? -- DavidGoodger

''I'll concentrate on bringing some modern German-style board games that are fairly easy to learn, so that new arrivals can play something entertaining. --amk''

= Dinner =

There should be some place for people to meet up for dinner; without that
someone without dinner plans who wants to be social has to hang out awkwardly
and make eyes at other people in order to form a dinner
group.

''Got a protocol suggestion for this?  Do we just need a 'Meet for Dinner Here' sign,
and some explanation in the conference materials?  --amk''

Yes, just a sign, maybe a quick announcement at lunch or something.  -- IanBicking

''Possibly a couple different signs/locations-to-meet for people who may want to go to specific places to eat. -- Ken Whitesell''

Just about every major restaurant chain has a store in the area, but they're the same Applebee's and Bennigan's as anyplace else.  The Trail Dust is not as close, but is more of a Texas steakhouse. -- PaulMcGuire


= Music? =

An important thing about a social event is that it really can be social, that means you can meet and talk to people. Meeting and talking to interesting people is one of the most interesting things at such a conference (you could read introductionary level papers as html or pdf published to the internet, too).

At  some conferences and social events someone thought that there needs to be '''loud music''', making it rather impossible to talk (or rather, to hear what somebody more far away than 40cm from you was saying). For me, this basically destroys a social event, as I will just collect some other annoyed people and leave, searching for a more silent place where one can talk about all sorts of interesting things.

So please: Don't confuse a social event for developers with a disco. If you want to visit a disco or hear loud music, you can do every other day.


= Local Pythonista-finder =

One of the things we had trouble with in getting a Python Meetup going here in 
Austin was that everyone is *so* busy.  I hope to be pleasantly surprised at all the
Texas Pythoneers that show up at a PyCon so close to home, and I expect there might be
similar clusters of folks in other locations.  Is there any way we could put up a 
map or two (US/Texas/world) for people to pin their home state/country? -- PaulMcGuire
