A social event is anything that isn't strictly technical in nature.

 * GPG keysigning BoF
 * Board game session
 * There will probably be a social event hosted at a local tech bookstore.

= Board Games =

AMK wants to run a 2- or 3-hour session where people can show up
and play a variety of board games such as 
[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=822 Carcassonne], 
[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9675 La Strada], etc.

  * What games would you like to see?
  * What games can you bring?

''Damn, and here I was leaning towards going to EuroPython next year, and you go and introduce board games into the mix -- RichardJones''


= Dinner =

There should be some place for people to meet up for dinner; without that
someone without dinner plans who wants to be social has to hang out awkwardly
and make eyes at other people in order to form a dinner
group.

''Got a protocol suggestion for this?  Do we just need a 'Meet for Dinner Here' sign,
and some explanation in the conference materials?  --amk''

Yes, just a sign, maybe a quick announcement at lunch or something.  -- IanBicking
