#acl All:read
We'll be working on a Django-based application to be used for PyCon 2007.

== Goals ==

 * A first-draft system, and plans for its future development

== Requirements ==

This section lists features that the final system should support.  We'll prioritize which ones 
to work on at the sprint.

 * Paper submission, processing, and acceptance
 * Assembling the schedule
 * Registration
 * Attendee feedback, during and after the conference
 * Admin interfaces for changing registrations
 * Sending e-mails to various subsets of users (e.g. all attendees, all committee members, all accepted authors)

 * Most properties should be configurable (e.g. conference name, critical dates, prices), though maybe not through the web.

Some ideas for the paper-submission portion are at 
<http://www.amk.ca/w/ConferenceSWIdeas>.

== Participants ==

Please list your name here if you think you'll make it.

Stephan Deibel -- If there is a pydotorg sprint, which is still not certain, I may have to do that instead or in addition.
 * Martin Thomas - though trying to decide how to split self between this and Django

== Notes ==
