The Array Interface is documented at http://numeric.scipy.org/array_interface.html

It would add the scientific computing community if this array interface were adopted by Python by getting a simple array object that carries the interface into the Python core.  The goal of this sprint would be to write such an object.

Please post an interest email to scipy-dev@scipy.net if you are planning on coming to this event.
