About
=====

The primary goal of the sprint is to port Stackless to the latest version of Python, which at this time is 2.4.2.  This involves bringing the Stackless CVS up to date with all the changes made to Python since version 2.3.3 in order to maintain the history of stackless changes made.

Other ways you can contribute if you are interested are:

- Documenting Stackless / improving the web site.

  - Making Stackless more approachable for new users.
  - Writing examples.

- Writing tests.
- Improving the web site.
- Any other way you can think of that will benefit Stackless!

As Christian will also be attending the PyPy sprint, which is to be held
in the same alloted sprint time (after the conference) his role will
generally be to guide those that are there in doing the
required work.

If you have any questions about this sprint, the `Stackless mailing list <http://www.stackless.com/mailman/listinfo/stackless>`__ is the best place to ask.
