=====

The goal of this sprint is to port Stackless to Python 2.4.2.  Additional goals are to comprehensively document the process so that porting to later versions of Python can be done in a more timely fashion by the community.

If you have any questions about this sprint, the `Stackless mailing list <http://www.stackless.com/mailman/listinfo/stackless>`__ is the best place to ask.
