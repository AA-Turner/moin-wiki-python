Chat/help on IRC at #pydotorg on freenode.net

To join the project, ask on IRC to be added to the Trac notification
list and the pydotorg mailing list.

To get set up with a copy of the site you need first to 
install Pyramid as described at http://pyramid.pollenation.net

Then check out https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org
and see build/README to build and run the site on your machine

Also needed for conversion will be the old python.org content which
can be checked out of https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/pydotorg
