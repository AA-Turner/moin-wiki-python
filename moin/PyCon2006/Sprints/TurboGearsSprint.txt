== TurboGears Sprint at PyCon ==

We're going to be building up new features and squashing stubborn bugs at the TurboGears Sprint at PyCon. This sprint will come after the first TurboGears 0.9 release happens and will be a good chance to fix things up for 1.0 and start on features that will land post-1.0.

Experienced Python (and/or JavaScript!) programmers are welcome. Even without prior experience with TurboGears, there will be plenty you can contribute.

Discussion about this sprint will take place on the [http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears-sprint turbogears-sprint@googlegroups.com] mailing list.
