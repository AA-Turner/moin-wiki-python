== TurboGears Sprint at PyCon ==

We're going to be building up new features and squashing stubborn bugs at the TurboGears Sprint at PyCon. This sprint will come after TurboGears 1.0 is released and will be a good opportunity to build up great new features for post-1.0.

Experienced Python (and/or JavaScript!) programmers are welcome. Even without prior experience with TurboGears, there will be plenty you can contribute.

Discussion about this sprint will take place on the [http://groups.google.com/group/turbogears-sprint turbogears-sprint@googlegroups.com] mailing list.

== Time ==

Whether this sprint will take up the full 4 days is up for discussion on the mailing list. This will be dependent on available participants.

== Topics ==

This section will be added once TurboGears 0.9 is released.
