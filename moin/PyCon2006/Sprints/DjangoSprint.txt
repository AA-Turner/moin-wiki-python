We'll have an introductory session Sunday (2/26) afternoon  (around 3:30) to get to know each other and plan
out the goals, followed by four days (2/27-3/2) of sprinting.  Exactly what we'll work on will be determined at the planning meeting.  Below are the ideas we'll discuss at the planning meeting:

 * Wrap up magic-removal (and merge to trunk if we get that far).

 * Bug fixes - we should come out of the sprint with no serious (i.e. crash-level) bugs.

 * Review and apply outstanding patches.

 * Work on Oracle/MSSQL/ODBC/??? database backends.

 * Documentation improvements - leave no stone undocumented.

 * Work on a Django application repository ("Django standard library").

 * Schema evolution.

 * Transactions

 * Multiple authorization backends (LDAP, OpenID, ...?)

 * Proving our mousey worth.
 
 * Shooting each other in the face.
 
 * [http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/LittleEasyImprovements other easy stuff.]
