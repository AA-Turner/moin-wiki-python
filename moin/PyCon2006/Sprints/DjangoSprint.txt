We'll have an introductory session Sunday afternoon, followed by four days of sprinting.  Exactly what we'll work on will be determined closer to the actual event, but will like be among the following:

 * Bug fixes - we should come out of the sprint with no serious (i.e. crash-level) bugs.

 * Documentation improvements - leave no stone undocumented.

 * Work on a Django application repository.

 * Automatic schema evolution.

 * Proving our mousey worth.
