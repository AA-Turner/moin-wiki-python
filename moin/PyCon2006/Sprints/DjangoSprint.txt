We'll have an introductory session Sunday (2/26) afternoon  (around 3:30) to get to know each other and plan
out the goals, followed by four days (2/27-3/2) of sprinting.  Exactly what we'll work on will be determined closer to the actual event, but will like be among the following:

 * Bug fixes - we should come out of the sprint with no serious (i.e. crash-level) bugs.

 * Documentation improvements - leave no stone undocumented.

 * Work on a Django application repository.

 * Automatic schema evolution.

 * Multiple authorization backends (LDAP, ...)

 * Proving our mousey worth.
