Possibilities include:
 * Implementing PEPs

   * PEP 328 absolute/relative import

   * PEP 343 implementation ('with:')

   * PEP 308 implementation ('x if y else z')

   * PEP 302 suggestions (fix pydoc and traceback printing to support zipfiles, implement sys.meta_path objects for built-in, frozen, and sys.path importers; search for "phase 2" in the PEP for other ideas)

 * AST work

   * export AST to Python

       *  Basic pychecker functionality

   * rewrite peepholer to use AST instead of modifying bytecode directly (where applicable)

   * Finish work on ast-objects branch

 * Patch/bug processing

   * Incorporate PEP content into the LaTeX docs

   * Bugs to look at: SF:777884 (needs ruling from an XML/minidom maintainer)

   * Patches to look at: SF:686545 (mailbox modification -- SoC-supported work)

 * Build

   * Rewrite setup.py (for simplification and easier customization)
