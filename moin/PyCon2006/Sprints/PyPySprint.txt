A few PyPy developers will be present at PyCon2006.  At that point in
time we expect the Just-In-Time compiler to be under heavy development,
but we don't have to work on it, depending on the interest of the people
present.  The goals of the sprint are not specified in advance: we can
do work in any area of PyPy that interests you.

You can mention your participation and talk about your interests in the
pypy-dev mailing list (http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev).
