What sorts of papers and open space events would you like to see?

Anything on object databases, such as Durus, Schevo, and ZODB.

Plone - perhaps a mini-bootcamp tutorial

Pygame - How to use in games and non-games (like Armin's talk last year!)

Pypy - a deeper look into it. News / plans about it.

Unununium - the python OS.

SciPy, Numeric, BioPy

wxPython - Especially something beyond "how to create your first wxPython app"
