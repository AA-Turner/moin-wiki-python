Other comments
''''''''''''''''''

The wxPython tutorial was great! I want a sequel.

The Agile tutorial wasn't really a tutorial, but more like a regular
talk but longer. They gave a brief overview of a lot of testing
technologies rather than actually teaching any single one. Useful, but
not really a tutorial.

----

I think the interview idea for the keynote was not a very good
idea. It was a bit boring and not very effective.

Some talks didn't have any coordinators so presenters were a bit lost
at start.

----

overall really good.  i have been to oscon twice and the level of
service has been about the same.  they had wireless problem there one
year also and still throughout the conference.

i like marriot, the beds are really comfy, would love to have them get
a reduced/free internet from the room rate.

better way to guage interest in specific talks to guage room size
(oscon struggled with this also)

there seems to be two different descriptions of each talk on the web
site.. one in a wiki and one in a db.  the wiki one was much easier to
read.

----

Less tippy, spilly food (pasta, soup).  We need to figure the wireless
situation out, it was obviously horrible.  Otherwise, I really liked
the hotel.  I wasn't sure why the Plone thing was a keynote.  I kind
of liked the friday+weekend situation, because otherwise my work tends
to intrude.

----

I would like to see more about approaching a collaborative approach to
combining some of the best features of the various frameworks
available.  Too often, I feel, each project is so closely held to the
ego of the original creators.  I think that this is a great detriment
to the advancement of the frameworks themselves as well as the
usability of the language as a whole.  Perhaps a talk about
comperitive frameworks, a meeting of the creators of the various
frameworks to discuss "lesson's learned" and sharing (what a new
concept, especially for open source)...

----

The tutorials all started at ground zero, and went from there.  I
don't need an intro on most topics, I want to learn advanced features
of technologies I already work with.

----

I wish the talks were fewer but longer, more tutorial in nature.  Some
were very rushed.

----

I thought the tutorials were the most productive time I had at Pycon.
I would like to see more and, perhaps, even have some during the main
conference (with limited enrollment).  There were many sessions where
none of the talks appealed to me and I would have rather paid more to
take more tutorials.

----

It would have been nice to have an exhibit room for vendors, even a
small one. I liked the lightning talks. I liked the tables set up in
the main conf. Having wireless was great, not sure what could be done
to help the bandwidth without spending a ton of money. For some reason
the sound system kept getting worse in the main hall over the course
of conference not better. The feedback got to be really annoying and
loud at the end. All in all I thought it was a well organized
conference and I plan to attend next year. The price was very
reasonable.

----

The wireless networking coverage sucked. Unreliable, and frequently
unavailable.

----

Network was almost "non-existant".  I would refuse to pay them for the
service received!

Maybe having a sprinting area (in the staging room?) on tutorial day
would be good.  The space is already reserved.

It is still important to have both wired and wireless... especially
when the capabilities of the network staff are as limited as those
used by the Marriott Hotel used for PyCon 2006.

----

I attended the wxWidgets tutorial, and was slightly disappointed. Too
much time spent on basics (how an app interacts with window manager,
events, etc), and full specification of various widgets, and not
enough time spent on the key elements of GUI design (e.g. no mention
at all about MVC techniques). Even important things like sizers seemed
very rushed.

All the APs were on channel 1.

More infrastructure for people to coordinate out-of-conference
activities (dinners, drinking, hanging out with people doing
interesting things, etc). (I guess people *could have* created a wiki
page, but it wasn't clear that doing so would have been
acceptable/encouraged).

Other topics for next year (why do you limit us to only 3?):
"How to manage a 100,000+ line python application"
"Python for Security Practitioners" (I'll be submitting a talk proposal on this :-))
"State of Python Operating Systems" (e.g. unununium.org and cleese.sf.net)
"Guerilla's Guide to Getting Python into your Company"
PyGame (or python media/graphics in general)

----

My first PyCon.  Really enjoyed it.  Could be longer (1-2 days
longer).  Love the sprint concept.  Network needs to work better.

----

The rooms need more power strips! That would have helped my experience
immensely. In the main conference hall, there were power strips only
for about a third of the seats. That was unacceptable.

----

The tutorials were okay this year, however they could be much
better. The topics seemed a little broad for three hours.

----

I'm interested in _giving_ tutorials (again) next year. These answers
are based on if you decide not to ask me to return.

Another thought, and I'm not sure if this is a subject for a talk or a
tutorial, would be some 'live code' that uses some of the more
esoteric features of Python. (Metaclass functions, decorators, etc)
Rather than the contrived examples, I'd like to see situations where
these features solve a problem that can't easily be solved by other
means.

----

Many of the speakers seemed unprepared -- in some cases I really felt
like they were not being respectful of my time by just how poorly
prepared they were.  It was clear that many talks hadn't been
practiced (or cursorily if they were) -- I've been to many conferences
(and PyCon last year) and it felt like there was a substantial
difference this year as compared to years past.  I'm not sure what
could be done to remedy this, but something needs to be done.

The new tables/seating style was both good and bad -- I feel as though
it made it less lively because people were less inclined to pay
attention to the speakers because it was so much easier to have your
laptop out.

The hotel was far too isolated -- to get around one really needs a car
because the area is pedestrian unfriendly and the sidewalks that are
there are frequently topped by scores of birds on the powerlines
making it, um, an adventure in looking up and dodging while walking.
Amusing until they don't miss (trust me ;) So, either more frequent
shuttles (and better info on the surrounding area) are needed or a
less suburban location would be preferable.

For all of the bad stuff above, I really did enjoy the conference and
this year's venue felt much more fitting to the size of the PyCon
crowd than the D.C. location did.  Thanks to all the volunteers who
put in all of the hard work!!


----

-Wireless was *terrible*. I'm sure you're aware of it already. This
really needs to be fixed or next year may be my last PyCon. I usually
need to have access to my work while on travel and this is a must.

-Lunch was great, snacks--less so. Why was there no coffee *before*
the keynotes, which were 1 1/2 hours? I would be willing to spend an
extra $10 on registration to have coffee and breakfast foods available
before and after the keynote, but even just having them before would
be nice.

-It would be nice to know in advance what talks will be available
after the Con in audio/video. Several talks I wanted to see
overlapped, and it would be nice to know if one of them would be
available at a later date. Perhaps also leaving a couple slots open
for encore presentations if the presenters are interested (this
happened with Ian Bicking's eggs talk) 

----

This was my first PyCon and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It couldn't have
been much better (short of actually meeting Alex Martelli-but meeting
Anna Martelli Ravenscroft more than made up for that ;-))

----

The keynote talk on Plone was bad. It was like the speakers hadn't
prepared anything at all.

The talk by AG Interactive, Python in the Enterprise was embarassingly
bad. Essentially, they said "Python is great. We used python, but we
can't tell you anything else because it's proprietary."

Python for Series 60 was also too much advocacy and too little
technical detail.


----

The keynotes should not be tied to a particular product, IMO. Aside
from that problem, the Plone Keynote was terrible. The presenters may
have built a fine product, but they have no ability to talk about it
intelligently. The interview with Bram Cohen keynote wasn't much
better. Guido's keynote was great.

Some of the sessions were rather lame. If only there was a test for
presentation ability that presenters would have to pass to get a
slot. The PyGTK presentation for example, was just awful. It belonged
in a Open Space Talk, not a a talk with official billing. Perhaps all
presenters should show up a day early and spend a few hours with Kevin
Dangoor about how to present!

----

Tutorial proceedings were a great buy for $25, keep doing this (if
tutorial presenters will permit)

----

Were the tutorials intended for beginners?  IF so then that should be
clear.  Maybe the tutorial should have a "difficulty" rating.  We are
a rather experienced group of pythonistas so we didn't get lots out of
"Text and Data Processing", for example, but I got tons out of "Agile
development and testing"

I think talks and tutorials where they showed real world stuff was the
most helpful.  When the talks are generic they are light on content.
People start naming functions foo and bar, and it is hard to really
get into it.  But when people show real examples it is much better.

----

I'd attend a tutorial only if I were *really* interested in the topic.

----

It's hard to suggest topics for next year this far in advance since
it's hard to know what gaps I'd like to fill a year from now.

----

Overall, I had a good time. Had to leave the sprints early... wah.

Thought the hotel was so-so. I thought the "quiet" rooms should have been enforced.

----

I must say that the social/personal networking aspect of this
conferencce was unparalleled. Just fantastic. It was a HUGE success
having such great hotel rates that most everyone stayed under the same
roof.

As many have noted, the wireless network left a tremendous amount to
be desired. I was actually one of the lucky ones, and didn't have any
issues until the sprint days, the last few days of which the wireless
was just abysmally poor.

----

If tutorial costs are reasonable our management will pay for them.

----

The wireless access on the conference floor was pretty poor. I ended
up (in order to keep needed communications open) paying the hotel the
extra $10/night for a wired connection in my room.  I would rather
have kept my laptop with me.

Nice work, AMK and everybody else. It's still my favorite technical conference.

----

I attended the tutorials this year and found them helpful, but the
time went by quickly and there were more that I wanted to attend than
I had time for.  Next year perhaps having longer sessions (4 hours
perhaps) and maybe a second day of sessions would be great.

----

Badges should show nickname, company, and  city/country.

----

Put company names on name tags.

----

I'd like to learn to use a specific part of Python for applications on Linux, not just overviews of apps written in Python.

How can we improve PyCon next year?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The current location felt fairly isolated from the outside world -- I
would prefer a more urban location, however the hotel environment
worked much better than the previous DC location as far as feeling
spacious, connected.  The crowd flow felt smoother than in years past.

The food was good this year, but given the relative isolation of the
hotel from cheap breakfast options, a small breakfast offering every
day would be worth another $20 in registration fee to me but at the
least, coffee being available before the morning sessions start would
be huge.

Overall this has been a good experience and I want to thank all of the
volunteers that put it all together!

----

I heard several presenters declined. Make them a bit more special, by
destinguishing them on the nametag (use ''speaker' like at EuroPython,
it gets you the inquiries from what do you speak on from the girls,
that missed you presentation)

----

There is a huge, hard-to-cross gap between intro Python and advanced
usage. This applies to all sources of Python knowledge: books,
material available on the web, and this conference.

I would like to know more about advanced features of the language:
metaclasses, descriptors, decorators. I checked every Python book on
display at Nerdbooks last night, and found only one chapter in the
Python cookbook. And because that's a cookbook, it was pretty poor on
concepts.

There is a need for an advanced Python book, and it would be wonderful
if there were a concerted effort to improve coverage of these topics
at next year's pycon, perhaps at tutorials.

I have to say that this conference was somewhat disappointing -- I
came away knowing way too much about this year's fads (aka web
frameworks), without increasing my understanding of the language
itself.  

----

Better wireless which allows peer networking. Or else have ethernet
switches everywhere.

Get Alex Martelli, Bruce Eckel

Serve breakfast.

More volunteers for room setup night before.

Capture VGA signal going to projectors so we can have video + audio
recordings. 


----

Turn off the air condition...all rooms were too cold...colder
than outside.

----

coffee and tea available before keynotes!

----

better wireless

better way to know about schedule changes (maybe e-mail alerts)

have talk feedback forms available at start of conference so they can
be filled out right after each talk.


----

Better keynotes -- I wasn't impressed with the Plone one or the Cohen
one.  (Although the interview format was an interesting experiment, I
don't think it worked.)

I did like the "bonus lunch keynote" on Friday.

Food was excellent overall.  No complaints there.

----

I believe it's been covered above.

----

Review the talks more, perhaps work with the presenters in advance to
ensure a smooth process and optimal experience.

----

More repeats of the good talks.  Repeat highly rated talks on
subsequent days during openspace

----

The "snack" breaks wiped the food out... and if the session you
attended went long, you just went hungry.

Publicize wired networking... some of us are still in the dark
ages. ;)

The schedule of talks had too much churn, especially on Sunday; I
understand that people back out, but it made it hard to plan where you
were going.

The nerdbooks.com party was a great way to meet people; more of that
would be good.

The lightning talks were good... a couple of flops, a few homeruns,
but overall pretty good.

Needed better moderation of speakers going until the start of the next
timeslot, particularly in the open space talks.

Encourage "main" speakers to also hold an open space Q&A/BoF sometime
later on during the conference.

----

There's no place for general comments, so I'll do that here.

I didn't use the network, so no comments.

I thought the food was very good.  The catering staff was really the
best I've ever seen.  Very helpful, and didn't mind interacting with
attendees.  That's unusual.

----

* The wireless BITES!  Extremely annoying.  

* A better mechanism for impromtu announcements, similar to the
* bulletin board sheets of years past, with scribblings of all sorts:
* GPG key signings, BOF's, "Joe meet me at 8:00", etc.

* Food was pretty good.

* Comraderie is, as always, excellent.  I'm participating in my first
* sprint, though I'm leaving Tuesday.  I feel completely out of my
* element, but folks are very tolerant of my slow nature.

* Nothing you can do about this, but I was surprised by Andrew's
* comments that most found the beds comfy.  I wanted to add another
* data point: I found lying in the bed to be akin to drowning, and
* keep wishing for a much firmer mattress.  I usually find hotel beds
* to be pretty firm and have been sleeping horribly here. (That, and
* the thermostat has been set to 80 F for four days and the room is
* still cold.  The thermostat is making something blow, but it ain't
* heat.  It's not AC either.  Seems to be just air.)


----

We need to get more volunters involved.  There were a handful of
people working the registration desk and hosting sessions.

Serving food in the hallway made tigs quite crowded.  Is there a way
to solve that?

It would be nice to have more tee shirts available.  Perhaps we could
allow people to order extra when they register?  Also, we need to have
a way to match up the size they ordered at registration so that we do
not run out of specific sizes.  This could be as easy as having a list
of the registrants avail able to check off as they register.

Perhaps more organized evening activities?  Professional sports or a
shuttle running to the Galaria.

Pycon is a great time and I would like to help more for Pycon 2007.  Please make your needs known earlier.  I was on the volunteer mailing list but felt that there must have been another form of communication because often we would just see what had been done; not very often was a task thown out for someone to pick up.

----

More tutorials, better wireless, some new social networking gimic

----

My only real complaint is about the cleanliness of the ballroom. I
think the lack of convienient trash cans (particularly at the
beginning of the conference) contributed to the problem. And with as
many soda can's that are emptied during the conference, the trash
recepticals should be paired with clearly marked recycle containers
too. I'm not normally a neat freak, but it kind of bothered me this
week.  

----

Please provide coffee during registration not just at first break. the
hallways were a bit crowded during the lunch breaks. I'm not sure how
that could be made better though. It worked though. The lunch choices
were excellent. some of the afternoon snacks were kind of odd like the
trail mix.

----

More of everything! Free student places? Competitions, prizes. How
about an "installfest"?

----

Better network access - when the network was up, it was fast enough
but wireless APs got knocked out by the door motors in the ballroom,
and signal strenghts fluctuated a lot.

----

Not as many "intro" talks. Maybe intro + usage/example code would be
better? I already knew a lot about the topics before so I'd rather get
into the heart of things.

Would be nice to have coffee available before the keynotes!

----

I expanded my thoughts in general in my blog,
http://pyjesse.blogspot.com/2006/02/pycon-my-critique.html - and I
come off as overly critical, but I would like to take some time and
take a more proactive role in improving the conference as much as I
can.

I believe that as a language conference, we can not concentrate on the
"hype du-jour" of the day - while that does help recent adoption, I
think we need to cover our "core" bases as well. I think we need to go
back to systems/program design, and showcasing the core feature of the
language.

We can not simply show those successful applications written with the
language - we have to show people how to make those successful
applications and tools.

For instance, TurboGears is really cool - and a lot of the web
frameworks get a lot of soundbites, but how do I, as someone knowing
the core language build something like that?

----

 * Have breakfast before the keynotes so people can be encouraged to
 * mingle in the mornings too.

 * Make sure the mics are working for people to ask questions

 * seamless wifi access

Otherwise I had a great time and will be back next year for sure!!!  Good job to all involved.

----

Since it will be at the same venue...

MAKE SURE THAT THE HOTEL UNDERSTANDS THAT THEIR NETWORK SERVICES WERE
A DISASTER!!

They should be completely embarrassed.

If we paid for all of the food/drinks that were set out... then IMO they were far to quick to take things away.  Some of us were busy and didn't get to the lines until stuff was being taken away.

For next year, at the end if the serving time, consolidate items to
the one side (between the registration desk and the kitchen and leave
it up until it is clear that all are done).  

----

More Talks on WxPython

----

I had 4 coworkers who expressed a desire to go to the conference (and
had management approval) but ended up not going due to spanning over
the weekend (family events interfered). I'm sure for everyone of those
types of situations, you'd be hurting someone who didn't have
management approval and wouldn't be able to attend if it meant taking
off of work though.

----

Work out network issues.  Maybe stretch out conference to allow longer
talks + more time between talks.

----

Publish speaker slides and notes before conference if possible.

Shuttle to and from airport.

----

email receipt need to list the tutorials you signed up for. 

Descriptions of talks  need to be available earlier (same for tutorials). 

I think the time for individual talks were way too short. Every one of them ended up having to be cut short. Consider adding 5 minutes to each talk. 

BTW, the tutorials were great! David Goodger was great! 

----

Less talks but longer higher quality sessions. 30 minute sessions are
too short. Be more critical on who you take for talks. You should have
a good idea of who the good speakers are. Dump talks that are very
abstract like "Vertical Fractal Analysis".

Perhaps you can have two levels of talks. Better speakers with more
popular topics can get 45 to 60 minutes. Lump others into open space
talks of 15 - 30 minutes.

----

A comment on that last question - I was one of those who originally
objected to the weekend format. I've now changed my mind. In a couple
different ways, the weekend structure worked out a lot better for me
personally.

----

Coffee and/or breakfast in the early AM would be hugely helpful.  I'd
gladly pay more for this addition if cost is an issue.

----

Tell people to prepare more engaging presentations and tell them to
rehearse to co-workers several times in advance.

----

See "Other comments" above. In summary: 
-fix the wireless ASAP
-coffee first thing
-have a schedule of talks whose audio/video will be available post-Con

----

I felt that the keynotes were weak, especially the interview.  I felt
that the entire conference was a little thin on technical details, and
that it would be much better to have half as many talks that were
twice as long, or at least one track of talks that were focused on
providing more detail.

A lot of times, I went to a presentation to only come out of it with
an idea of what something does, not how to do it.  I can get this
information from the project's website.  In my mind, some more
detailed technical howto sessions and best-practices sessions would be
great.

I would also like to see this extended into having a "track" of talks
in multiple parts, to replace the concept of tutorials.  So, maybe
three sessions on TurboGears, in ascending order of detail (general
overview, intermediate level implementation, advanced stuff).

Far and away the biggest advantage of being at PyCon was meeting
people, and sharing ideas.  There should be more facilitating of this.

----

More code and demos, fewer slide/informational talks. I also found
that I began to look for good speakers, and the topic almost doesn't
matter. It's harder to deal with that when deciding which talks to
allow of course.

More smaller spaces for folks to sprint during the conference might be
nice too. This was my first pycon, and the number of people I met
really surprised me. The Python community is very friendly, and the
more we can do to promote the social aspect (as geeks and people) I
think the better the conference would be.

I'd hate to see a sign-up for a talk form, but something like the
party interest form for talks so we don't have what happened with the
Python Eggs talk (which really turned out not to be about eggs).

You already know about the wireless, but if you could have someway of
folding in-room internet into the special room rate for pycon it might
be at least a good option for next year.

----

These are more just general comments rather than specific improvement
suggestions.

Wireless coverage was horrible.  We could have probably done a better
job ourselves by buying 10 WAPs and sprinkling them liberally around.

I only attended Guido's keynote, the other topics didn't really
interest me.

If a speaker is going to code, make sure the text is readable on
screen or provide handouts or have a follow along website. (not
specific to pycon but to a speaker)


----

Promote it more heavily and starting earlier. The more attendees there
are, the more valuable the conference is, since we learn so much from
each other.

----

1. Have more social activities - may be a visit to a Dave and Busters or similar, if logistically possible.
2. This time, the trail mix supplied on the first day of the conference (snack time) was stale.

----

I was disappointed at the quality of the talks. I think the bar for
doing a talk should be raised, even if that means there are less
talks.

In addition, perhaps people should be encouraged to organize workshops
or other interactive activities.

----

The keynote speakers should not be 'selling' a product, telling us
it's a great way to get a consulting gig. That's not about Python. The
keynotes should be about Python. I would like to see some kind of
filter for the talks.  Several of the talks were of such low quality
that I felt dumber for having attended!

----

Everything was pretty much ok.

Presenter access to internet during presentations really helped in live demos.

Encourage presenters to do at least a little live demo at the Python prompt.

----

- add country/state to name tags
- provide wired tcp/ip access for speakers
- add a survey before conference to find hot topics and try to put those talks in large rooms.
- provide a message board for posting of adhoc meetings (like dinner groups)

----

Include more general talks. The talks this year seemed to be intensely
focused on particular niches of Python, but there wasn't much for
general Python coding practices.  

----

Somehow getting Internet access in the rooms enabled as part of the
group-rate would be excellent.

It would be nice if there was a feature on the website to allow people
to publish some info about themselves, a picture, maybe a paragraph
listing some interests, and most importantly a URL to an RSS feed
(hopefully Python-related).  Then have the website do some
feed-aggregation, to have a sort of Planet-Pycon, so that in the
months leading up to the conference (and even afterwards) you could
get to know the people you'll be crossing paths with.
   
Thanks for the conference

----

BOTTLED WATER!!!  The water was undrinkable, so I drank pop.  More
healthy snacks (pronounced lower-carb ;-).  I gained 10 pounds in a
week! :-((

Maybe something like a Linux install fest.  Where people can try to
get things running on their laptops.  Things like setting up buildbot
or selenium or implementing a simple CherryPy/Django server.  The
tutorials and talks were mostly lecture, it might be useful to have
labs.  I realize that labs can take a lot of time and effort but it
might be useful.  Maybe Saturday evening could be labs.

----

i think one good idea would be to add IRC nicks to the conf badge.
there are a lot of people i talk to on IRC and don't neccesarily know
their real name.  an option to add this upon registration would be a
neat idea.

better network.  i'm sure you are going to get a lot of that ;)

session management was a little flaky.  i was in a couple talks that
ran over and i missed the start of the next talk.  i noticed steve
holden did a nice job of this.  he was very adamant that the talks
ended when they were supposed to.

----

Have three Lightning Talk sessions, one per day.  We had two sessions
with 20 speakers, but there were easily 30 speakers available, if not
more.  Every PyCon has had more speakers than time, and the audience
does not get bored.  Let's find the saturation point.  Only the first
needs to be plenary; the second fit into a regular (largish) session
room.

Bring back the bulletin board for Open Space.  The computer-based
scheduling allowed only one topic per timeslot and described them all
as "talks".  Open Space became an overflow for session talks.  That's
important but it misses something that made the DC Open Spaces such a
success: several simultaneous roundtable discussions.I wanted to do a
Cheetah roundtable but all the timeslots were filled with "talks".  I
could have pushed but it didn't seem worth the bother.

The Marriott's additional space and layout was definitely an
improvement over last year, and the hotel rooms were quite a bargain.
The only thing I missed space-wise was a full-size ballroom with round
tables for the Open Space.

We should make sure the schedule is clearer when unexpected things
happen.  The first day, the lunch talk started late and ended late.
People were confused all afternoon whether all the sessions were moved
back or the after-lunch session squashed.  Some people thought one,
some the other.  So you'd go to a talk and the previous one was still
going on, and small talks (Open Space) didn't know when to begin.
When something like this happens, we need to adjust the times on all
the posted schedule sheets and make an announcement.

The evening party at Nerdbooks was great.  I was impressed with the
amount and variety of food they contributed, and it gave people a
chance to browse/buy technical references.  Better than just selling a
few titles at the conference.

I felt a bit isolated from Dallas.  Maybe we can have an excursion
downtown the day before or after, or something.

----

[This is one feedback submitted as two entries, because the software submitted it while I was in the middle of typing.]

----

Improve the quality of the talks.. breadth and depth.

----

The technical aspects of the talks seemed to be different this year,
perhaps with a target audience of beginner to intermediate skill
level.

It would be really nice to have more advanced talks next year, perhaps
with "Advaned Topic" prepended to the talk title, to give beginners a
heads-up.

Have Sean Reifschneider/tummy.com do the networking ;-)

----

WIRELESS:
very spotty this year--up and down all the time, lots of dropped
packets.  I don't mind if it's a little slow, as long as it is up
consistently.

FOOD:
Please provide continental breakfast a la PyCon 2005.  I thought that
was a great way to get people there early and is very convenient for
attendees.  Food was better at PyCon 05 than 06.  This year the snacks
were not up to par. Preferred 05 where there was fresh fruit and baked
goods at snacks.  This year we got bagels once or twice, but the
oatmeal bars and a nuts-only snack don't cut it.  Lunches were OK.  

----

better wireless, it's great otherwise.

----

Offer transportation for evening meals each night.  There were several
evenings where a group would get together and go out for dinner, which
is fine, but many people did not have rental cars or transportation
which limited dining options.  It would be nice to have some type of
shuttle or car pool available each night to a central location with
dining options for those who have no transportation and do not want to
eat at the hotel every night. 

The internet connectivity was very lacking as well.  Granted, the
hotel is probably not used to having 400 geeks hammering their network
all weekend long, but perhaps next year they can offer a better
service for the conference.  There were many issues with limited
connectivity to the wireless network and very slow speeds.  The
in-room connections which were not free also had connectivity and
speed issues.  If the hotel wants to keep the conference they really
should address this issue next year.

----

Better and more snacks.

----

Plone keynote was awful.  After the talk I had no idea  what it was,
what it did, what it looked like, how it works, what its relation to
Zope is, etc. 

Microphones that don't work are unacceptable.

Slides that have very small fonts are unacceptable.

----

Somewhere that's more of a walking city would be better (even San Antonio).

There seem to be more people developing the Python language than
working on applications. 

----

Don't let the Plone guys keynote ever again.

Longer time slots for presentations so it doesn't feel so rushed and
there is time for questions. 

More emphasis on working code demonstrations.

Fix the audio.  Even in small rooms you could not hear the speaker.

----

Improve the sound capabilities.

----

Dallas is boring.  I'll wait until 2008 when we hopefully find a
better host city. 

Have an organized Friday evening party or social activity.  OSCON has
lots of events with free beer, which really help the shy to connect
with others. 

----

Less web development, more Linux apps.

Put on the web site "computer recommended".

The conference was more of a technology fair and not what I expected.
More of an overview of products available.
