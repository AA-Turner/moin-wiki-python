= Google's Summer of Code =

Google's Summer of Code initiative, which funded students to work on free software,

= Python AST BOF =

The Python bytecode compiler will sport a new abstract syntax in Python 2.5.  The
AST will provide an interface between the interpreter and Python programs, which
can inspect or modify the AST.  The purpose of the BOF is to discuss uses of the
AST and to define APIs for sharing the AST between Python and C.
