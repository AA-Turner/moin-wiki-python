= Listing of Handheld Web Browser User Agent Strings =

There will be many people using handheld devices at the convention (myself included). In order to make their lives easier, we would like to see more of our web pages be friendly to such devices. The problem is detecting those devices. There are a number of browsers for handheld devices and no good list of User Agent strings for detecting them on the server side. 

There is the 'media="handheld"' css link specifier, but the only browser which supports this is Opera.

To find the User Agent string for your browser, go to the [http://web-sniffer.net/ web-sniffer] site.
