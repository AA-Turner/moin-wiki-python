Some possible sites: 

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (really!)
http://www.conferencesolution.com/ (Arlington, up to 750)

Marymount U.: http://www.marymount.edu/confcenter/main.html (Arlington, up
to 750, but only available from May to August 1st),

DoubleTree Tysons Corner:
http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=IADLRDT (largest
room is 600; calls itself "executive", so probably pricy).

4H Center, Chevy Chase, Maryland
http://www.4hcenter.org/index.html (up to 800, but specializing in youth
conferences; has 800 beds available, though)

Hilton Mark Center, Alexandria 
http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DCAAHHH (largest room
seats 1200; this is where Python10 was held; forget about mass transit,
though).
