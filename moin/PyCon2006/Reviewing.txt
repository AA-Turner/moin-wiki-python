This page explains how to review proposals for PyCon.

Each proposal is randomly assigned three reviewers when it's
submitted.  However, those assignments are just suggestions: you don't
have to review all the papers you're assigned, and 
you might not be able to review them because of a conflict of interest,
not being competent in the field, etc..  Therefore, you can review proposals that
aren't assigned to you.  As long as every proposal gets three reviews
from three different people, we're happy.

Once submission is closed and all the proposals have three reviews, we
make the accept/reject decisions.  Last year we did this in a 2- or
3-hour IRC session where perhaps half the committee was present.

Reviewers vote +1, -1, +0, -0.  Proposals that get only +1, or +1 with a
+0, are usually accepted with little discussion.  Papers that get only -1 or -0s
usually get rejected.  The bulk of the IRC discussion was about papers
with mixed reviews.  Another IRC session a few days later was used to
assemble the scheduling, which was done outside the proposal system.
(AMK wants to add scheduling to the proposal system this year... not a
pressing need right now, though.)

The general process came from the paper at
