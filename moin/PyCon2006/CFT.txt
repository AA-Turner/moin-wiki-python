PyCon 2006 Call for Tutorials
------------------------------------------

Have experience teaching classes or tutorials? PyCon 2006 is looking for proposals to fill a pre-conference tutorials day.  PyCon 2006 will be held February 24-26 in Addison, Texas (near Dallas).  Tutorials will be held on February 23, at the same location.

Tutorial sessions will be a half day (3 hours, with a 15-minute break); presenters may request two sessions in order to make up a full day.  Providing take-home materials for attendees is encouraged, and tutorial presenters will receive compensation for each attendee who elects to attend their session.  Tutorials may be on any topic, but obviously should be instructional in nature.

Extra consideration will be given to presenters with prior experience teaching classes or giving conference tutorials. Please provide one reference or evidence of such prior experience (sessions taught at OSCON, EuroPython, local user groups, etc.).

PyCon attendees will register for tutorials.  We reserve the right to cancel tutorials with low attendance; presenters will not be paid for cancelled tutorials.  

Example tutorial topics can be found at: http://us.pycon.org/TX2006/Tutorials

Important Dates
=============

* Submission deadline: November 15, 2005
* Acceptance deadline: November 22, 2005
* Cancellation date: January 15, 2006  (for inadequate attendance)
