PyCon 2006 Call for Tutorials
------------------------------------------

Have experience teaching classes or tutorials? PyCon 2006 is looking for proposals to fill a pre-conference tutorials day.  PyCon 2006 will be held February 24-26 in Addison, Texas (near Dallas).  Tutorials will be held on Februrary 23, at the same location.

Tutorial sessions will be a half day, although presenters may ask for a full day (sufficient justification will be required).  Presenters should have prior experience teaching classes or giving conference presentations, and are required to provide at least one reference (sessions taught at OSCON, PyCon, etc.).  Providing take-home materials for attendees is encouraged, and tutorial presenters will receive compensation for each attendee who elects to attend their session.  Tutorials may be on any topic, but obviously should be instructional in nature.

=============

* Submission deadline: November 15, 2005
* Acceptance deadline: November 22, 2005

 * Summary of proposed presentation
