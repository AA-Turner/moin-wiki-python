== Overview ==

Each web framework has it's stregnths and weaknesses. 
The collaborative nature of Wiki's and the minimal change management provided is essential to organizing the convention.
The power of Zope to provide long term change management of conference materials and media is essential.
The ability to rapidly develop complex data driven applications with Django has proven invaluable.

How do we get these four drasticly different frameworks to behave together?

Django seems to be unlikely solution.

 * Django can be seen as a toolkit in which features can be used independently to glue the rest of the world together.
 * Django can access any other python module including Zope modules, Zope DB, and even PHP templates.
 * Django can be used to generate php files, or it can use php output as its template input.

The current Django applications written for the convention are integrated into the site using such features.
