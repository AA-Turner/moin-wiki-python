=== ConText ===
I use a freeware text editor called ConText (for windoze only I'm afraid) from http://www.fixedsys.com/context/.

It includes language highlighters for a lot of languages including python.  It also allows customisation to execute a command using the loaded files (e.g. execute the loaded python script) then capture the output and decod the line numbers where the problem occurred.

=== jEdit ===
A nice Swing based editor for many languages and Java specially. You can add additional plugins like PyUtil and Jython for your Python work. Get it from http://jedit.org

=== Gnu Emacs ===

GnuEmacs is the editor of the gods (XEmacs even more so - it ships with PythonMode as a default). Does everything (almost) that you could want it to. PythonMode is very useful.

=== SciTE ===

SciTE is based on SCIntilla editor engine. Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for building and running programs. Plug-in suport for Python API (there is script which create description of all Python API on your computer), the best syntax highlighting, work on Linux, Solaris, Win family.
Get it from http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html
