=== ConText ===
I use a freeware text editor called ConText (for windoze only I'm afraid) from http://www.fixedsys.com/context/.

It includes language highlighters for a lot of languages including python.  It also allows customisation to execute a command using the loaded files (e.g. execute the loaded python script) then capture the output and decod the line numbers where the problem occurred.

=== jEdit ===
A nice Swing based editor for many languages and Java specially. You can add additional plugins like PyUtil and Jython for your Python work. Get it from http://jedit.org
