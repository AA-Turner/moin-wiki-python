Whether you want to quickly edit Python source code, write or debug whole Python programs, or use Python in  IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments, you have a pleasantly wide range of choices.

If you have anything to contribute -- e.g. configurations for editors, new editors, or opinion -- don't hesitate to edit or create pages.

There's an EditorConfigurationHowto available.

(!) Please keep wiki links as wiki links, use external links only if there is no existing page for the editor. Please add pages like BoaConstructor also to page IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments.
