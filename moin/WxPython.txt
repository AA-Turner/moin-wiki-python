wxPython is a blending of the WxWidgets (formerly WxWindows) class library for C++ and Python. wxPython can be found at (surprise!) http://www.wxpython.org/ and it has its own wiki there: http://wiki.wxpython.org/



MythDebunking: ''WxPython is hard to install on Unix. You need the right versions of GTK, WxWidgets and WxPython.''

Also check the WxDesigner and BoaConstructor.
