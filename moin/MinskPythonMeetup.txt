Python Meetup in Minsk is a monthly event usually held at the last Friday in some club at the center of the city. It is organized with the help of local companies, who do this as a service of gratitude to the open source and Python community. It is an informal event, but time limits and central placement in club makes it less of meetup, and more like usual talks and questions session. Anyway, any help to make the event more informal and fun seems to be very appreciated.

Topics covered so far are in Russian and cover a wide range of talks - from simple to strictly hardc0re. There is a lack of basic level talks, so they are the most welcome.


Next Python Meetup will be on 29th of November 2013.
