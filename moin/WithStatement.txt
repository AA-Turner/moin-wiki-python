This page is dedicated to the public discussion of [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0343.html PEP 343]: Anonymous Block Redux and Generator Enhancements.

I think this is a good one; I hope people agree. Its acceptance will
obsolete about 4 other PEPs! (A sign that it fulfills a need and that
the proposed solution is powerful.)

Please read the PEP; then add your comments here.  Please sign your comments with your name.
