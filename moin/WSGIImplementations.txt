= Implementations of the Web Server Gateway Interface =

Note: many of these implementations may be partial/incomplete or noncompliant as of the current draft spec.  If you can't get the code samples in the spec to work with one of these implementations, there's a good chance that the implementation is broken: contact the implementation's author.

== Web Server implementations ==

 * [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-October/000956.html wsgiref] - a library of base classes covering most of the "hard parts" of a WSGI server implementation, written by the PEP author.  It also includes utility functions and classes that may be useful for application/framework implementors, and should be considered a "must read" for server implementors.  (Update: most of the limitations mentioned in the linked post have now been resolved; wsgiref now includes sensible default error handling and logging, automatic calculation of Content-Length when possible, and greater test coverage.)

 * [http://www.xhaus.com/modjy modjy] - a WSGI implementation for Jython

 * see Jonpy below

 * see WSGIUtils below

 * [http://st0rm.hopto.org/wsgi/ Twisted] (If the server isn't working, there's a copy [http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGIKit/wsgikit/twisted_wsgi.py here])

 * [http://www.idyll.org/~t/www-tools/wsgi/] - SWAP, a WSGI adapter for [http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/ SCGI].

 * [http://pyds.muensterland.org/wiki/toolserver.html Toolserver Framework for Python] - a WSGI implementation in a Medusa-based webservice framework

== Web Framework implementations ==

 * [http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGIKit WSGIKit] - a [http://w4py.org Webware] reimplementation, implemented with a degree of framework-neutrality in mind.

 * [http://st0rm.hopto.org/wsgi/ Jonpy] - this also includes a HTTP server with a WSGI backend

 * Nevow -  in a branch of its Subversion repository.  (Can someone supply a link to this?)

 * [http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/ WSGIUtils] - A multi-threaded WSGI server implementation and a simple framework providing basic user authentication, signed cookies, and persistent sessions.

 * [http://www.idyll.org/~t/www-tools/wsgi/] - QWIP, a WSGI adapter for [http://quixote.ca/ Quixote] applications.

 * [http://st0rm.hopto.org/subway.zip Subway] - early work on a [http://rubyonrails.org Rails]-like system.
