= Implementations of the Web Server Gateway Interface =

Note: many of these implementations may be partial/incomplete or noncompliant as of the current draft spec.  If you can't get the code samples in the spec to work with one of these implementations, there's a good chance that the implementation is broken: contact the implementation's author.

See [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html PEP 333] for more information on WSGI.

== Web Server implementations ==

 * [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2004-October/000956.html wsgiref] - a library of base classes covering most of the "hard parts" of a WSGI server implementation, written by the PEP author.  It also includes utility functions and classes that may be useful for application/framework implementors, and should be considered a "must read" for server implementors.  (Update: most of the limitations mentioned in the linked post have now been resolved; wsgiref now includes sensible default error handling and logging, automatic calculation of Content-Length when possible, and greater test coverage. See [http://svn.eby-sarna.com/wsgiref wsgiref] for source code.)
