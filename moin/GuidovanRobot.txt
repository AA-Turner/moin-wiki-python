Guido van Robot (http://gvr.sf.net) is a teaching language designed to introduce new programmers
to fundamental programming concepts.  This sprint is being organized primarily to introduce the
next generation of gvr hackers to the code and have them leave familiar enough with it to maintain
and add to it in the future.

The current list of participants includes:

  * Paul Carduner - coach and project leader
  * Eldar Omuraliev
