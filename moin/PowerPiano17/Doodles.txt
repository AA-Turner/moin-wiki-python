Sometimes, it doesn't hurt to play around with programming languages.  Python is probably the easiest and most enjoyable language to play around with, so I decided to create this section devoted to playing.  Feel free to write a program, edit an existing one, delete an existing one, etc.  It's like having an open source python-only playground!  Attachments are available for these little code "doodles," but please don't forget to update the attachments page if you make any changes here.
= Doodle #1 =
{{{#A doodle that tells the user what version of Windows they are using, the version, CSD level, and processor configuration.  It gives the
#win32_ver function of the platform module a nice output engine.

from platform import win32_ver

SystemInformation = win32_ver(release='', version='', csd='', ptype='')
print 'Opperating System: Microsoft Windows', SystemInformation[0]
print 'Version:', SystemInformation[1]
print 'CSD:', SystemInformation[2]
print 'Processor Configuration:', SystemInformation[3]
print
raw_input('Press Enter to quit. ')}}}
