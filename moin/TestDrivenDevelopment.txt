== Overview ==

'''Test Driven Development''' (TDD) is a method of designing software.

It goes roughly as follows: write your tests for the code ''before'' you write the code itself.

Why do it the "non-natural" way, then? Well, there are some benefits and very few - if any - drawbacks:

 * Coding tests means you have to call your non-existing code with all the parameters thus      forcing you to think how your library should work, thus it fixes the ["Signature"] of your code
 * You realize many errors in the code before you even wrote it, especially design-related errors
 * You will get better estimate how long coding will take

It is very important to emphasize TDD is ''not'' a testing methodology; it is a ''design'' methodology.
