In the four days before the conference the [http://codespeak.net/pypy PyPy] team hosts a sprint on their new Python-in-Python implementation. Until December 2006 the project aims to produce an MIT/BSD-licensed stackless version of Python with a JIT-compiler and new levels of flexibility and extensibility at the core interpreter and object implementation level.  Recently the project was granted EU-funding for their research and implementation plans. Armin Rigo and Holger Krekel will also give talks about PyPy and the separate [http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html py.test] tool (used to perform the various kinds of testing in PyPy) during the conference. 

The sprint is going to focus on reaching compatibility with CPython (currently we target version 2.3.4) for our PyPy version running on top of CPython.  One goal of the sprint is to pass 60% of the unmodified regression tests of mainline CPython. (We may modify that number depending on our progress before the sprint :-). It will thus be a great way to get to know CPython and PyPy better at the same time! Other possible work areas include: 

 * translation to C to get a first working lower-level representation of the interpreter 

 * integrating and implementing a full parser/compiler chain written in Python maybe already targetting the new AST-branch of mainline CPython 

 * fixing various remaining issues that will come up while trying to reach the compatibility goal

If you have other interests feel free to suggest different sprint topics! 
Besides core developers Bea DÃ¼ring, our "process manager" will be present to help improving and document our sprint and agile development process. 

We are going to give tutorials about PyPy's basic concepts and provide help to newcomers usually by pairing them with experienced pypythonistas. However, we ask newcomers to be present on the first day's morning (19th of March) of the sprint to be able to get everyone a smooth start into the sprint. So far most newcomers had few problems in getting a good start into our codebase. However, it is good to have the following preparational points in mind: 

 * experience programming in the Python language and interest to dive deeper 

 * subscription to [http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev pypy-dev] and  [http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-sprint pypy-sprint].  

 * have a subversion-client, Pygame and graphviz installed on the machine you bring to the sprint.

 * have a look at our current [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/ documentation], especially the [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/architecture architecture] and [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/howtopypy getting-started] documents. 

The pypy-dev and pypy-sprint lists are also the contact points for raising questions and suggesting and discussing sprint topics beforehand.  We are also on #pypy on freenode most of the time. Please don't hesitate to contact us or introduce yourself, your background and your interests at pypy-sprint!
