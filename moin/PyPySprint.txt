== PyPy Sprint ==

In the four days from 19th March till 22th March (inclusive)
the PyPy team will host a sprint on their new Python-in-Python
implementation.   The PyPy project was granted funding by the
European Union as part of its Sixth Framework Program,
and is now on track to produce a stackless Python-in-Python
Just-in-Time Compiler by December 2006.  Our Python
implementation, released under the MIT/BSD license, already
provides new levels of flexibility and extensibility at the
core interpreter and object implementation level.

Armin Rigo and Holger Krekel will also give talks about PyPy
and the separate  py.test tool (used to perform various kinds
of testing in PyPy) during the conference.

Naturally, we are eager to see how the other re-implementation
of Python, namely IronPython, is doing and to explore
collaboration possibilities.  Of course, that will depend on
the degree of openness that Microsoft wants to employ.

The Pycon2005 sprint is going to focus on reaching
compatibility with CPython (currently we target version 2.3.4)
for our PyPy version running on top of CPython. One goal of
the sprint is to pass 60% or more of the unmodified regression
tests of mainline CPython.  It will thus be a great way to get
to know CPython and PyPy better at the same time!  Other
possible work areas include:


 * translation to C to get a first working lower-level representation of the interpreter "specified in Python"

 * integrating and implementing a full parser/compiler chain written in Python perhaps already targetting the new AST-branch of mainline CPython 

 * fixing various remaining issues that will come up while trying to reach the compatibility goal 

 * integrating or coding pure python implementations of some Python modules which are currently written in C.

 * whatever issues you come up with! (but please tell us before hand so we can better plan introductions etc.)


If you have other interests feel free to suggest different sprint topics! 
Besides core developers Bea Düring, our "process manager" will be present to help improving and document our sprint and agile development process. 

We are going to give tutorials about PyPy's basic concepts and provide help to newcomers usually by pairing them with experienced pypythonistas.   However, we kindly ask newcomers to
be present on the first day's morning (19th of March) of the
sprint to be able to give everyone a smooth start into the
sprint. So far most newcomers have had few problems in getting a
good start into our codebase.  However, it is good to have the
following preparational points in mind:

 * experience programming in the Python language and interest to dive deeper 

 * subscription to [http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev pypy-dev] and  [http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-sprint pypy-sprint].  

 * have a subversion-client, Pygame and graphviz installed on the machine you bring to the sprint.

 * have a look at our current [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/ documentation], especially the [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/architecture architecture] and [http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/howtopypy getting-started] documents. 

The pypy-dev and pypy-sprint lists are also the contact points for raising questions and suggesting and discussing sprint topics beforehand.  We are also on #pypy on freenode most of the time. Please don't hesitate to contact us or introduce yourself, your background and your interests!
