= Matplotlib Sprint =

We'll be doing a sprint starting around 10AM on matplotlib.  There aren't a fixed set of topics yet, but please joing a discussion on matplotlib-users or matplotlib-devel if you have some specific ideas, or just add it to the wiki.

We have a list of official goals at http://matplotlib.sf.net/goals.html page and we could try to pick 
off as many of these as possible.  Here are some things of particular interest to me (John Hunter)

Topic ideas

  * contribute to the user's guide

  * support arbitrary clipping paths

  * gradient fills for polygons

  * provide mathtext fonts that don't have the licensing restrictions
    of bakoma, eg the umbellek fonts

  * unicode support / internationalization
 
  * expose latex/tex when available for mathtext rendering

  * expose agg drawing primitives (paths, etc) directly.  

  * mapping and projection utilities

  * pygtk/matplotlib/ipython integration: build a gtk widget to embed as a shell in gtk apps
     * bonus marks, do it in a way that is backend independent.

  * add your favorite plot type!
