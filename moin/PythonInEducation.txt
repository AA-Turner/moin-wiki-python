This is a listing of schools that are using Python in their curriculum.

I would like to confirm each of the schools below by linking to a specific web page with a course listing and/or the professor(s) teaching classes that involve the use of Python. Each listing should be expanded with a description of how Python is being used. -- KevinAltis

Need to copy info from:
 * http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/pyBiblio/schools.php

= High Schools =

 * Yorktown High School, in Arlington Virginia ([http://www.elkner.net/ Jeff Elkner])

= Colleges and Universities =

== Australia ==

 * University of New South Wales
  * Computer science taught/teaches course(s) with Python (as of about 2001)

== Canada ==

 * University of Waterloo
  * One of the more prestigious engineering/comp-sci schools in Canada is using it officially in [http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/ CS488 (Intro to 3D graphics)], and I'm told there's lots of use among faculty, staff and students.  I don't think they actually teach much Python, they're focused on teaching OpenGL/graphics programming, but they do wind up using it as the framework into which the students slot their code.

== United Kingdom ==

 * University of Oxford
  * Department of Physics (need to confirm)
