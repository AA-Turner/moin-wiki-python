This is a listing of schools that are using Python in their curriculum.

I would like to confirm each of the schools below by linking to a specific web page with a course listing and/or the professor(s) teaching classes that involve the use of Python. Each listing should be expanded with a description of how Python is being used. -- KevinAltis

== Canada ==

 * University of Waterloo - One of the more prestigious engineering/comp-sci schools in Canada is using it officially in [http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/ CS488 (Intro to 3D graphics)], and I'm told there's lots of use among faculty, staff and students.  I don't think they actually teach much Python, they're focused on teaching OpenGL/graphics programming, but they do wind up using it as the framework into which the students slot their code.
