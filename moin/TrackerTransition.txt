= What =

To finally get us off of SF and on to Roundup!


= When =

XXX a reasonable amount of time after Python 2.5.1 is released.


= Who =

* Brett Cannon (PST)


= Where =

XXX IRC or Google Talk/Jabber chat room.


= How =

 1. Announce upcoming switch on python-dev, encourage people to comment.

 1. Wait two weeks.

 1. Put warning into current installation that it is no longer live.

 1. Set DNS for bugs.python.org to roundup tracker.

 1. Activate mail sending to python-bugs-list, and activate sending of weekly summaries.

 1. Turn off Roundup tracker and wipe it (XXX static page or read-only? mvl thinks just producing a 404 error by disabling the CGI may be enough).

 1. Turn off SF tracker. As this is not supported, just remove it from the project front page.

 1. Get final data dump.

 1. Populate Roundup with data dump.

 1. Turn on Roundup tracker.

 1. Find all pages in the web that refer to  "5470" (roughly 200 places) and replace them with the new tracker location. Likewise for the Python documentation itself.

 1. Hope we didn't screw up.  =)
