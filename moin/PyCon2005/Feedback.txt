Talks
3 Favorite Talks

Please list your 3 favorite talks.

Disclaimer: these are not scientific counts.

    *

      People are often vague (does "OO talk" mean Alex Martelli or Bruce Eckel?)
    *

      Some people wrote down more than three talks (e.g. "Roundup and Traits", "Alex's talks" -- both votes were counted in this case).
    *

      Some votes were ignored because I couldn't figure out what talk they referred to.
    *

      All votes for a lightning talk were counted as a vote for 'Lightning talks'.
    *

      All votes for something in open space were counted as votes for 'open space'.
    *

      Keynotes have an unfair advantage because so many people see them.
