= Python and Databases Brainstorm =

== Pamphlet ==
This is where we need to settle on what to cover in the flyer.  We need to keep it concise because there is not much room.  Here are the topics I think are relevant:

  * ''Almost'' any serious program needs persistent storage of some type.
  * The Python DBI gives a consistent look and feel to most databases.
  * A brief example on connecting to and calling a database.
  * Something about speed vs. C/C++ or Java?
