I would like to help with the maintenence.

I have also suggested that the MoinMoin software be updated, and I've sent FredrikLundh a logo image based on the Python Icon. -- DavidLeBlanc

Please attach that logo to the FrontPage, so I can add it. 

BTW, the InterWiki name of this Wiki is `PythonInfo`.

''well, I for one prefer the python.org-style logo you're using now  -- FredrikLundh''

''actually, so do I, but I'll attach it to the front page as decoration :) -- DavidLeBlanc''
