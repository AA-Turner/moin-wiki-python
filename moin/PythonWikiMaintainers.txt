I would like to help with the maintenence.

I have also suggested that the MoinMoin software be updated, and I've sent FredrikLundh a logo image based on the Python Icon. -- DavidLeBlanc

Please attach that logo to the FrontPage, so I can add it. 

BTW, the InterWiki name of this Wiki is `PythonInfo`.

''well, I for one prefer the python.org-style logo you're using now  -- FredrikLundh''

''actually, so do I, but I'll attach it to the front page as decoration :) -- DavidLeBlanc''

The [http://python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/RecentChanges?action=rss_rc RSS feed] of RecentChanges is failing. I get a nice cgitb traceback with a KeyError. It works on other MoinMoin Wikis, so something needs to be fixed here. -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-07-21T14:08:09)]]

XML features need PyXML installed. I'll look what I can do. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-22T21:39:35)]]

What do we do with dead links? Should we just remove them or mark them? ''Dead links'' page makes any sense? -- DrazenDimoti [[DateTime]]
