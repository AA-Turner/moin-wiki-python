== Are you a Python Wiki Maintainer? ==

If you contribute to the Python Wiki you are! This page is for discussing administration of the Python Wiki. If you want to scurry around and help keep the Wiki well structured and clean up any problems that arise or have any questions about those topics, this is the place.

{{{#!wiki tip

Don't forget the [[WikiGuidelines|editing guidelines]] for the Wiki!

Of course, you don't have to register or say anything here, just pitch in and do it - that's the Wiki:WikiWay!
