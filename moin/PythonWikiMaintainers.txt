== Discusiion ==
I would like to help with the maintenence.

I have also suggested that the MoinMoin software be updated, and I've sent FredrikLundh a logo image based on the Python Icon. -- DavidLeBlanc

Please attach that logo to the FrontPage, so I can add it. 

BTW, the InterWiki name of this Wiki is `PythonInfo`.

''well, I for one prefer the python.org-style logo you're using now  -- FredrikLundh''

Interesting.  The menu bar at the top contain english keywords, except that the TitleIndex
link is spelled TitelIndex.  When I click on that, I get a listing in german.  What gives?
