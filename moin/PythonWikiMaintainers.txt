=== Are you a Python Wiki Maintainer? ===

If you contribute to the Python Wiki you are! This page is for discussing administration of the Python Wiki. If you want to scurry around and help keep the wiki well structured and clean up any problems that arise or have any questions about those topics, this is the place. 

Of course, you don't have to register or say anything here, just pitch in and do it - that's the Wiki:WikiWay!

The [http://python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/RecentChanges?action=rss_rc RSS feed] of RecentChanges is failing. I get a nice cgitb traceback with a KeyError. It works on other MoinMoin Wikis, so something needs to be fixed here. --  JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-07-21T14:08:09)]]

XML features need PyXML installed. I'll look what I can do. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-22T21:39:35)]]

Any progress here yet? -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-10-04T10:31:39)]]

What do we do with dead links? Should we just remove them or mark them? ''Dead links'' page makes any sense? -- DrazenDimoti [[DateTime]]

Change the link to link to a DeadLink page, which explains that anyone who knows the right link should edit the page? -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-10-04T10:31:39)]]
