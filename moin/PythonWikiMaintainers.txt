=== Are you a Python Wiki Maintainer? ===

If you contribute to the Python Wiki you are! This page is for discussing administration of the Python Wiki. If you want to scurry around and help keep the wiki well structured and clean up any problems that arise or have any questions about those topics, this is the place. 

Of course, you don't have to register or say anything here, just pitch in and do it - that's the Wiki:WikiWay!

Hope I haven't overreached myself with all the additions and restructuring. -- DavidLeBlanc

How about updating to the current release of MoinMoin? Some of the plugins and macros might be nice too, especially the one that will display python chroma-coded. -- DavidLeBlanc

----
And while updating, both the wiki name and icon should be replaced by something fitting to Python. -- jh (I guess we don't have @''''''SIG@ yet)

P.S.: If someone in charge finds this useful, I'd volunteer to maintain this instance. All I need is a shell account with enough (group) rights to access the wiki directories.

''The PythonOrg powers that be has been notified.  Expect something in your mail
soonish. --FredrikLundh''

I would like to help with the maintenence.

I have also suggested that the MoinMoin software be updated, and I've sent FredrikLundh a logo image based on the Python Icon. -- DavidLeBlanc

Please attach that logo to the FrontPage, so I can add it. 

BTW, the InterWiki name of this Wiki is `PythonInfo`.
