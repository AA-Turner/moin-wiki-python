PyOhio is a daylong regional miniconference being planned for the summer of 2008 in Columbus, OH.

Budget
------

Let's try to avoid having one!  If we can get a location for free and turn attendees loose for lunch, we can avoid this headache.  

Location
--------

Requirements:

 * Ideally, space for 2 talks of ~ 50 attendees each, plus 2 Open Space groups of ~ 20 each 

 * Wireless!  Absolutely crucial if we have sprints, very desirable otherwise

Places to check with:

 * Ohio Supercomputing Center

    They did, after all, put this on: http://www.osc.edu/press/releases/2007/python.shtml

 * Universities

 * High schools

 * Library

    The Columbus Public Library has a very generous policy on letting groups meet: http://evanced.columbuslibrary.org/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp  The only problem is the funny capacity: a 200-seating auditorium (OK but overkill) and two conference rooms (seating 15 and 10).  That would suit a single talk track and two open spaces OK, but things would get funny in the afternoon when it's all open spaces.

 * Private company

    Anyplace with substantial Python-using population might be willing

 * Training companies

    The Cincinnati and Dayton branches of New Horizons have been friendly to user groups; is that true of Columbus?

Schedule
--------

I suggest one or two tracks of pre-scheduled talks in the morning, with Open Space available outside.  The afternoon can be an unconference, devoted entirely to Open Space.

Anyone who would like to schedule a sprint in conjunction with PyOhio should definitely do so!

Projectors
----------

CatherineDevlin can borrow one from work.  Can anybody else?

Sponsors
--------

Shouldn't be necessary, since we're trying to go without a budget.  However, if any sponsors do appear, there are some things they could do for us:
 
 * Buying lunch or snacks

 * Swag or door prizes

 * Paying for a locale (if all else fails)

 * Paying for an after-party

After-party
-----------

Don't look at me, I'm a nerd.  But it is a possibility...
