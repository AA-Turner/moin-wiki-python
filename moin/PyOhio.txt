PyOhio is a daylong regional miniconference being planned for the summer of 2008 in Columbus, OH.

We are very much still in the planning stages, and this page is being used to gather notes.

Budget
------

Let's try to avoid having one!  If we can get a location for free and turn attendees loose for lunch, we can avoid this headache.

Schedule
--------

I suggest one or two tracks of pre-scheduled talks in the morning, with Open Space available outside.  The afternoon can be an unconference, devoted entirely to Open Space.

Anyone who would like to schedule a sprint in conjunction with PyOhio should definitely do so!

And let's have Lightning Talks!

Brochure
--------

Attendees should get a handout describing:

 * what Open Spaces are & how to participate

 * scheduled talks with their abstracts

Sponsors
--------

Shouldn't be necessary, since we're trying to go without a budget.  However, if any sponsors do appear, there are some things they could do for us:
 
 * Buying lunch or snacks

 * Swag or door prizes

 * Paying for a locale (if all else fails)

 * Paying for an after-party

After-party
-----------

Don't look at me, I'm a nerd.  But it is a possibility...
