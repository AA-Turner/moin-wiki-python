Brochure
--------

Attendees should get a handout describing:

 * what Open Spaces are & how to participate

 * scheduled talks with their abstracts

 * other conferences of interest - Penguicon and Ohio Day of .NET have already agreed to promote PyOhio in their program guides, and we'll reciprocate

Sponsors
--------

Shouldn't be necessary, since we're trying to go without a budget.  However, if any sponsors do appear, there are some things they could do for us:
 
 * Buying lunch or snacks

 * Swag or door prizes

 * Paying for a locale (if all else fails)

 * a Kinko's (or whatnot) card for our program guides / handouts

 * Paying for an after-party

So far, the following sponsors have (contacted us out of the blue and) volunteered to provide goodies:

`Apress <http://apress.com/>`_ will send books and swag

`Python Magazine <http://pythonmagazine.com/>`_ will send magazines and run an online ad

Thanks very much!
