= Python =
We have included the Python distribution in several forms:
 * in the root of the CD is a directory `python/`, containing installable versions for all major operating systems as well as the python source code for compiling Python yourself
 * on the bootable linux system, python is already installed, ready to run:
  * python 2.3.4 (latest and greatest, use this!)
  * python 2.2.3
  * python 2.1.3

The older versions are provided for satisfying dependencies of other stuff and to be able to try compatibility of your source code.
