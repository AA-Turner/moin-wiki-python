= Python =
The PythonCd includes the Python distribution in several forms:
 * In the top level directory of the CD is a directory `python/`, containing installable versions for all major operating systems as well as the Python source code, if you want to compile it yourself.
 * On the bootable Linux system, Python is already installed and ready to run:
  * Python 2.3.4 (latest and greatest, use this!)
  * Python 2.2.3
  * Python 2.1.3

The older versions are provided for satisfying dependencies of other stuff and to be able to try compatibility of your source code.
