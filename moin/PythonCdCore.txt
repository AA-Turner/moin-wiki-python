The PythonCd includes the Python distribution in several forms:

= Installable Python packages =
In the top level directory of the CD is a directory `python/`, containing several packages of Python:
 * Python for Linux - most Linux distributions include Python, so we don't provide it for them
 * Python for Mac OS X
 * Python for Windows, win32all extension
 * Python for DOS - no maintainer yet, so we only provide an URL
 * Python source code, if you want to compile it yourself

= Ready-to-Use Python =
On the bootable Linux system, Python is already installed and ready to run:
 * Python 2.3.4 (latest and greatest, use this!)
 * Python 2.2.3
 * Python 2.1.3

The older versions are provided for satisfying dependencies of other stuff and to be able to try compatibility of your source code.
