=== Presentations ===
2 half an hour slots

in no particular order (yet):

 * Erik Groeneveld, Solving generator composition (continuation from 4 oktober NLLLG meeting)
 * Jelmer Vernooij, How Samba and OpenChange use Python

=== Lightning talks ===
5 five minute slots

 * Christoper Butcher, Speech recognition extension library
 * Guido Wesdorp, functional testing of AJAX webapps
 * Matthijs Kadijk, experiences with Google App engine and Django
 
 * Remco Wendt, 1 minute python tricks (so that would be 5 tricks in total ;)), if anybody else has something more interesting. By all means: kick me out of the planning
