= Python Remote Objects =

Pyro is an acronym for PYthon Remote Objects. It is a basic Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python, and for use in Python only (though it works a bit in Jython, too). With this, it closely resembles Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It is less similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent Distributed Object Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI.
