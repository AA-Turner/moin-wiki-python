I am a former student of JeffreyElkner who initially taught me python in 2001.  I now use python daily for work on Can``Do, an online competency tracking software built on School``Tool and Zope3.

I am currently a Sophomore at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.  My studies include mostly applied mathematics with a twist of pure mathematics zest.
