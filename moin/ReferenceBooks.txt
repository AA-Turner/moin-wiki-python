The following books aim to be definitive references, either by
publishing the Python documentation or by writing new reference-style
material, and therefore should be useful throughout your Python
programming career.

Most of these books will contain short, highly condensed introductions
to Python, and if you're an experienced programmer these titles may be
all you need. See the list of IntroductoryBooks if you'd prefer a book
with more examples and a slower pace.

The third edition that covers Python 2.4 language features and a variety of new modules added to the standard library.   The comments below apply to the 1st and 2nd editions.

A concise reference for Python 2.1, about as close as you can get to
the K&R for Python. The first hundred pages are a complete but very
compressed introduction to the language; the rest of the book is
reference material on all of the standard library modules.

Some of the reviews below are for the first edition of this book. The
second edition updated it without losing any of the first edition's
virtues.
