The Portland Portland Python User Group meets every second Tuesday at the [http://www.luckylab.com/ Lucky Labrador Pub] in SE Portland, Oregon.

We've recently re-formed the Portland Python group thanks to interest built up on the Meetup page and through the efforts of [http://python.meetup.com/183/members/1755741/ Brad Allen].  It's still very early days- please help us spread the word that Portland Python is back!
