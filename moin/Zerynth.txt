= Zerynth is Python Embedded in Real-time =
[[http://www.zerynth.com|Zerynth]] (formerly known as Viper) is an easy to use, professional and performant development suite for the cross-platform and high level design of interactive objects, artistic installations, and internet/cloud connected devices.

Zerynth is an open source, powerful, easy and affordable way to develop innovative devices and applications based on the ARM Cortex 32-bit micro-controllers combined with other state-of-the-art sensors and actuators, and expansion boards. It enables fast prototyping with leading-edge bards and components that can quickly be transformed into final designs. Programming Examples and reference designs for many applications are provided and they help designers to make the transition from prototype to final product even smoother.

Zerynth runs on the most used prototyping boards like: Arduino DUE, UDOO, ST Nucleo, Spark Core and Photon, and also on professional hardware based on ARM micro-controllers.

Zerynth is a solution for creatives, designers and IoT professionals who need to focus their efforts on projects design and ideas without caring about non-added value elements like: low level programming of the particular micro-controller board; device drivers; memory; etc. However Zerynth integrates a real-time operating systems which also allows designer to use all the features of embedded hardware if required.

Zerynth is not just another programming library for Arduino associated with a sensor kit. Zerynth is composed of a set of open source tools developed from scratch in order to allow users to approach to the embedded world in few clicks.

= The Zerynth Suite Components =
 * The [[http://www.zerynth.com/zerynth-virtual-machine/|Zerynth Virtual Machine]] is the core of the Zerynth suite. With Zerynth VM it is possible to develop Python 3 scripts that are virtually independent of the selected hardware platform allowing an high code reusability and integration.
 * The [[http://www.zerynth.com/zerynth-studio/|Zerynth Studio]] is a dedicated development environment. From the Zerynth Studio users can develop their scripts saving them locally and syncing with the cloud. Through the Zerynth Studio it is possible to manage all the boards by customizing them and installing the right virtual machines.
 * The [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thingsoninternet.biz.viperapp&hl=en|Zerynth App]] is a very simple and ready to use mobile application which allows users to monitor Zerynth based objects from mobile without writing any single line of code for Android or iOS The Zerynth App. When launched the Zerynth App discovers all the Zerynth devices available on the network. Once one of them is selected the App will become its interface. Zerynth App interfaces are based on HTML 5 templates that can be edited through the Zerynth Studio integrating them in the Zerynth Python scripts. Zerynth app Templates support JQuery Mobile!
