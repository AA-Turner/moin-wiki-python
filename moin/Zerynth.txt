= Zerynth is Python Embedded in Real-time =
[[http://www.zerynth.com/|Zerynth]] (formerly known as Viper) is an easy to use development suite for Arduino and other ARM 32 micro-controller boards.

Zerynth is a change of paradigm! With Zerynth it is possible to develop in Python for various 32bit boards using paradigms and features typical of PC and mobile programming.  Unlike other solutions on the market, Zerynth is cross-platform and compatible with all sensors and kits.

Zerynth is a set of open source tools developed and professionally maintained with a specific mission: make design and prototype activities enjoyable

== Zerynth VM ==
The core of Zerynth is the [[http://www.zerynth.com/zerynth-virtual-machine/|Zerynth Virtual Machine]]. It runs on top of a multithreaded real-time operating system and once installed on the Arduino DUE make it able to run Python 3 compiled scripts.

Zerynth VM supports all the most used high-level features of Python like modules, classes, multithreading, callbacks, timers and exceptions, plus all the Arduino hardware-related features like interrupts, PWM, digital I/O, etc.

== Zerynth Studio ==
Zerynth scripts can be uploaded on the Arduino through the [[http://www.zerynth.com/zerynth-studio/|Zerynth Studio]], a browser-based development environment with cloud sync and board management features, that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.

== Zerynth App ==
Zerynth also includes a ready to use mobile app ([[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thingsoninternet.biz.viperapp&hl=en|Zerynth App]]) that acts as an interface for all the Zerynth powered projects. When launched the Zerynth App discovers all the Zerynth devices available on the network. Once one of them is selected the App will become its interface. Zerynth App interfaces are based on HTML 5 templates that can be edited through the Zerynth Studio integrating them in the Zerynth Python scripts. Zerynth app Templates support JQuery Mobile!
