To implement new features and clean up the code without breaking third-party tools that rely on undocumented internals, distutils has been forked under the name distutils2 and developed outside of Python’s standard library, until it was complete enough to be merged back. In Python 3.3, distutils2 has been reintegrated, under the name packaging.

See [[Distutils2/Contributing]] for bug and patch submission guidelines.
