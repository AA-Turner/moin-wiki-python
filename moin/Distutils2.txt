To implement new features and clean up the code without breaking third-party tools that rely on undocumented internals, distutils has been forked under the name distutils2 and developed outside of Pythonâ€™s standard library, until it was complete enough to be merged back. In Python 3.3, distutils2 has been reintegrated, under the name packaging.

See [[Distutils2/Contributing]] for bug and patch submission guidelines.

Setup instructions for the 2012 sprints in Montreal are here: [[Distutils2/Sprints]].
