When a new release nears activity on the python-dev mailing list accelerates as people try to track down and fix
bugs that have eluded previous efforts.  Often, bugs which show up only on relatively minor platforms are
hard to test because most of the people on the python-dev list have run-of-the-mill computing environments.

Here's your change to help out.  If you would be able to help test Python on non-mainstream platforms,
add a row to the table below.  The definition of "mainstream" is obviously vague, but includes old versions
various Linux distributions (e.g., RedHat 6.2), Unix distributions which have fallen out of favor (e.g., IRIX)
and any non-Unix platform other than Windows.
