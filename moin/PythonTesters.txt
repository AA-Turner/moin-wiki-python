When a new Python release nears, activity on the python-dev mailing list accelerates as people try to track
down and fix bugs that have eluded previous efforts.  Some of the most difficult bug fixes to test are for
relatively minor platforms, because most of the people on the python-dev list have run-of-the-mill
computing environments.

Here's your chance to help out.  If you would be able to help test Python on non-mainstream platforms,
add a row to the table below.  The definition of "mainstream" is obviously vague, but includes old versions
various Linux distributions (e.g., Red Hat 6.2), Unix distributions which have fallen out of favor (e.g., IRIX)
and any non-Unix platform other than Windows.
