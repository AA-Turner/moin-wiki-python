NumArray was a reimplementation of Numeric.  It is being phased out in favor of NumPy.

Its web page was http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray (no longer works)

[[http://www.numpy.org/|NumPy]] is the recent reimplementation of Numeric.  As both developers of Numeric and Numarray are moving to NumPy,  NumPy is a good choice for new applications.
