NumArray is the current reimplementation of [http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/ Numeric].

Take a look at 
http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray
It is 100% backwards compatible with Numeric (at least on the Python side - the C API is also very close though).

[http://numeric.scipy.org/ Numpy] is an even newer reimplementation of Numeric.  Numpy is a good choice for new applications.
