What we need to find before the Conference in 2006

 The idea is that department heads can list items here that they will need and people who can get them(particularly free) will list what they have available.  Some people may doubt how much trust we could put in getting supplies this way.  That is a fair question.  I suggest that is you have something to offer, that you put some way of contacting you.  The department head can evaluate for themselves whether they trust the source.  The hope is that we can find cheap or free local suppliers for many items.

  I am going to start off by listing a few items I know we need.

  * Power strips, quantity 100 to 200
  * Overhead projectors for small rooms, quantity 2
  * Overhead projector for main room, quantity 1 or 2
