This page should help beginners decide which of the many libraries for GuiProgramming is best for their particular needs.

<<TableOfContents>>

= Features =

== Widgets ==

Which Widgets are available? In the base distribution? In additional libraries? Are the additional libraries portable as well?

== Portability ==

On which platforms is the toolkit available? Is the code written for the toolkit really portable or does the application behave differently on some platforms?

== Ease of Installation ==

Is it easy to install all the parts necessary? Is is easy to bundle the libraries with the application to allow for a single installer and no version dependencies?

== Integration into Desktop ==

Does it look and behave like a native application? Is it possible to make use of special features of a specific platform (say: minimize to tray on Windows)?

= Learnability =

== Newbie Documentation ==

What documentation is there to learn the toolkit? Demos, tutorials, books etc. Are GUI builders available?

== Reference Documentation ==

Most toolkits are written for a different language. Is there Python specific documentation available? If not, is it easy to translate the documentation to the Python view?

== Demo Applications ==

Are there any real application written for this toolkit to show off advanced features?

= Limits =

Is it possible to write your own widgets in 100% Python? How's the future of the toolkit? How easy is it to build all the parts from scratch if no one updates the binaries? Is this true for all platforms?

= Licence =

GPL, BSD like, commercial, on all platforms?
