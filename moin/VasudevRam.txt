[[https://vasudevram.github.io|Vasudev Ram (Dancing Bison Enterprises)]] is an independent software consultant, developer, trainer and writer, and a Fellow of the [[http://www.python.org/psf|Python Software Foundation]]. He is the creator of [[https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#xtopdf|xtopdf]], a toolkit for creation of PDF from other data formats, [[https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#PDFXMLRPC|PDFXMLRPC]], a toolkit and a pair of applications for client-server creation of PDF from text over the Internet, and [[https://vasudevram.github.io/products.html#PySiteCreator|PySiteCreator]], a tool for creating Web pages by writing them entirely in Python. All those products are written in Python. But Vasudev is not - written in Python, that is :-) He is not sure what language he is written in (if any). If interested, you could try asking the Great Developer in the Sky.
