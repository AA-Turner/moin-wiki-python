== Team members ==

These are team members who review job postings and help giving usability feedback to the developers:

 * ''Please add your name here.''

 * GilesThomas
 * MarcAndreLemburg
 * PatriceNeff
 * [[BrunoFagundez|Bruno Fagundez]]
 * [[gourneau|gourneau]]
 * SimonHayward

== Review Criteria ==

Reviewers should review job posting based on these criteria. Postings which do not meet these criteria should be **rejected**. The submitters should get an email explaining what to correct and then allow for the posting to be resubmitted.

 * job descriptions should include a clear mention of how Python will be used
 * Python should be the main implementation language used in the job
 * all positions must be paid positions
 * all ads have to be in English
 * job descriptions must either be plain ASCII, ReST or HTML
 * the job URL must point to a meaningful web page, e.g. the company page, a more detailed job description, etc.
 * the email address used in the posting should look like a valid email address

== Review Process ==

The jobs app provide a page which lists all jobs in the approval queue:

 * http://www.python.org/newjobs/review/

New jobs will automatically be listed on this page. Jobs can be ''approved'', ''rejected'' or ''removed''. The processes to be used for each of these steps are described below.

If you make a mistake, e.g. hit the wrong button, you can fix this by going to the jobs table admin interface and manually adjust the status of the job posting again:

 * http://www.python.org/admin/jobs/job/

(if you need help with this, please ask on the jobs mailing list)

=== Approval Process ===

Before hitting the approval button, please review the posting by clicking on the id number of the posting. This will open the job details page, which allows you to check the job description.

==== Posting not compliant ====

If you find that the job description does not comply to the review criteria listed above, please:

 * add a comment to the details page and then
 * hit the ''reject'' button on the review page

to have the posting rejected. The job submitter can then file a new updated posting.

Please include a mention of this process in the comment, as example:

 Your job posting does not comply to our posting criteria, so we have to reject it. Please file a new job posting with a more specific description of how Python is being used. We will then review the new posting.

The system will post this comment to the submitter, so no additional email is necessary.

==== Posting compliant ====

If a job posting complies to the above review criteria, please make sure that:

 * the "Posted xxxx" start date at the bottom of the page is correct (for job posting ported from the old job page, this may not be the case).
 * the "Looking for" job type is set
 * the "Category" job category is set

If any of the above are not correct, please open the job entry in the jobs table admin interface and adjust the settings:

 * http://www.python.org/admin/jobs/job/

and adjust the settings to:

 * start date = date submitted
 * end date = 3 months after submission
 * job type = ...
 * job category = ...

(if you need help with this, please ask on the jobs mailing list)

If everything looks fine, please:

 * enter a comment on the details page which mentioned the approval of the posting and then
 * hit the ''approve'' button on the review page

to have the posting approved and listed.

The comment should mention the approval of the posting, e.g.

 You job posting has been approved by the Python Job Board Team and will display on the jobs.python.org website later today.

The system will post this comment to the submitter, so no additional email is necessary.

==== Not sure whether compliant or not ====

If you are not sure whether a posting is compliant or not, you can either:

 * leave it untouched for someone else to pick up and decide, or
 * write to the jobs list asking for help/guidance/opinions
