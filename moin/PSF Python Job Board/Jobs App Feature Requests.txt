= Jobs App Feature Requests =

Based on the user stories and reviews we're collecting on these pages:

 * [[/Jobs App Reviews]]
 * [[/Jobs App User Stories]]

we are distilling a list of feature requests / ideas on this page and assign them to implementation phases:

== Phase 1: Launching the new Job Board ==

The new job board should have a minimal feature set implemented, since we want to launch as soon as possible. More complex features can be added later on.

 * job entry has to be possible for job submitters

 * job posting must be reviewable through the review page

 * the system should provide basic aid in emailing the job submitters about their postings

 * the job listing should be usable enough to provide an overview of the available job postings

== Phase 2: Cleanup and Usability Improvements ==

For this phase, we can add new features that simplify the processes and enhance usability:

 * add a possibility to provide a deadline for applications to a job posting; after this date the posting will no longer be displayed

 * add citizenship/visa requirements field to job applications, possibly also if any sponsorship for the same is available.

 * add contract/permanent/temporary/contract->permanent/etc field to job applications.

 * possibly add linguistic requirements field.
