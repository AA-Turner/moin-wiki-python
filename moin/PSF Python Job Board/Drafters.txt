= PSF Python Job Board Drafters =

These are team members who help porting existing job postings from the old job board page and new postings to the jobs mailing list into the database:

== Team members ==

 * ''Please add your name here.''

 * MarcAndreLemburg

== Tasks ==

 * add existing job postings from the [[http://legacy.python.org/community/jobs/|single page version of the job board]] to the database as approved entries

 * add job postings sent to the [[https://mail.python.org/mailman/private/jobs/|jobs list since mid-January]] to the database as draft entries

Having both in the database will make it easier to review the job app and detect bugs.

== Resources ==

 * [[https://www.python.org/admin/jobs/job/|Jobs table in the Django admin interface]]
