FAQs regarding using the Job Board django admin interface :

category : Since the admin system doesn't currently let you choose one, you must determine the number of the category.  You can do this by clicking on the search icon next to the category box then hovering over the item. You will see the number in the url at the bottom (for example, software engineer is 2)

job type : Choose some if they match, Make a note if you have ideas for new types that you didn't see on the list

region : do your best or duplicate the city name if you don't know the region since this is a required field

start date : today

end date : today plus 3months

status : review (this will indicate the posting is ready for review by a Job Board member)

agencies checked means "ok for agencies to contact"
