Coach: Bruce Eckel

The goal of this sprint is to understand the two proposed additions to Python:

  * Adapters (PEP 246) http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0246.html
  * Interfaces (PEP 245) http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0245.html

And to come up with examples and use cases that argue for or against the inclusion
of these features into the language.

This will primarily be a learning and exploration Sprint, and I imagine
discussing these concepts and coming up with ideas and examples in group work.

The products of the sprint will be examples, use cases and prose to add to the
literature about these topics.

This Sprint will be held Tuesday, and will begin at about 10 am
