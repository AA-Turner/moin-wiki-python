= Home Page must haves =
Feel free to expand this, I just want to get down my priorities. Based on the stats, feedback at OSCON, and my own usage of python.org. The home page has a few very clear usage scenarios.

 * Someone knows nothing about Python, so the home page has to make it clear without a lot of extra navigation
 * A new or existing user needs to download Python (most typically the current version)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation !
 * Related to documentation is the need to search the current documentation and/or site
 * Then there are a whole host of other things to do

= Other home pages for consideration =

 * http://www.perl.org/
 * http://www.php.net/
 * http://openswf.org/
 * http://www.microsoft.com/net/

= Mailing List =

 * http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pydotorg-redesign

= IRC session =

There will probably be an irc session on Monday (2003-07-21) to discuss specific home page issues. Tenatively, Monday at 6 pm EST, irc.freenode.net, channel pydotorg-redesign.
