= Home Page must haves =
Feel free to expand this, I just want to get down my priorities. Based on the stats, feedback at OSCON, and my own usage of python.org. The home page has a few very clear usage scenarios.

 * Someone knows nothing about Python, so the home page has to make it clear without a lot of extra navigation
 * A new or existing user needs to download Python (most typically the current version)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation !
 * Related to documentation is the need to search the current documentation and/or site
 * Then there are a whole host of other things to do

= Other home pages for consideration =

 * http://www.perl.org/
 * http://www.php.net/
 * http://openswf.org/
 * http://www.microsoft.com/net/
 * http://www.apache.org/

= Mailing List =

 * http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pydotorg-redesign

= IRC session =

An IRC session took place between 18:00 and 17:30. Logs available here :[http://www.pollenation.net/assets/public/pydotorg-redesign/irclog210703.html html formatted] [http://www.pollenation.net/assets/public/pydotorg-redesign/irclog210703.txt raw]

In attendence were Kevin Altis, Tim Parkin, Matt Goodall, and Fred Drake.

= Other tasks =

 * Getting rid of PSA stuff and moving still-valid info to other parts of the site
 
 * Reorganizing [http://www.python.org/UserGroups.html UserGroups] and [http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html NonEnglish] -- there's currently a lot of overlap, and what I'd really like to do is move it to a database with multiple views
 
 * Figuring out how to manage the commercial exits and other kinds of links to external resources
 
 * Fixing up the pycon directory (I made a boo-boo when setting it up, and we'll need to move the old stuff before starting in on DC2004)

 * Reorganizing Intros and Newbies -- also a lot of overlap.
