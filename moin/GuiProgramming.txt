'''Note:''' This section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need, but please add any information you can contribute.

'''Todo:''': Would it be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, addon widgets, layout managers, ...

''Maybe it could answer the questions in ChoosingGuiToolkits for each toolkit?''

=== Some available GUI's for Python: ===

  || ["Wax"]             || WxWindows    || A wrapper to WxPython, easier and more "pythonic" ||
  || PythonCard   || WxWindows   || Both a framework and GUI builder. Can include wxPython code in PythonCard apps ||

  || PyUi            || OpenGL       || Specialized GUI Toolkit for generating GUIs for OpenGL programs. ||
  || ["PyGUI"]           || MacOS / Gtk  || Abstract, pythonic API encapsulating different platforms; At the moment runs on MacOS X/Carbon & Unix/Gtk ||
  || EasyGui           || Tk  || EasyGUI is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. ||

Anyone for a GuiProgrammingShootout?
