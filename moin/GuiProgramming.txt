'''Note:''' This section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need, but please add any information you can contribute.

'''Todo:''' Would it be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, addon widgets, layout managers, ...

''Maybe it could answer the questions in ChoosingGuiToolkits for each toolkit?''
