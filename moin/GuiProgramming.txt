'''Note:''' This section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need, but please add any information you can contribute.

'''Todo:''': Would it be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, addon widgets, layout managers, ...

''Maybe it could answer the questions in ChoosingGuiToolkits for each toolkit?''

CameronLaird's personal notes on Python GUIs [http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html] includes over 25 links to toolkits and techniques for connecting python with a GUI.

Other places to look are Thinki:PythonGuis at Thinki, and http://sensei.co.il/python/ui.html .

[http://www.opendocs.org/ Opendocs] has some material on Qt programming with python for onl-line reading.

Python City ([http://www.awaretek.com/plf.html]) has an on-line interactive GUI toolkit chooser for Python based on user-defined criteria: [http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html]
