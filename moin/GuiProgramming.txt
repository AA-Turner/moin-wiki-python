= GUI Programming in Python =
Python has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for it, from Tkinter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (also known as "native") technologies.

== Cross-Platform Frameworks ==
The major cross-platform technologies upon which Python frameworks are based include Gtk, Qt, Tk and wxWidgets, although many other technologies provide actively maintained Python bindings.

== Links ==
CameronLaird's personal notes on Python GUIs http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html includes over 25 links to toolkits and techniques for connecting python with a GUI.

Opendocs previously had some material on Qt programming with Python for on-line reading, but ownership of the domain appears to have lapsed. An online version of Boudewijn Rempt's book about PyQt for Qt 3, [[http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/|GUI Programming with Python: QT Edition]], is still available. An up-to-date book covering PyQt4, [[http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html|Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt]] by Mark Summerfield, is now available in print and as an online "rough cut". More details can be found on the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Books|PyQt Wiki]].

== Editorial Notes ==
The above lists should be arranged in ascending alphabetical order - please respect this when adding new frameworks or tools.

Currently, this section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need, but please add any information you can contribute. It might be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, add-on widgets, layout managers, etc. Maybe it could answer the questions in ChoosingGuiToolkits for each toolkit.
