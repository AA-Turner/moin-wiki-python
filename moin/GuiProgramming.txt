'''Note:''' This section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need and please come back when this Wiki is officially opened.

'''Todo:''': Would it be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, addon widgets, layout managers, ...

=== Some available GUI's for Python: ===

  * TkInter
  * WxPython
  * PyGtk / PyGnome
  * PyQt
  * FlTk
  * FxPy
  * AnyGui
  * [http://www.drizzle.com/~donn/Bethon.html Bethon] (for BeOS)
  * [http://picogui.org/ PicoGUI] (python library is included in the main release)

Anyone for a GuiProgrammingShootout?

(I removed references to IDLE and WingIDE, since they are not GUI development tools. They are Python development tools with a GUI. Not the same thing... Thinki:MaLy )

CameronLaird's personal notes on Python GUIs [http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html] includes over 25 links to toolkits and techniques for connecting python with a GUI.
