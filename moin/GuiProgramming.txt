'''Note:''' This section is rather incomplete. Don't be too disappointed if you can't find the information you need, but please add any information you can contribute.

'''Todo:''': Would it be useful to have information about the GUIs and development tools in a fixed format to make them more easily comparable (see WebProgrammingTemplate and WebProgrammingTemplateHelp). Some categories: directly supported widgets, addon widgets, layout managers, ...

(I removed references to IDLE and WingIDE, since they are not GUI development tools. They are Python development tools with a GUI. Not the same thing, see IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments -- Thinki:MaLy )

CameronLaird's personal notes on Python GUIs [http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html] includes over 25 links to toolkits and techniques for connecting python with a GUI.

Other places to look are Thinki:PythonGuis at Thinki, and http://sensei.co.il/python/ui.html .


[http://www.opendocs.org/ Opendocs] has some material on Qt programming with python for onl-line reading.
