= GUI Programming in Python =
Python has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for it, from TkInter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (also known as "native") technologies.

== Cross-Browser Frameworks ==
||'''Package''' ||'''Target''' ||Latest version ||Latest update date ||'''Notes''' ||
||[[https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-python|Atlas toolkit for Python]] ||All major Web Browsers ||0.12 ||2020-08-28 ||For versatile GUIs written in HTML/CSS and Python (no JavaScript needed) - The lightweight and easy-to-use toolkit to begin with GUI programming.  ||

== Cross-Platform Frameworks ==
The major cross-platform technologies upon which Python frameworks are based include Gtk, Qt, Tk and wxWidgets, although many other technologies provide actively maintained Python bindings.
