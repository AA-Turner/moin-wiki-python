= PyCon Recording BoF =



== Date and Time ==

Saturday, 7PM-8PM, in the PyCon office (on the lower level, next to Haneda A/B).

== The Plan ==

Here's the plan we came up after the Friday BoF.

We have been recording material to 1 hour-long digital videotape.

We have a number of hard drives loaned to us by Google.

On Saturday, we'll try to copy tapes into digital format on the hard drives.  Later we'll figure out how to get the digital files posted on YouTube or Google Video.

What you need to bring:

  * A laptop that can handle digital video.  (Mac using Quicktime or iMovie, Linux using dvgrab, Windows using ????).

Options:

  * if you have a video camera, bring it; we'll provide cameras, but the more cameras, the faster we'll go.

We'll provide the cameras, videotapes, and hard drives.

== History ==

Last year we recorded partial audio of the speakers, but much material was lost 
due to A/V problems.
We're paying more attention this year, and will probably have video as well as better-quality audio.

This will result in dozens of gigabytes of material that needs to be 
examined, edited, cleaned up, and packaged as a podcast or as streaming videos.  We're going to need a team of volunteers to work on it.

This is a great opportunity to learn about audio/video editing and 
podcasting, to experiment with editing software, and to practice 
your skills while contributing to the PyCon community.



== Friday Agenda ==

 * What needs to be done (editing, cleanup, podcast, uploading videos)
 * How to organize it (how do volunteers claim tasks? where do we put the raw material?)
 * Where will we post material (audio on python.org podcast; video on Youtube, Google Video, Show''''''Me''''''Do?) (someone from Google MTV took a disk of video back with them from linux.conf.au which helped things there)
 * Overly-ambitious thought: captioning/transcripts?
