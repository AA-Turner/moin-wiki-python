== The Plan ==

Current status: thanks to Herculean effort by Joe Baker (? I'm unsure of his last name ?),
Carl Karsten, and Cosmin Stejeream,
all of the videotaped material is being transferred
to digital files.  Sleeping on a cot in the A/V room overnight was involved.

The task may be done at this point; on Monday they were going through the tutorial recordings.


Last year we recorded audio of some speakers, but much material was lost 
due to A/V problems.
We're paying more attention this year, and will have video as well as a lot more and 
better-quality audio.

This will result in dozens of gigabytes of material that needs to be 
examined, edited, cleaned up, and packaged as a podcast or as streaming videos.  
We're going to need a team of volunteers to work on it.

This is a great opportunity to learn about audio/video editing and 
podcasting, to experiment with editing software, and to practice 
your skills while contributing to the PyCon community.


=== Questions? ===

Add any questions/suggestions to this section.


== Friday Agenda ==

 * What needs to be done (editing, cleanup, podcast, uploading videos)
 * How to organize it (how do volunteers claim tasks? where do we put the raw material?)
 * Where will we post material (audio on python.org podcast; video on Youtube, Google Video, Show''''''Me''''''Do?) (someone from Google MTV took a disk of video back with them from linux.conf.au which helped things there)
 * Overly-ambitious thought: captioning/transcripts?
