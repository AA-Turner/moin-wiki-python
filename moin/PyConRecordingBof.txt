= PyCon Recording BoF =

Last year we recorded partial audio of the speakers, but much material was lost 
due to A/V problems.
We're paying more attention this year, and will probably have video as well as better-quality audio.

This will result in dozens of gigabytes of material that needs to be 
examined, edited, cleaned up, and packaged as a podcast or as streaming videos.  We're going to need a team of volunteers to work on it.

This is a great opportunity to learn about audio/video editing and 
podcasting, to experiment with editing software, and to practice 
your skills while contributing to the PyCon community.


== Date and Time ==

A day and time for this BoF hasn't been set yet; I'm leaning toward some time Sunday morning.  If you have
a preference, please add good dates/times for you when you add your name to this page.

== Agenda ==

 * What needs to be done (editing, cleanup, podcast, uploading videos)
 * How to organize it (how do volunteers claim tasks? where do we put the raw material?)
 * Where will we post material (audio on python.org podcast; video on Youtube, Google Video, Show''''''Me''''''Do?) (someone from Google MTV took a disk of video back with them from linux.conf.au which helped things there)

== Attending ==

Add your name if you're interested.
