= PyCon Recording BoF =

Last year we recorded partial audio of the speakers, but much material was lost 
due to A/V problems.
We're paying more attention this year, and will probably have video as well as better-quality audio.

This will result in dozens of gigabytes of material that needs to be 
examined, edited, cleaned up, and packaged as a podcast or as streaming videos.  We're going to need a team of volunteers to work on it.

 * What needs to be done (editing, cleanup, podcast, uploading videos)
 * How to organize it (how do volunteers claim tasks? where do we put the raw material?)

Add your name if you're interested.
