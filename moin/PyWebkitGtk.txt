PyWebkitGtk provides python bindings around [http://webkit.org Webkit] when it has been compiled for GTK2.  PyWebkitGtk requires, and augments, PyGtk2.  Recent support has been added to PyWebKitGtk to provide full DOM access manipulation, including javascript code execution and evaluation.

PyWebkitGtk comes with a demo application which is practically a fully-featured web browser in its own right.
