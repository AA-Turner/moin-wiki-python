I'm using this page to record notes and reminders while assessing trackers.  Please do not edit these notes.  (Feel free to add a comment at the bottom of a section if there's something you want to respond to; just don't edit my text.)


= Trac =

'View Active Tickets' query only returns a single spam query, but 
the bugs **are** in the tracker.  Not sure why 'View Active' isn't working like I expect.

Provides a wiki.  This could be either a positive (easy to  write little documents) or a negative (yet another spam target).

Couldn't figure out how to log in.

You can assign bugs to anonymous -- probably a bug from our perspective.

Saving queries is non-trivial; you need to write a wiki invocation,
but can't save them directly.

Couldn't attach an image, but only because the file limit was too low;
attaching files is straightforward.  (It even displays patches
specially!)

Grouping by priority produces multiple groups for the same priority -- not sure how the result list is being sorted.

Speed is reasonably quick, even for large lists of results.

Notifications are clear.  There's an e-mail interface  for adding comments, but it's completely undocumented.  I guess it uses the subject line for the bug #, and the contents are then added as a comment.

= Roundup =

Slightly unclear how to sort to see most recent bugs (sort by
descending activity, it turns out).

Interface feels pretty zippy.  Also pleasantly simple compared to Jira.

Can't search based on attachments.

Can't sort users by ID, AFAICT.

Not receiving e-mails about my changes -- maybe I'll only receive messages
when other people edit my issues.

Didn't try e-mail interface yet.


= Jira =

No anonymous bug submissions, at least as currently configured.

Interface is very dense -- many links, graphs -- though not as bad as
Bugzilla.  Might be off-putting to random users.

On the other hand, that summary information is useful: who has the
most assigned bugs, which subsystems have the most bugs, etc.

Interface feels kind of slow -- it's not clear if this is because the
server is slow, the database is so large, or because the HTML takes a
while to render in my browser.

The home page is customizable, so you can remove displays you don't care about and add query displays for custom things.  It lets you shrink the page a bit.

Version list in search seems to be unsorted.

Fancy filtering interface.

Has RSS feeds, which is kind of neat.

I didn't receive any e-mails; not sure if they're disabled in this
installation, or if I need to do something to enable mail.


= Launchpad =

Filing a bug seems straightforward.  All the other use cases are feasible.

Has extraneous features -- translations, bzr branches, specifications -- that might confuse bug reporters.  Perhaps we'd use them, or perhaps we'd need to disable them.

Minor oddity: searching for bugs with patches lists a bug with three patches three times.

The ability to give a nickname for a bug is a neat idea.

Clicking on 'Python (upstream)' to change the status is not immediately obvious.

I couldn't decrypt the OpenPGP message Launchpad sent me (complains of a CRC error), so I couldn't confirm my key and try the e-mail interface.

The ability of cross-link Python bugs with bugs filed on other projects might be a really useful tool for getting more bug reports, and for introducing more people to Python maintenance.
