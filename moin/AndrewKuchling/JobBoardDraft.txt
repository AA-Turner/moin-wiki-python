Title: Automating the python.org job board

The python.org website includes a job board at http://www.python.org/community/jobs/
that is currently updated manually by volunteers in response to emails from companies.

The tasks done manually include:  

 * Adding a job upon request
 * Rejecting a posting with a reason (it may be non-Python or needs to be reformatted)
 * Dropping a posting without reply if it's spam
 * Reformatting a received posting or updating a posting on request
 * Removing a posting on request when the job is filled
 * Removing a posting because it has expired (say, when it's 3 months old).  

When processing a request, one of several form emails are used (job has been posted, rejected w/ reason, job has been removed, or job has been updated).

For this task, we seek to partially automate this process using Roundup.  While Roundup is best-known as a bug tracker, 
it's very flexible and the schema can be adapted to different 
uses.

First, you need to setup the schema - change the "issue" class to
"joboffer", add fields for "company name", "address", "country",
"posted-on".
Set the "status" values to "submitted", "reviewed", "closed",
"rejected".

Then create roles "Submitter", "Reviewer", and give the Submitter
role to all people who have an account. Submitters can do anything
to their job description until it's reviewed, when they can only
close it. Reviewers can see all job offers; Submitters only their
own ones. We *could* allow anonymous submissions, but then
submitters cannot close or review them.

Either allow editing messages (which I'm not sure whether it's
supported), or declare that the last message on each job offer
is the one that gets posted. As yet another alternative, a
"post-this" field could be added to the msg class, to be set
by the reviewer.

Edit the issue template page to incorporate the new fields, and
drop the fields that we don't need (such as keyword, priority,
status - or start with the "minimal" schema in the first place).

Write a "react"
hook that gets invoked every time a joboffer changes to "reviewed"
or "closed" state; this hook would probably generate a page 
So only the submitters and reviewers would see
the roundup interface.

The common "nosy" react hook would send messages to the job board
every time a new job offer is added, and send messages to the submitter
whenever a job is posted or rejected (for rejection, there probably
should be an explicit message also; for posting, we could arrange for
some standard message).
