Andrew,

Apologies for mishandling the misplaced question on BeginnersGuide/Overview.   I agree that's not the right place for Q&A, but I was trying to answer the anonymous question in a way the author might find the answer without having to be wiki-literate.

That said, I didn't understand your comment.   "Question answered by doc/faq/installed.txt." -- is that an installed file?   I have Python 2.4 (executables, not source) installed and doc doesn't have a faq subdir.   Or did you mean [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/installed.txt] -- which appears non-existant?

I'm 100% for putting everything in its place; I'm just not sure that a wiki-inexperienced person with this question would be able to find the answer given your response.

(And sorry if this isn't the way to do a "Talk" page.  I'm new to moin.  Please teach me if there's a better way.)

Cheers,
["Philip"]
