I am very new to programming, but with the little experience i have had i have learned to love it quickly. I am huge into music. I play and compose music all the time and i believe there is large a connection between the parts of the brain that is for composition and programming. When doing either you strengthen the other. I hope that computer science can later be the career that provides, so i can be free to write any and all of the music i want.
