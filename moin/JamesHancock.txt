I am very new to programming, but with the little experience i have had i have learned to love it quickly. I am huge into music, and i believe there is large a connection between the parts of the brain that is for music and programming. In both you have a goal(in music more of a feeling or concept) and near infinite possibilities and it is your job to find the best one.
