== General Information ==

  URL::http://buzhug.sourceforge.net

  licence::BSD

  platforms::all platforms supporting Python 2.3+

== Programming Model ==

buzhug is a fast, portable, pure-Python database engine, using a pythonic syntax for all operations

A database is an iterator, yielding objects with attributes matching the fields defined for the base ; requests can be expressed as list comprehensions or generator expressions, instead of SQL

== Pros ==
 * most operations are faster than on other pure-Python databases
 * concurrency control by versioning of records
 * simple system to link databases dynamically (a record of a base can be a field of another base)
 * complete documentation

== Cons ==
 * still beta : bug reports needed
 * no thread-safe feature : should be used behind an asynchronous server for multiple users
