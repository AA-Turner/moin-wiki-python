== General Information ==

  licence:: BSD
  platforms:: all platforms supporting Python 2.3+

== Programming Model ==

buzhug is a fast, portable, pure-Python database engine, using a pythonic non-SQL syntax for all operations

A database is an iterator, yielding objects with attributes matching the fields defined for the base . Requests can be expressed as list comprehensions or generator expressions, instead of SQL.

The data is stored and accessed on disk (it is not an in-memory database). The implementation has been designed to make all operations, and especially selection, as fast as possible with an interpreted language.

A limited benchmark using the same use cases as SQLite's author shows that buzhug is much faster than other pure-Python modules (KirbyBase, gadfly). SQLite, which is implemented in C, is faster, but only less than 3 times on the average.

== Pros ==
 * most operations are faster than on other pure-Python databases
 * concurrency control by versioning of records
 * simple system to link databases dynamically (a record of a base can be a field of another base)
 * complete documentation

== Cons ==
 * still beta : bug reports needed
 * no thread-safe feature : should be used behind an asynchronous server for multiple users
