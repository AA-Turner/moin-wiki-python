Hi.

I'm interested in how Python can be used in various ways - as a tool in various software development environments (ones that do not necessarily involve Python).  Included in this are

- Python as an object oriented language in conjunction with other object oriented environments such as J2EE-Spring-Hibernate, Ruby and including design patterns.
- Python as a functional programming language in conjunction with other  languages such as Lisp, Haskel and Scheme.
- Using Python in real application environments that involve Web 2.0, Web Services, database, and scripting.
