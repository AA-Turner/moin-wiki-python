The [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fdbus|D-Bus library]] is a messaging library used by various desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc) for interprocess communication.

There's a Python binding for it, but documentation is non-existent so I've collected these examples in hopes that they'll be useful and that people will update them as needed.

''Warning'': the D-Bus APIs change a lot, breaking code.  These examples were run with version 0.60 of the Python interface (0.60-6ubuntu8, on Ubuntu Dapper); they probably won't run on other versions.

This [[http://thaiopensource.org/development/suriyan/wiki/DbusNotes|draft tutorial]] is the clearest introduction to D-Bus that I've seen.

The `dbus-viewer` program lets you browse through the services and interfaces available on your system.

= Introspection =

{{{
# You must initialize the gobject/dbus support for threading
# before doing anything.
import gobject
gobject.threads_init()

from dbus import glib
glib.init_threads()

# Create a session bus.
import dbus
bus = dbus.SessionBus()

# Create an object that will proxy for a particular remote object.
remote_object = bus.get_object("org.freedesktop.DBus", # Connection name
                               "/org/freedesktop/DBus" # Object's path
                              )

# Introspection returns an XML document containing information
# about the methods supported by an interface.
print ("Introspection data:\n")
print remote_object.Introspect()
}}}

Output:
{{{
Introspection data:

}}}

If you get any of the connection or object names wrong, the exceptions you get are very obscure.  For example, when I add an incorrect trailing slash to the object in the example above (making "/org/freedesktop/DBus/"), the exceptions are:
{{{
8223: arguments to dbus_message_new_method_call() were incorrect, assertion "_dbus_check_is_valid_path (path)" failed in file dbus-message.c line 797.
This is normally a bug in some application using the D-BUS library.
8223: arguments to dbus_message_set_destination() were incorrect, assertion "message != NULL" failed in file dbus-message.c line 2728.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/amk/db.py", line 19, in ?
    data = remote_object.Introspect()

    self._pending_introspect.block()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'block'
}}}

Notice that the exception is triggered in the `.Introspect()` call, not in the erroneous `bus.get_object()` call.

= Calling an interface method =

After executing the introspection example:
{{{
# Get a particular interface
iface = dbus.Interface(remote_object, 'org.freedesktop.DBus')
print iface.ListNames()
}}}

Output:
{{{
[u'org.freedesktop.DBus', u':1.3', u'org.freedesktop.Notifications', u'org.gnome.PowerManager', u':1.24', u':1.4', u':1.0', u'org.gnome.ScreenSaver', u':1.5', u':1.1', u':1.48', u':1.2']

}}}


The following example makes your system hibernate:
{{{
# Get the power management object
power = bus.get_object('org.gnome.PowerManager',
                       '/org/gnome/PowerManager')
iface = dbus.Interface(power, 'org.gnome.PowerManager')

# Hibernate the system
if iface.CanHibernate():
    iface.Hibernate()
}}}
