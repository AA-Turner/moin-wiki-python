There is still time to propose a Tutorial (Thursday) or Conference (Friday-Sunday) talk.  Here is what people are asking for:

* `Core Python`_ - Just the facts, ma'am.

* `Twisted`_ - The most requested subject in 07.  How do you explain twisted in one session?

There are `tutorial suggestions from last year <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2007/Feedback/TutorialIdeas>`__, as well as the `feedback survey results <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2007/Feedback>`__ (& `survey comments <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2007/Feedback/Comments>`__).

Once you have picked a subject, check out the proposal process for `scheduled talks <http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/proposals>`__ and for `tutorials <http://us.pycon.org/2008/tutorials/proposals>`__.
