A framework for WebProgramming.
=== Masthead ===

   URL::  http://www.modpython.org/
   version:: 2.7.8 (''[[Date(2002-05-19T00:00:00)]]'')
   licence:: The Apache Software License, Version 1.1
   platforms:: Apache 1.3 (with Apache 2 support forthcoming)
   Python versions:: Python 1.5.2, 1.6, 2.0 or 2.1

=== Deployment Platforms ===

Linux and Windows. RPMs available.

=== Suitability ===

mod_python can be used to develop fast and small web tools and applications, and as part of larger custom application frameworks. It provides an object publishing mechanism similar to (but much simpler than) Zope, and a very clean mapping from URLs to functions. This makes it especially suitable for building web-accessible libraries using HTTP GET/POST as function call serialization.

=== Development Interfaces ===

=== Environment Access ===

mod_python provides a similar API to mod_perl, allowing low-level access to Apache's request handling mechanisms.

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

mod_python provides no built-in session support. It has a very straightforward and flexible system for basic authentication, allowing access rules to be configured at the module and function level.

=== Persistence Support ===

Scripts remain in memory between page loads. The Python interpreter can be configured to run per-site or per-directory, allowing the scope of the persistence to be limited as necessary.

=== Presentation Support ===

None. mod_python provides no built-in templating system, although it is not difficult to incorporate one.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections and other data between hits and access to Apache internals.
