 License:: MIT
 Platforms:: Windows, Linux
 Python versions:: 2.4 - 3.3


On Windows Platform, PyPyODBC provide a set of methods to bring [[https://code.google.com/p/pypyodbc/wiki/pypyodbc_for_access_mdb_file | PyPyODBC's extra support for Access on Windows Platform]]


PyPyODBC is a pure Python script, it runs on CPython / IronPython / PyPy , Version 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 , Win / Linux , 32 / 64 bit.


Almost totally same usage as pyodbc ( can be seen as a re-implementation of pyodbc in pure Python ).

Simple - the whole module is implemented in a single python script with less than 3000 lines.

Built-in Access MDB file creation and compression functions on Windows.



=== ODBC ===

It is possible to connect to an SQL Server database using ODBC, either the mxODBC driver or the one included with Win32all. However, this is not recommended - adodbapi is a better solution, in part because it supports unicode.

''Comment:'' This is actually not true at all: ODBC is the native API used for SQL Server and does support Unicode all the way. In fact, ODBC is the preferred way of accessing SQL Server if you care for performance. Microsoft has just released the [[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa937733.aspx|SQL Server Native Client]] which is an extended ODBC driver for SQL Server. ADO is just a layer on top of the ODBC interface and a lot slower as a result. See e.g. [[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/reskit/iischp7.mspx|MS TechNet]] for a comparison of ODBC, OLE DB and ADO, or [[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/389535|this cookbook entry]].

''Comment:'' Note about the comment above -- just because it should be pointed out, mxODBC is not a free product from what I can see, and the 'cookbook entry' from 2005 referenced above indicates that it is.
