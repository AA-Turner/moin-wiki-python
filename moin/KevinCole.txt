Like Howard the Duck, "trapped in a world he never made", I'm a procedural guy living in an object-oriented world -- not to mention that I'm surrounded by vi heathens who've not yet seen the light of the One True Editor.

I'm a programmer for the Gallaudet Research Institute, the Ubuntu Linux Washington, DC LoCo contact, and occasional writer of tutorials and tips for the less technical folks.
