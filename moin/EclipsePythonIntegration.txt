= Using Eclipse as a Python editor =

A few plugins for ["Eclipse"] are in progress that will enable Eclipse to be used as a 
Python IDE.  Some of these are stable enough for early use:
 * pyeclipse, 0.0.1 (July 16, 2002): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyeclipse/
 * pe4eclipse, 0.0.1 prealpha (September 17, 2002): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pe4eclipse/
 * pythoneclipse, no files (as of May 17, 2003): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythoneclipse/

= Embedding Jython into Eclipse =

Don Coleman has written a jython code completion shell which he says he would be happy to rewrite for Eclipse.
 * http://don.freeshell.org/jython/

This URL was given by Don Coleman in an ASPN jython users newsgroup, 
 * http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/Jython-users/1620125
but the domain "don.freeshell.org" is non-existent (DNS Error). 
Any other ideas where to find this code completion shell?

-- it works now (16. May 03)

= Configuring Eclipse for running Jython =

1. Install your choice of plug in.
 * Unzip the plugin download and drag it into the eclipse/plugins directory, then restart eclipse.
    pyeclipse is identified by the directory org.python.pyeclipse_0.0.1
    pe4eclipse is identified by the directory  net.sourceforge.pe4eclipse
 * Both plug-ins (pyeclipse and pe4eclipse) only really give you color highlighting for editing .py python/jython files.  That's all. Even the ability to run jython or python needs to be configured manually (see step 2, below) and doesn't require either of these plugins to do.  
 * Although the color highlighting of pe4eclipse is slightly nicer (or closer to what I am used to in pythonwin), I prefer the pyeclipse plug-in since it supports the SHIFT-TAB de-indent keystroke.  Vital! :-)
 * You can use Eclipse bookmarking and creating Tasks inside the python editors.  This is way cool.  Not even IDLE has bookmarking (though pythonwin does).
 * The latter plug-in (pyeclipse) also provides a 'python' perspective (although you can create these yourself) which shows the console window and hides the 'launch' button (which is only for running java apps).  To launch python or jython you must configure an external tool.

2. Configuring to run python from within Eclipse.
 * Instructions for this can be found in the pyeclipse forum
     http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=717580&forum_id=194323
 * NOTE that I prefer to set my Working Directory to ${container_loc} since this lets you launch python on files that are inside folders within your project.  More resilient.

 go to Run -> External Tools -> Configure -> New 
 - fill in the following values: 
Name: python 
Tool Location: E.g. /usr/bin/python or C:\Python22\python.exe 
Tool Arguments: -> Browse Variables -> ${resource_name} 
Working Directory: -> Browse Variables -> ${container_loc}
 
2. Configuring to run jython from within Eclipse.
 go to Run -> External Tools -> Configure -> New 
 - fill in the following values: 
Name: jython 
Tool Location: E.g. C:\jython-2.1\jython.bat
Tool Arguments: -> Browse Variables -> ${resource_name} 
Working Directory: -> Browse Variables -> ${container_loc}

Note: If you need to run an app which requires arguments, you will need to make another tool configuration (just copy the jython one) and simply add the arguments to the 
  e.g. Tool Arguments: -> Browse Variables -> ${resource_name} c:\\
Notice I have supplied the argument c:\\ 

Hope this helps
