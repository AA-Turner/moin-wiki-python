= Using Eclipse as a Python editor =

A few plugins for ["Eclipse"] are in progress that will enable Eclipse to be used as a 
Python IDE.  Some of these are stable enough for early use:
 * pyeclipse, 0.0.1 (July 16, 2002): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyeclipse/
 * pe4eclipse, 0.0.1 prealpha (September 17, 2002): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pe4eclipse/
 * pythoneclipse, no files (as of May 17, 2003): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythoneclipse/

= Embedding Jython into Eclipse =

Don Coleman has written a jython code completion shell which he says he would be happy to rewrite for Eclipse.
 * http://don.freeshell.org/jython/

This URL was given by Don Coleman in an ASPN jython users newsgroup, 
 * http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/Jython-users/1620125
but the domain "don.freeshell.org" is non-existent (DNS Error). 
Any other ideas where to find this code completion shell?

-- it works now (16. May 03)

= Configuring Eclipse for running Jython =

1. Install your choice of plug in.
 * This means unzipping the download and dragging it into the eclipse/plugins directory, then restarting eclipse.
 * Both plug-ins (pyeclipse and pe4eclipse) give you color highlighting for .py python/jython files.  Although the color highlighting of pe4eclipse is nicer, I prefer pyeclipse since it supports the SHIFT-TAB de-indent keystroke.  
 * The latter plug-in (pyeclipse) also provides a 'python' perspective (although you can create these yourself) which shows the console window and hides the 'launch' button (which is only for running java apps).  To launch python or jython you must configure an external tool.

2. Configuring to run python from within Eclipse.
 * Instructions for this can be found in the pyeclipse forum
     http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=717580&forum_id=194323
 * NOTE that I prefer to set my 
${container_loc}
