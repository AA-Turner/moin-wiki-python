= Using Eclipse as a Python editor =

A few plugins for ["Eclipse"] are in progress that will enable Eclipse to be used as a 
Python IDE.  Some of these are stable enough for early use:
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyeclipse
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pe4eclipse/
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythoneclipse/

= Embedding Jython into Eclipse =

Don Coleman has written a jython code completion shell which he says he would be happy to rewrite for Eclipse.
 * http://don.freeshell.org/jython/

This URL was given by Don Coleman in an ASPN jython users newsgroup, 
 * http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/Jython-users/1620125
but the domain "don.freeshell.org" is non-existent (DNS Error). 
Any other ideas where to find this code completion shell?

-- it works now (16. May 03)
