=== How to Make FSSpec's ===
This should probably be somewhere else, but it's too useful to wait until I can figure out where that would be. (Note: I have only tried this in Python 2.3)

{{{
#!python
from Carbon import File
spec = File.FSSpec('/normal/slash/based/unix/path/string')
}}}

That's ALL! Don't muck around with FSMakeFSSpec or CFURL or any of that stuff.
I found this [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pythonmac-sig/2003-March/007459.html on the pythonmac-SIG list].
