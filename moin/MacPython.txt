You can find information on Python on the Macintosh at http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython. Installers, documentation and much more is available there too.

(We could/should add pages about PackageManager (or PackMan), PyObjC / PythonCocoa, AppleEvents or AppleScript, CarbonApi, MacPythonIde, etc. Please expand. But first: should we use a "Mac" prefix for all MacPython-related wiki words?)
