Notes about Python Security.

== Taint mode ==

Nicole King (cats-muvva.net) wrote a taint mode for CPython 3.0: http://www.cats-muvva.net/software/

Problems:
 * amaury: ''The patch is indeed huge!''
 * fijall: ''it seems that every function that returns a PyObject must be modified''
 * fijall: ''need to patch (...) all places that might modify anything. (All side effects)''

=> ncoghlan: ''PyPy is still a *much* better platform for that kind of experimentation than CPython''
