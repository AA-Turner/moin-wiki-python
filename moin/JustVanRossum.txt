## page was renamed from MacPython/JustVanRossum
Just van Rossum is a Dutch (typo)graphic designer / MacPython guru. Started the /LettError virtual type foundry with ErikVanBlokland, with whom he worked at [[http://www.metadesign.com/|Meta Design]]. Fame came with the release of Beowolf (co-designed with ErikVanBlokland), a font whose ragged edges shift randomly each time you print the font. He's the developer of the [[/MacPythonIDE]], designed the popular [[http://starship.python.net/~just/pythonpowered/|Python Powered]] logo, developed /DrawBot and FontTools, helps out with [[PyObjC]] and MacPython, etc.

We've started a page with notes about learning Cocoa using [[/PyObjC]]: LtrWiki:StartCocoa
