                     EducationalSprint5MinuteIntroduction

You will spend most of your waking life communicating with other people.

Since you already know how to communicate in English and Python,
why would you want to spend 4 days in an EducationalSprint 
dedicated to helping others learn better communication?

1st Nearly all children begin speaking at 10 months.  
EducationalSprint will show how to cut it to 2 month's.

2nd  Most children under one system communicate at 3rd grade in 1st. 
EducationalSprint will explain the difference & help you program it.

3rd  Communication involves phonetics, morphology, orthography, 
phonology, syntax, semantics and much more.  Japanese phonology
consists of 8 rules.  English phonology and many other parts of 
English are still partially undiscovered.  
EducationalSprint will give you some algorithms for how to discover
the debated parts of English.  

4th  Speech recognition and computer translation are still important
unsolved computer problems.  I started in computer science and
linguistics in the early 1970's.  The reason we could not do better
speech recognition and computer translation was primarily because the
linguists did not know what they were doing.  Even less powerful
languages before  Python could have solved all of the computer science 
problems for speech recognition and inerrant fully automatic 
computer translations if the linguists could have explicitly stated
all of the rules.
EducationalSprint will help you understand beginning or elementary 
linguistics.  EducationalSprint will help you understand why many of the 
linguistic systems are insufficient and therefore failures for solving
problems like voice recognition and automatic machine translation.
EducationalSprint will help you understand how to use the power of 
Python to uncover the linguistic system necessary to solve problems
in education such as why Johnny had unnecessary problems in reading,
writing, spelling, speech recognition, and translation.  
If we have more than a handful of Pythonic programmers EducationalSprint 
will discover all of the linguistic rules in the most simple, most
hotly debated, and most debated areas of English.
