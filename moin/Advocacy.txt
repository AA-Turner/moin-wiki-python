== General Notes ==

Advocacy is the process of letting people know what Python is
good at, and drawing them into using the language.  The most effective
forms of advocacy lure users to the language by impressing them
with results, rather than brow beating or lecturing them on language design.

Published articles that answer the question "how do I solve X with Python?" are a good way to get people interested.

One goal for writing articles might be to develop a library of
How-Tos for Python.  Much information exists, but it has not been
collected for convenient access from python.org (or another central location), and there are
certainly gaps in covering key strengths of Python.

A collection of [http://python.org/about/success Python Success Stories] already exists.  These are also useful, usually by helping engineers convince their bosses that Python is worthy of attention.  But success stories tend to be lean on "how-to" style information, so they do not offer a convenient path to get new users working with Python.

Since the goal for advocacy is to highlight Python's strengths, [http://wingware.com/python this Key Strengths list] may be useful.

== Print and Online Magazines that Accept Technical Articles ==

We would like to focus on those magazines outside the Python community, in order to reach those who don't know about us.  Also there are many magazines that accept press releases that do not accept articles.  We need those that welcome articles.
