== Magazine Articles About Python I Would Like to See ==

 * Python and Relational Databases

   Talk about the DB-API that Python has standardized on, and how easy it is to write conventional SQL.  Then move into one of the ORMs for Python, perhaps SQLObject or SQLAlchemy.  Discuss how data types are automatically converted, and how cross-platform the solution is.  Highlight the different database engines supported, both open source and commercial.

 * Python and Object Databases

   Talk about how dynamic languages make a good match for object databases, with seamless serialization.  Provide an overview of how an object database works, but focus on the end-developer and not the underlying mechanisms.  Cover how the databases retain transaction support, and to what degree they provide support for the principles of ACID.  Discuss the popular ZODB, Durus and APE frameworks, their tradeoffs (e.g. read-mostly usage, transaction rates) and the fact that they can be used standalone without the baggage of Zope or Quixote.  Cover their lack of granular security and user identities at the database API level.
