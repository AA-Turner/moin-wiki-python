Discussions on advocating the use of Python take place on the following mailing lists:
 * [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/advocacy General Advocacy (everyone welcome)]
 * [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/usergroup-advocacy Committee to Support Usergroups]
 * [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/group-organizers Gathering of Current/Future Usergroup Leaders]

Greetings!  I'm the PythonAdvocacyCoordinator.  You can reach me via email at [[MailTo(advocate AT python DOT org)]].  I'm always glad to hear ideas or corrections.

== Current Focus ==

 * [wiki:/UsergroupSupport to support and encourage the formation of usergroups]
 * to create a series of 5-minute videos introducing uses of Python
 * to write whitepapers as a follow-on to the 5-minute videos

Want to help with some writing?  Check out our list of whitepaper/flyer AdvocacyWritingTasks or magazine ArticleIdeas.

== Suggestions ==

 * Identify a shirt store in Europe, to provide a more local source of Python wearables than Cafe Press.
 * Help complete the remaining 15% of Python-equivalent recipes (and review the existing 85% for being current with Python 2.5) of the [http://pleac.sourceforge.net Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook], a side-by-side comparison of algorithms in different programming languages based on the Perl Cookbook.
 * Do something about python.com!  Python is a great teaching language, but one of the first things a curious student is likely to do in search of more info is go to their browser and surf to www.python.com.  Yikes!  It is unlikely that we can get them to give up their domain name, but maybe they could be convinced to at least put up a front page with "You are about to enter an adult site, are you 18, etc..."  And if we were really lucky, their front page could contain "If you are looking for info on the Python programming language, go to www.python.org"  How can we "encourage" them to do the right thing?

== General Notes ==

Advocacy is the process of letting people know what Python is
good at, and drawing them into using the language.  The most effective
forms of advocacy lure users to the language by impressing them
with results, rather than brow beating or lecturing them on language design.

Published articles that answer the question "how do I solve X with Python?" are a good way to get people interested.

One goal for writing articles might be to develop a library of
How-Tos for Python.  Much information exists, but it has not been
collected for convenient access from python.org (or another central location), and there are
certainly gaps in covering key strengths of Python.

A collection of [http://python.org/about/success Python Success Stories] already exists.  These are also useful, usually by helping engineers convince their bosses that Python is worthy of attention.  But success stories tend to be lean on "how-to" style information, so they do not offer a convenient path to get new users working with Python.

Since the goal for advocacy is to highlight Python's strengths, [http://wingware.com/python this Key Strengths list] may be useful.

== Print and Online Magazines that Accept Technical Articles ==

We would like to focus on those magazines outside the Python community, in order to reach those who don't know about us.  Also there are many magazines that accept press releases that do not accept articles.  We need those that welcome articles.
