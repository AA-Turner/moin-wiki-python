The URL-specific code is spread across three modules (urllib, urllib2, and urlparse).  All three modules are rather old and could stand a cleanup and modernization along with a unification into a single module.  The modules at http://wwwsearch.sf.net should be taken into consideration in the process.
 * Hi, I'm interested in this project and would therefore like to receive further information on what you expect it to be. The first thing that came to my mind was rewriting the url modules in order to get parallelity (using select or poll). This would futhermore include a bit of redesign with the main focus on the http protocol. -- LinuxWiki:HelmutGrohne
