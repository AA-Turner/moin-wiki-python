= C/C++ =
There a various tools which make it easier to bridge the gap between Python and C/C++:

 * [http://www.swig.org/ SWIG] - generate extension module from your .h files 
 * ["boost.python"] - write (tiny) C++ class to wrap your classes in an extension module
 * ["Pyrex"] - write your extension module on Python (!)
 * [http://cxx.sourceforge.net/ CXX]
 * [http://starship.python.net/crew/gmcm/scxx.html SCXX]
 * ["weave"] - include C code lines in Python program 
 * ["SIP"] - similar to SWIG but specialised for Python and C++. Used to create PyQt, the ["Qt"] API wrapper library
 * [http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/ ctypes] is a Python module allowing to create and manipulate C data types in Python. These can then be passed to C-functions loaded from dynamic link libraries.
 * ["elmer"] - compile and run python code from C, as if it was written in C
 * [http://pwig.sourceforge.net/ pwig] is a SWIG extension for writting new language modules in Python.
