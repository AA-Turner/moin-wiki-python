There a various tools which make it easier to bridge the gap between Python and C/C++:

 * [http://www.swig.org/ SWIG] - generate extension module from your .h files 
 * ["boost.python"] - write (tiny) C++ class to wrap your classes in an extension module
 * [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex] - write your extension module on Python (!)
 * [http://cxx.sourceforge.net/ CXX]
 * [http://starship.python.net/crew/gmcm/scxx.html SCXX]
 * ["weave"] - include C code lines in Python program 

[Hint: The idea is to create pages for the stuff, not just link it.]
