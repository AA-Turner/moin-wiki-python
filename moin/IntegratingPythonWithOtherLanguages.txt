= C/C++ =
There a various tools which make it easier to bridge the gap between Python and C/C++:

 * [http://www.swig.org/ SWIG] - generate extension module from your .h files 
 * ["boost.python"] - write (tiny) C++ class to wrap your classes in an extension module
 * ["Pyrex"] - write your extension module on Python (!)
 * [http://cxx.sourceforge.net/ CXX]
 * [http://starship.python.net/crew/gmcm/scxx.html SCXX]
 * ["weave"] - include C code lines in Python program 
 * ["SIP"] - ["Qt"] API wrapper library
 * [http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/ ctypes] is a Python module allowing to create and manipulate C data types in Python. These can then be passed to C-functions loaded from dynamic link libraries.
 * ["elmer"] - compile and run python code from C, as if it was written in C

[Hint: The idea is to create pages for the stuff, not just link it.]

[[There are also interesting solutions for co-operation
between Python and such languages as Tcl,
Perl,
Fortran,
Prolog,
and many others.  
We'll write more on these subjects, in time.]]
