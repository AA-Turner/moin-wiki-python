In addition, ActiveState provides a quality assured enterprise version, OEM licensing, and support which may be attractive to some customers.  Two other products of ActiveState are Komodo IDE and Komodo Edit, which are useful IDEs for Python and other scripting languages. Since November 2007, there is a free and open source (http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo/browse/openkomodo) version of the Komodo Edit available, as part of the OpenKomodo project.
