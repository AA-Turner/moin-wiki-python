 * CleanupUrlLibProject
 * Cleanup/modernize a module(s) in the stdlib.  
 * The modules which deal with both str and unicode sometimes treat them differently -- which is usually a bug.
 * CompleteSslSupport
 * UnicodeonWindowsExtensions
 * ProfileReplacementProject
 * ../FileSystemVirtualization
 * ../EnhancedIterTools
 * ../ExploreFunctionalProgramming
 * MakeXmlrpclibAsynchronous
 * Add cross compiling support in distutils (and otherwise improve distutils).
 * Work on unit test suite. This includes not only developing support code (such as decorators to flag tests that are implementation-specific, known to fail, etc.), but also to have more code coverage in the unit tests.
 * Improve Python Debugger(PDB).Some general ideas are here: ["PdbImprovments"]. If you have any sugesstions related to pdb add them there.
 * Write an RPC mechanism, or prepare an existing RPC mechanism, for the standard library.
 * Implement the [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr6/ SCSU] codec.
 * Write a library around pickle that allows developers to version their pickles such that old pickles can still be read even though the code that created them has been refactored, attributes renamed, and other such changes.  (Perhaps not of great interest to the community. --amk)
 * asyncore: There are still people using asyncore, even though Twisted has taken most of the asynchronous-socket mindshare. There's a small test suite for asyncore, but it's far from exercising every method and branch.  A good first step would be to improve the test suite. That would let us fix bugs with less worry about breaking the module.
 * curses: The largest outstanding issue for curses is support for Unicode, or wide characters, or however you write I18N applications with curses.
