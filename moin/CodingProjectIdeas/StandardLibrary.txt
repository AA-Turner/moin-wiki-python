 * CleanupUrlLibProject
 * Cleanup/modernize a module(s) in the stdlib.  
 * The modules which deal with both str and unicode sometimes treat them differently -- which is usually a bug.
 * CompleteSslSupport
 * UnicodeonWindowsExtensions
 * [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0337.html PEP 337]: Logging Support for Standard Library
 * ProfileReplacementProject
 * ../FileSystemVirtualization
 * ../EnhancedIterTools
 * ../ExploreFunctionalProgramming
 * MakeXmlrpclibAsynchronous
 * Add cross compiling support in distutils (and otherwise improve distutils).
 * Work on unit test suite. This includes not only developing support code (such as decorators to flag tests that are implementation-specific, known to fail, etc.), but also to have more code coverage in the unit tests.
 * Improve Python Debugger(PDB).Some of general ideas are here: ["PdbImprovments"].If you have any sugesstions related to pdb add them there.
 * Write an RPC mechanism, or prepare an existing RPC mechanism, for the standard library.
 * Implement the [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr6/ SCSU] codec.
 * Write a library around pickle that allows developers to version their pickles such that old pickles can still be read even though the code that created them has been refactored, attributes renamed, and other such changes.  (Perhaps not of great interest to the community. --amk)
 * ./RestructuredStandardLibrary
