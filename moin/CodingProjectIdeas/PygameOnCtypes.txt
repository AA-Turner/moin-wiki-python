Pygame wraps some SDL libraries (SDL, SDL_Image etc) using C code. It also provides some extra misc. C functions.

Python2.5 will include ctypes in the standard library. SoC 2006 is a good opportunity to recreate the pygame API using ctypes. This will let the average python programmer, who does not work with C, to hack on and extend pygame.

This same work (ctypes conversion) is already happening with PyOpenGL.
