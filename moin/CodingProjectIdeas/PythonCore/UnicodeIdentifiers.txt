Python should support arbitrary letters in identifiers, not just ASCII letters. The implementation should allow Unicode strings as class, function, and attribute names (possibly module names); it should specify what precise characters are allowed for identifiers (following recommendations from the Unicode Consortium). It is likely to appear only in Python 3, but should be able to run on 2.x already.
