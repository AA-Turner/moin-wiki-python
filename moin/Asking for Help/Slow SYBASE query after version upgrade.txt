Python script running long after version upgrade(s) - querying to Sybase, so Sybase Module for Python involved

## Insert your problem description here. You may provide code samples using syntax like this:

During server upgrades/refresh, we have upgrade FROM -> TO below:

RedHat 4.3 (32-bit) -> 5.5 (64-bit) / Python 2.3.4 -> 2.4.3 / Sybase Module for Python (static) 0.39 -> 0.39

After this upgrade, a Python script used to query sybase tables and extract data and load back to RedHat server is taking 6x as long.

Network settings have been compared from original server and new server, and network ports for original and new, all match and FTP transfers have ruled out the network configuration as a problem.  Are there any known bugs/defects in Phython version 2.4.3 that could be resulting in our situation/experience?
