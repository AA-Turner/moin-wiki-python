## page was renamed from How to store information in variable arrays?
How would I store information in variables that I can go back later and compare? Such as 

{{{#!python
x = 1
text = []
while x <= 10:
     text.append(int(raw_input("Enter a number: ")))
     x = x + 1

for x in range(10): 
    print text[x]
}}}

I just need to do this to compare a history to make sure a number hasn't already been entered earlier. But this is just a small example. I get nasty errors. 

Thanks!

edit: that should work now
We initialize a list first with `text = []`.
Then we just append each element to that list.

You can use the `in` operator:

{{{#!python
if number in text:
    print "Number already entered!"
}}}

If you choose to use a set instead of a list...

{{{#!python
text = set()
}}}

...then the above test still works, but you'll use the `add` method on the set when adding numbers, not an `append` method.
