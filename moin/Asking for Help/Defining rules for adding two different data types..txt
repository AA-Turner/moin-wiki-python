I'm a beginner with Python and am trying to create a Complex number class. The problem I am having is as follows, if z is a complex number (or other special type) how can I find 1+z? I am able to handle z+1, but it would be much nicer to have the operation be commutative. Whenever I attempt to compute 1+z I receive a TypeError.
