= Asking for Help: Is there any cross-platform GUI toolkit available for Python 3 apart from Tkinter? =

Hello sir is there any Cross platform GUI toolkit available for python 3? except tkinter.

----

Take a look at the Python2orPython3 page and also the Python3PortingStatus page. The latter links to the following resources:

 * http://getpython3.net/ (doesn't seem to be working as of <<Date(2012-01-06T17:45:58+0100)>>)
 * http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=533 (packages tagged with Python 3 on PyPI)

I suggest browsing the latter of the above resources and selecting things in the "Environment" section. By selecting [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=24&c=533|X11 Applications]], I can see that !PyQt, for example, is available for Python 3. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2012-01-06T17:45:58+0100)>>
