I have a python script which is called from the svn repository hooks folders through a batch file post_commit.bat 
In the batch file in have D:\Test\SVNHook.py %1 %2

The problem arised is stated below
------------------------------------

When i run the python script using IDLE then the svn command is executed and the result is formed as an xml.
The svn command is given below
svn log --verbose --xml file///D:/Repositories/Test -r 65 >> a.xml

The output for the above command is an xml with the log details while running with IDLE only.

            If the file is committed then the SVNHook.py is called but the resultant a.xml doesnot 
have any content. But i can retrieve the repository and revision id on BOTH cases.

Please guide me through this problem.
