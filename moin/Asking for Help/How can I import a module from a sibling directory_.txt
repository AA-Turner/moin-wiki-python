= Asking for Help: How can I import a module from a sibling directory? =

I am new to Python from Java background, I have following structure

{{{
/root
	/folder1
		Class1.py
		Class2.py
	/folder2
		Class3.py
}}}

I am in the folder2 and want to run class3.py but it need to import a module from Class1.py
Could someone please help me?

Answer: I believe you just need to add folder1 to your path variable. Should be something along the lines of...

{{{#!python
import sys
sys.path.append('/root/folder1')
import Class1
}}}

If that doesn't work, look through the documentation for info on how the sys.path variable works -- I may just have the syntax slightly off
