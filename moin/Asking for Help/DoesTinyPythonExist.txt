= Where can I find a tiny python installation (under 2 MB) for an embedded linux system? =

The [[EmbeddedPython|Embedded Python]] page has details of Python runtimes which work in embedded environments. To reach 2MB you may need to work on reducing the footprint of such installations even further, however.

The [[PythonImplementations|Python implementations]] page has details of a range of implementations, some of which emphasise compactness over full compatibility with Python. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-27T00:16:51+0100)>>
