= Asking for Help: Embedding Python core to iOS application =

I trying to make minimal part of Python to work as part (static library) of my iOS application for internal scripting. I used configure under Mac OS X(10.7) and it was successful.
Then I got compilable and linkable XCode project very fast.
The problem is, when I trying to use Python by 
Py_NoSiteFlag=1;
Py_Initialize();
it fails with error "Fatal Python error: exceptions bootstrapping error." inside _PyExc_Init().
I tried to debug it, but unfortunately I cant understand why it fails. May be bacause I noob in Python source, but anyway, I need to port it. Tried 2.7.3, or latest 3.x, it was the same result as above. 
Any solution or hint will be very helpful.

Best Regards,
Dmitry Stepanushkin
