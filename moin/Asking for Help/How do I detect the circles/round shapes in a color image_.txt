Hello everybody!

I just installed the python-opencv package on Ubuntu 10.10 and I was wondering how I can use it to detect the circles/round figures in an RGB image.
I am not an expert in images and I do not know what terms like HSV and 8-bit image mean(I know these two now, of course).

I tried this code, which I adapted from a website, and it doesn't work:
{{{#!python

import cv
	
def main():
	
	storage = cv.CreateMemStorage(0)
	
	im = cv.LoadImageM("Proba1.jpg")
	size = (640, 480)
	hsv_im = cv.CreateImage(size, cv.IPL_DEPTH_8U, 3)
	thresholded = cv.CreateImage(size, cv.IPL_DEPTH_8U, 1)
	thresholded2 = cv.CreateImage(size, cv.IPL_DEPTH_8U, 1)
	 
	hsv_min = cv.Scalar(0, 50, 170, 0)
	hsv_max = cv.Scalar(10, 180, 256, 0)
	hsv_min2 = cv.Scalar(170, 50, 170, 0)
	hsv_max2 = cv.Scalar(256, 180, 256, 0)
	
	cv.CvtColor(im, hsv_im, cv.CV_BGR2HSV)
	cv.InRangeS(im, hsv_min, hsv_max, thresholded)
	cv.InRangeS(im, hsv_min2, hsv_max2, thresholded2)
	cv.cvOr(thresholded, thresholded2, thresholded)
	# pre-smoothing improves Hough detector
	cv.Smooth(im, im, cv.CV_GAUSSIAN, 9, 9)
	
	
	circles = cv.HoughCircles(im, im, cv.CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT, 2, thresholded.height/4, 100, 40, 20, 200)
	
	
if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()

}}}

The error I get is: OpenCV Error: Sizes of input arguments do not match () in cvCvtColor, file /build/buildd/opencv-2.1.0/src/cv/cvcolor.cpp, line 2208OpenCV Error: Sizes of input arguments do not match () in cvCvtColor, file /build/buildd/opencv-2.1.0/src/cv/cvcolor.cpp, line 2208

I really do NOT understand the whole code above(not the error, the code) since there is no good documentation about opencv and python available.
I also tried installing pyopencv but it didn't work.

I would be very glad if someone could show me a code sample that takes a .jpg image, makes it 8-bit(because this is another error it gives me) and detects the circles in it. It would also be nice if you could tell me a good opencv tutorial for python.

Thanks for your time and interest and sorry for my grammar.
