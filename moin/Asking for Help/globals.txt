The following puzzles me:
Both a and b are globals. Both are assigned an initial value in fun(). But b is considered unassigned in fun1().

## Insert your problem description here. You may provide code samples using syntax like this:
## {{{#!python
## def fun():
    global a,b
    a = [0]*1
    b = 0
    fun1()

def fun1():
    a[0] += 1
    print('a[0]: ', a[0])
    b += 1
    print('b: ', b)


fun()

 b += 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment
## }}}
