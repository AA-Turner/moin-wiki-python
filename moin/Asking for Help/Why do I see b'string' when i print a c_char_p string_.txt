I was trying to use ctypes to get Windows clipboard contents and the value that gets returned is a ctypes.c_char_p string.  When I print it the string looks like b'contents_of_clipboard'.  I am not sure why this happens or how to get rid of it.  anyone know.  The code that I pilfered from the net to do this is below
{{{#!python
import ctypes, sys

def winGetClipboard():
	ctypes.windll.user32.OpenClipboard(0)
	pcontents = ctypes.windll.user32.GetClipboardData(1) # 1 is CF_TEXT
	data = ctypes.c_char_p(pcontents).value
	ctypes.windll.user32.CloseClipboard()
	return data
}}}

If I had Hello World on the clipboard the returned output would be''' b'Hello World' '''
