readline under ms windows

## Insert your problem description here. You may provide code samples using syntax like this:
## {{{#!python
## Hello, guys.
First of all thanks for the Python. I think it's the most beautiful scripting language for today.

Actually I'm a Linux user, and believe, that under Linux I won't have such problem, but for a while Linux is inaccessible for me.

I'm writing little console application, and it would be great to have auto-completion feature. As I understood it could be made through readline module functions, but there is no readline under MS.

What can you suggest? (migration on linux isn't an option %)
