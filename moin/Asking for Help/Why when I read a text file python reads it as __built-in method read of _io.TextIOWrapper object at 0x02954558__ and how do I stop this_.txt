I am writing a program that uses text files to store user information like their name and password.  I am using this information to check login info against the info they have provided.  This never worked so I decided to do a simple open files program to find the problem.

{{{#!python
f = open('test.txt', 'r')
a = f.read
f.close
print(a)
}}}
and when I ran it on Idle it printed:
<built-in method read of _io.TextIOWrapper object at 0x02954558>
Instead of what I had in my text file.  Does anyone know why this is happening or how to stop it?
