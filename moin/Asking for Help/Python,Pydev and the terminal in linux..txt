Im a begginer in python and pydev. I recently made the "helloworld" program in Pydev.
My question is: how do i execute it or open it from the interactive python mode (in the linux terminal)
I tried many cmd's , like ./hello.py, import hello.py, python hello.py, but the only thing i got was SyntaxError: invalid syntax, or some other error.
also, i have another question. When do we use chmod +x? every time i write it in pydev, i get a X in the left , that means its incorrect. Something like this: X chmod +x.
