= Asking for Help: I'm taking an unhandled threading exception that I've been unable to locate =

I keep getting this unhandled exception, but I believe I have placed try except statements in all my threads.  Any thoughts?

{{{
Unhandled exception in thread started by <bound method Thread.__bootstrap of <Thread(Thread-169204, stopped 1004)>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python27\lib\threading.py", line 503, in __bootstrap

    del _limbo[self]
KeyError: <Thread(Thread-169204, stopped 1004)>

A philosophical discussion appears to be appropriate here.  How in fact does one get one's self out of _limbo? The answer my friend is blowing in the wind. The answer is ...

Posted this question about a week ago and noone has answered.  Not sure if anyone is paying attention to the Asking for Help portion of the wiki. Just to make sure that I know exactly how long its been on the wiki today's date is 3/22/2011. The wiki indicated that my question was sent to MatsWichmann, SkipMontanaro, FredDrake. Do these guys really exist?

{{{#!wiki note
Yes, I really exist.  So do Fred and Mats.   (I have even met Fred before.)  I subscribe to all pages of the wiki mostly to revert spam introduced into it, not to answer questions.  Personally, of all the uses one could think of for a wiki, asking and answering long-form help questions seems to me like just about the worst use possible.  I ignore essentially all questions posted here unless it looks like someone is spamming this subtree of the wiki.  -- SkipMontanaro

Those guys get mails about updates to this page, yes. I did have a look at the `threading` module, but I have to admit that I am not really familiar with its architecture. There's a comment in the `__bootstrap` method which claims that exceptions thrown by "daemon threads" are meant to be ignored, but it looks like you're experiencing a problem with the actual administration of threads done by the module itself - that is, you aren't supposed to be concerned by the `_limbo` dictionary - and maybe there's a bug involved. I can only find Issue:7264 which mentions `_limbo`, however. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-22T23:55:34+0100)>>

Skip and Paul,

Thanks for responding.  Is there a better place to post my question? Where might that be?
