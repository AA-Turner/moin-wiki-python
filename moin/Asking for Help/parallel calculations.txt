Hi,


I was wondering which module I should use to parallelise my calculations. In fact I have two Monte Carlo models. Parameters for the models come from a python file but the models do not change the file. They just read some variables and a description of an object to create instances of the object. Each model takes a minimum of 5 minutes of calculation time. And I want to decrease the time and to launch the models in parallel. As far as I understand if I use threading module it will create two threads but because of GIL they will be executed consequently. Am I right? Could you please give me an advice on this?


Thank you! Maxim
