How can I add or substract two to the last digit of a float? Like 4.9999 should be 5.0001 or 4.9997. The problem is  

{{{
>>> 4.9999
4.9999000000000002
would yield 4.9999000000000000 or 4.9999000000000004 which is not right.
I could make a str(4.9999), convert each character to an int and work on each character from right   
to left, but there must be a better way.
this is not what I want as well:
>>> ( 4.9999 * 10000 + 2 ) / 10000.0
5.0000999999999998 -> this should be 5.0001
this makes it somehow :))
>>> str(( 4.9999 * 10000 + 2 ) / 10000)
'5.0001'
}}}
