This page is aimed to be the starting point of collection for ideas for projects which could benefit the Python community,
either projects that help the Python core, develop the standard library, third party packages, or more.
The list below is in no way comprehensive or the only projects ideas that are acceptable!  If you have an idea that is not listed that is fine; please submit a proposal for your idea!

This page was created to foster collaboration on ideas regarding projects that could be done as part of the [http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html Google Summer of Code].

There is a related page to discuss the ./MentorshipCoordination side of the project.

We've created a [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2006 new mailing list] to discuss the Google Summer of Code from a Python POV.  It is strongly encouraged people interested in discussing possible projects, people who'd be willing to help students this summer as mentors, and any students considering applying for the program to join and start discussions on that list.

Ideally, each project should be expanded into a more full-featured description, so that people can judge the value, the effort involved, the size of the project (takes a week, takes a month, etc.), who knows enough about the project to help out, etc.

(Formatting:
 * Topics with a paragraph or so of thought, start new a page with a . in front of the wiki word, i.e. {{{ ./CleanupUrlLibProject}}} to scope the new pages a bit
 * for topics not fleshed out beyond a sentence or two, indent the sentence six spaces on a newline below the topic title/summary; this is to make sure that the description does not overpower the title/summary
)

 * SimpleTodo:  finite projects that improve (maybe just clean up) part of Python's implementation.
 * ./PythonCore
 * ./StandardLibrary
 * ["./Libraries"]
 * ./PythonWebProgrammingIdeas
 * JythonProjects
      Port IDLE from tk to swing, OS X improvements.  
 * Port standard library modules implemented in C to Python
      This is basically what the PyPy project is doing.  See their site for more details on what parts of the Python standard library have not yet been translated.

 * ./PythonDocInOpenEbook
 * fix some old, old bugs in sourceforge
     This is not a high profile, totally new idea, but maybe even helps the community more than founding another web framework
 * A better way to create (singlefile) executables by bringing the advantages of py2exe and McMillans compiler together.
    Note that the next version of py2exe will allow this - it's 95% finished in CVS already -- theller.
    Don't forget [http://starship.python.net/crew/atuining/cx_Freeze/ cx_Freeze] which has a lot of nice properties too.
    For Windows, Linux and Irix also look at [http://pyinstaller.hpcf.upr.edu PyInstaller].
 * Enhance the Python catalog of modules
     http://www.python.org/pypi -- contact [http://www.python.org/sigs/catalog-sig/ Catalog-SIG] for more.
  * ratings (both automatic and user)
  * admin interfaces
  * new pydotorg look and feel
  * fix and implement PEP 345
