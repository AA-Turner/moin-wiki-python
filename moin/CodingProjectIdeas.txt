This page is aimed to be the starting point of collection for ideas for projects which could benefit the Python community,
either projects that help the Python core, develop the standard library, third party packages, or more.

This page was created to foster collaboration on ideas regarding projects that could be done as part of the [http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html Google Summer of Code].

Ideally, each project below should be expanded into a more full-featured description, so that people can judge the value, the effort involved, the size of the project (takes a week, takes a month, etc.), who knows enough about the project to help out, etc.

 * CleanupUrlLibProject
 * ProfileReplacementProject
 * JythonProjects (not sure what exactly)
 * Unicode on Windows extensions: add unicode returning versions of sys.argv and os.environ; unicode accepting functions for running processes like os.popen*, os.system, os.exec*. After experience implementing some of these, the implementer should look at ways to simplify coding functions that take either unicode or byte strings. The existing unicode method implementations such as open do not work in 32 bit unicode string builds so this could be fixed along with finding a way to make coding extension functions for either 16 or 32 bit wide unicode strings easier. -- Neil
 * Python web programming -- I don't have anything specific in mind, though there's a huge number of interesting projects I could come up with, mostly centering around [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html WSGI] applications and middleware, or [http://pythonpaste.org Paste] (which in practice is nearly the same thing).  Or you can come up with something yourself; either way, I'm open for advising -- IanBicking
