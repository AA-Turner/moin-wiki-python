This page is aimed to be the starting point of collection for ideas for projects which could benefit the Python community,
either projects that help the Python core, develop the standard library, third party packages, or more.

Ideally, each project below should be expanded into a more full-featured description, so that people can judge the value, the effort involved, the size of the project (takes a week, takes a month, etc.), who knows enough about the project to help out, etc.

* CleanupUrlLibProject
* ProfileReplacementProject
* JythonProjects (not sure what exactly)
