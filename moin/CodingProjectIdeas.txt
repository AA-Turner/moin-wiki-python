This page is aimed to be the starting point of collection for ideas for projects which could benefit the Python community,
either projects that help the Python core, develop the standard library, third party packages, or more.

This page was created to foster collaboration on ideas regarding projects that could be done as part of the [http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html Google Summer of Code].

Ideally, each project below should be expanded into a more full-featured description, so that people can judge the value, the effort involved, the size of the project (takes a week, takes a month, etc.), who knows enough about the project to help out, etc.

 * CleanupUrlLibProject
 * CompleteSslSupport
 * ProfileReplacementProject
 * MakeXmlrpclibAsynchronous
 * Add a MemoryUsageProfiler to python. Currently it is almost impossible to figure out where memory is going in a large python program, especially if you have C extensions loaded. It'd be nice to know where the memory is going, if there are circular references, or if objects are being held too long.
 * JythonProjects (not sure what exactly)
 * Unicode on Windows extensions: add unicode returning versions of sys.argv and os.environ; unicode accepting functions for running processes like os.popen*, os.system, os.exec*. After experience implementing some of these, the implementer should look at ways to simplify coding functions that take either unicode or byte strings. The existing unicode method implementations such as open do not work in 32 bit unicode string builds so this could be fixed along with finding a way to make coding extension functions for either 16 or 32 bit wide unicode strings easier. -- Neil
