=== Description of Mailman3Sprint ===

I'm proposing a Mailman3 coding sprint at Pycon.  I currently have a chunk of working code in my private cvs respository.  It is, however incomplete.  The most important thing to do at the sprint is to review and if necessary modify the APIs to the databases and other system components.  Then, as time allows, implement enough of the missing pieces to get basic but end-to-end functionality working.

My goal would be to get the code to an un-embarrassing enough place that we could check it into the public cvs.

Currently Mailman3 uses Twisted, ZPT, ZConfig, and a few other Zope3 components such as interfaces, pagetemplates, tal, and tales.  Some of these are fairly old and could use updating (e.g. Twisted is still at 1.0.5).  The rest of the code is new, taking a cue from Mailman 2.1 but with updates to take advantage of Python 2.3 features.
