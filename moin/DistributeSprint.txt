In order to continue the effort started in distutils-ML. We are organizing a distutils PEP sprint this thirsday with
people that works differently to deliver Python applications.

 * using virtualenv
 * using zc.buildout/setuptools      
 * using scons
 * using the debian packaging system

If you want to join, please do !

 * Where: remote sprint, #distutils on freenode
 * When (proposed date) : 
   * Thursday, 2 oct. 9 a.m. CEST
   * Friday, 2 oct. 9 a.m. CEST
   * Saturday, 2 oct. 9 a.m. CEST

= Participants =

name / skills / desired date

 * Tarek Ziad√© / zc.buildout, some distutils and setuptools internals / Any of the three dates
 * 


= Tasks that will be covered =

 * make a synthesis of all the threads that have discussed distutils previously

 * work on the Python Metadata definition (PEP 345, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345)
 and see if some improvments could be done in it.

 * work on a proposal to see how these metadata could be defined in the package,
 besides setup.py, and let external tools read them.

 * work on a proposal to structure the content of packages

 * list the problems in compilation matters and work on a proposal to improve it

= Desired output =

We would like to come up with enough material to write a meta-PEP and a series
of PEP. These PEPs will then be submitted in the distutils-SIG mailing list for further
discussions.
