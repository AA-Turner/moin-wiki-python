= Cloud PyPI - Mirroring PyPI in the cloud =

== Idea ==

We are setting up a PyPI mirror of the static content of PyPI in Amazon CloudFront.

== Proposal ==

 * [[CloudPyPI/Proposal]]

The proposal was accepted by the PSF in their December 2010 board meeting.

Funding was limited to an initial USD 500 for Amazon costs to see whether the project would succeed.

== Resources ==

 * [[CheeseShopDev|Developer Intro to the PyPI code]]

 * [[PyPiXmlRpc|PyPI RPC interface]] (which we likely won't use, but gives an idea of how the meta data is stored)

 * [[https://svn.python.org/packages/trunk/pypi/|PyPI Code]]

 * [[https://svn.python.org/packages/trunk/pypi/webui.py| Web GUI code]]
