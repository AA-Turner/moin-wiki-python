Wing IDE is a powerful development environment for the Python programming language.

See http://www.wingide.com/

If you are working on Free or Open``Source projects, I have heard that you can get a free license to WingIDE. I don't know if this is for WingIDE Lite, or the full version.

WingIDE allows you to debug CGI scripts, and presumably other remote scripts.

It has a code browser, syntax coloring, code completion, and step-by-step debugging as well.
