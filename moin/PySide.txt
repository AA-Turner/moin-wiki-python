'''PySide''' is LGPL-licensed Python bindings for the Qt (framework for cross-platform UI and applications). PySide is currently maintaineed by the Qt company, under the name "Qt for Python".

PySide bindings allow both free open source and proprietary software development and ultimately aim to support all of the platforms as Qt itself.
