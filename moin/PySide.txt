'''PySide''' is LGPL-licensed Python bindings for the Qt (framework for cross-platform UI and applications). PySide itself is a community managed Qt Project.

PySide bindings allow both free open source and proprietary software development and ultimately aim to support all of the platforms as Qt itself.
