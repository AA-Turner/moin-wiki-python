This page describes various things  I want to try with a candidate tracker.

 * Sign in as a developer and file a bug.
 * File an anonymous bug, if possible.
 * Reclassify a bug as a feature request.
 * Attach a text file of output.
 * Attach a screenshot.
 * Attach a patch fixing a bug.

 * Search for all curses bugs.

 * Close a bug as "won't fix".
 * Close a bug as fixed.

 * View a list of all 2.4 bugs.
 * Reassign a bug to the 2.5 category.

 * Comment on a bug and receive an e-mail about the comment.
