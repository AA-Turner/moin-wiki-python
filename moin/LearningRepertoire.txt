= Repertoire of Building Blocks for Learning Programming =

Here are collected raw materials for new programmers to be able to quickly do something with Python, the building blocks with which to construct their solution.  Their success is built on three things - the language, the library of modules and access to data elements, as needed.

These building blocks should be easy to find, easy to install, documented to a degree sufficient for new programmers and free of licensing hassles.  In many cases these blocks take care of low-level details so the programmer can focus on the problem at hand.
