= String Formatting =

The [http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html section of the manual on String Formatting Operations] is hidden in the section on [http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq.html Sequence types.]

== Direct Variable Reference ==

A common trick you can use when writing strings is to refer directly to variables.

{{{
#!python
a = "hello, world!"
x = 34
y = 96

print """
a = %(a)s
x,y = (%(x)s,%(y)s)
""" % vars() # local variables
}}}

If you want to refer to global variables, you can replace {{{vars()}}} with {{{globals()}}}.

== Printing Percentages ==

{{{
#!python
percent = lambda x:"%2.2f%%" % x

print percent(35.3567) # prints "35.35%"
}}}
