= Creating a Python Extension Module from Scratch =

This guide will take you through the process of creating a Python extension module. It is assumed that you have a recent Python version (2.4 or later) and setuptools installed.

We'll be creating a project called 'exam' (short for 'example'.)

=== Step 1: Create the project directory ===

{{{> mkdir exam
> cd exam
}}}

=== Step 2: Create the setup.py script ===

In the directory you just created, make a new file, setup.py containing the following:
{{{#!python
from setuptools import setup, Extension

setup(
    # Name of this package
    name="exam",
    
    # Package version
    version=0.1,
    
    # This tells setup how to find our unit tests.
    test_suite = "test.exam_unittest",
    
    # Describes how to build the actual extension module from C source files.
    ext_modules = [
        Extension(
          'exam',         # Python name of the module
          ['src/exam.c']  # Source files to build
        )]
    )}}}

The {{{setup.py}}} file tells Python how to compile, test, and install your extension module.

=== Step 3: Create the module source file ===

This will be located in the location specified in the {{{setup.py}}} script given above; in this example, the location is {{{exam/src/exam.c}}}. This file will contain the following:

{{{#!cplusplus
#include <Python.h>

PyMODINIT_FUNC initexam(void)
{
    PyObject *m;
    
    m = Py_InitModule( "exam", NULL );
}
}}}

As you can see, this is a pretty minimal extension module - it does nothing but establish that there is, in fact, a module. We'll add more to this later, but for now, let's just see if we can get it to compile and run.

=== Step 4: Create the unit test module ===

Create an empty __init.py__ file in exam/test.

{{{>mkdir test
> touch test/__init__.py
}}}

=== Step 5: Create the unit test source file ===

This will be located in {{{exam/test/exam_unittest.py}}}. This file will contain the following.

{{{#!python
import unittest
import doctest

class DeviceTest( unittest.TestCase ):
    # This is a simple test that just tries to load the module
    def runTest( self ):
        try:
            import exam
        except ImportError, e:
            self.Fail( str( e ) )
}}}

The {{{setup.py}}} will automatically scan this file for unit test cases (subclasses of {{{unittest.TestCase}}}).

At this point, your directory structure should look like this:
{{{
exam/
  setup.py
  src/
    exam.c
  test/
    __init__.py
    exam_unittest.py
}}}

=== Step 6: Build and test the module ===

{{{
> python setup.py test
}}}

If everything is correct, your extension module should have built, and you should see a message on the console telling you that your unit test has passed.
