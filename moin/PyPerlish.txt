Harry George's
[http://www.seanet.com/~hgg9140/comp/pyperlish-1.2/doc/index.html pyperlish]
provides perl idioms in python.

This perhaps makes it easier for perl programmers to transition to python,
as they don't need to relearn everything at once.

Unfortunately, development of pyperlish seems to have stopped in 2001,
as Harry completed his own spin-up on python idioms.

The advantages of reducing the barrier to entry for potential python
programmers seems worth a bit of odd perlish code during their learning
process.  No?

Idiom translation dictionaries, such as
[http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyFromOtherLanguages RubyFromOtherLanguages],
are another approach to this issue.
