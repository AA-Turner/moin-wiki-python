[http://www.seanet.com/~hgg9140/comp/pyperlish-1.2/doc/index.html pyperlish]
provides perl idioms in python.
([http://www.seanet.com/~hgg9140/comp/#L002 download page])

This perhaps makes it easier for perl programmers to transition to python,
as they don't need to relearn everything at once.

The advantages of reducing the barrier to entry for potential python
programmers seems worth a bit of odd perlish code during their learning
process.  No?

Idiom translation dictionaries, such as
[http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyFromOtherLanguages RubyFromOtherLanguages],
are another approach to this issue.

Development of pyperlish stopped in 2001,
as the author completed his own spin-up on python idioms.
Anyone who wants to grab it, is welcome to it.

pyperlish was formerly called pyperl, before the current pyperl
grabbed the name.
