Python style conventions are described in PEPs.
 * [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html PEP 8] -- Style Guide for Python Code
 * [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html PEP 257] -- Docstring Conventions

== Learning Python Style ==

If you're anything like me, you probably can't just read PEP 8 & 257, and start writing perfect Python style.

I've had a lot of success learning (and applying) the document in steps. Start with your line width, spacings. Then work on imports, white space, ... Continue learning and applying the style in ''steps.''

It is probably unrealistic to believe that you can get the whole thing at once.

= Discussion =

I wish there were good examples of well-styled Python code! (Most Python modules do ''not'' follow Python style guidelines!)

I intend to write some examples here, and comment on the features of the formatting. Hopefully, people who understand the format better will correct the examples.
