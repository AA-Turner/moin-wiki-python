Python style conventions are described in PEPs.

== Learning Python Style ==

If you're anything like me, you probably can't just read PEP 8 & 257, and start writing perfect Python style.

I've had a lot of success learning (and applying) the document in steps. Start with your line width, spacings. Then work on imports, white space, ... Continue learning and applying the style in ''steps.''

It is probably unrealistic to believe that you can get the whole thing at once.

== Examples ==

I wish there were good examples of well-styled Python code! (Most Python modules do ''not'' follow Python style guidelines!)

I intend to write some examples here, and comment on the features of the formatting. Hopefully, people who understand the format better will correct the examples.

=== Example Module ===

This is my understanding of how a Python module by PEP-8 might look:

{{{
#!python
"""Short description of module.

Blah blah blah. This is the long description of the module. More brief
explanations.

ClassNameA --  short description
function_a --  short description
function_b --  short description
"""

import sys  # standard library imports
import os

import optparse  # related major package imports

import eggs  # application specific imports
import spam


class ClassNameA:

    """What it is.

    Notes on what it is and how it does it.

    Lots to say, lots to say.  I'm unclear on whether we need two spaces
    between sentences or not.  72 characters wide.  Blah blah blah.

    Document methods in here, with a short explanation.

    eat_eggs --  does X
    eat_spam --  does Y
    """

    def __init__(self, green_eggs, green_spam):
        """Init ClassNameA with some eggs and spam."""
        foo()
        bar()
        baz()

    def eat_eggs(self):
        """One line documentation is like this."""
        foo()
        bar()

    def eat_spam(self):
        """Short explanation.

        Multi-line spam has a one line description at top, seperated by
        a space, and then more multi-line spam afterwards.  Note that
        the final triple-quote appears beneath.
        """
        baz()

    def _internal_use(self):
        # Eat eggs and spam.
        #
        # Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but you
        # should have a comment that describes what the method does.
        # This comment should appear after the "def" line.

        self.eat_eggs()
        self.eat_spam()


def function_a(eggs, ham):
    """A function_a is a foobar.

    Again, multi-line rules apply in here as well, the same way.  Note
    that we have two spaces between module-level class and function
    definitions.  That's PEP-8 at work.
    """
    foo()
    bar()
    baz()


def function_b(eggs, ham):
    """A function_b is a foobar.

    Another one.  Still two spaces separating functions and classes.
    """
    foo()
    bar()
    baz()


}}}

This may be incorrect; please correct it if you know better.

In particular, I'm not sure if there are zero, one, or two spaces between the module docstring, and the import lines.

I know these PEPs make no mention of ''DocTest'' code in docstrings.  However, some of them might be nice in this
example.

(-- JimD)

Wow, I didn't even ''know'' about DocTest.

That's really interesting.

Do you know of good example uses of doctest that I can look at?

This is the first I heard about it, even though I can see that it's been there for a while.

todo:

 * show a method with a reallly long docstring; those docstrings have a blank line between them and the "def" line (PEP 257)
 * show methods with arguments and interesting return data- "The docstring for a function or method should summarize its behavior and document its arguments, return value(s), side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when it can be called (all if applicable). Optional arguments should be indicated. It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface." (PEP 257)
