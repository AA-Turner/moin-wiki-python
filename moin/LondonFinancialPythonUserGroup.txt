The London Financial Python User Group (affectionately, LFPUG) has been started in November 2009. Over the last several years, the Python/Numpy/Scipy toolset has steadily grown in popularity among quants. It now plays an important role in the trading and visualization systems throughout the financial industry.  A number of London-based quants, traders, and other financial professionals have asked Enthought to set up a “Financial Python” user group.

Beginning in November 2009, Enthought started to organize a monthly event where people can meet and discuss Python’s use in the financial sector (best practices, new technologies, etc.).

If you’d like to be kept informed about the details of these events, join us on the [[http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2428849| LinkedIn group]] or contact Didrik (dpinte@enthought.com) by e-mail.
