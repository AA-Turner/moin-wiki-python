= Writing Exception Classes =

Exception classes are not special, you just derive them from Exception:

{{{
#!python
class HostNotFound(Exception):
    def __init__(self, host):
        self.host = host
        super(HostNotFound, self)('Host Not Found exception: missing %s' % host)
}}}

You may later write:

{{{
#!python
try:
    raise HostNotFound("taoriver.net")
except HostNotFound, exc:
    # Handle exception.
    print exc  # -> 'Host Not Found exception: missing taoriver.net'
    print exc.host  # -> 'taoriver.net'
    
}}}

== Questions ==

  * How do you relay the traceback information? ''Relay the traceback information? Moving it higher up the call-stack? Could you try to explain your question?''
     * When you're logging exceptions, you want access to the traceback information to. After some research, I believe what you use is extract_tb or extract_stack from the traceback module. -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2003-09-07T15:23:43Z)]]

  ''Look at cgitb for how to do detailed TB introspection, and as an example of why mixing logic and (HTML) layout is a very bad thing.''

  * What better exception-foo is out there?
