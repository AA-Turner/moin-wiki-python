= Writing Exception Classes =

I (LionKimbro) don't know much about writing exception classes; Here's hoping someone rewrites this better.

Exception classes are not special, you just derive them from Exception:

{{{
#!python
class HostNotFound(Exception):
    def __init__( self, host ):
        self.host = host
        Exception.__init__(self, 'Host Not Found exception: missing %s' % host)
}}}

You may later write:

{{{
#!python
try:
    raise HostNotFound( "taoriver.net" )
except HostNotFound, X:
    # Handle exception.
    # "X" is the HostNotFound instance.
}}}

  * How do you relay the traceback information? ''Relay the traceback information? Moving it higher up the call-stack? Could you try to explain your question?''
     * When you're logging exceptions, you want access to the traceback information to. After some research, I believe what you use is extract_tb or extract_stack from the traceback module. -- 216.254.10.130 [[DateTime(2003-09-07T15:23:43Z)]]
  * What better exception-foo is out there?
