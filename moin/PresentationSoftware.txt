Here is some useful stuff to help prepare your next awesome Python talk.

 * http://slides.html5rocks.com/ - slides using latest HTML5 technologies

Not in Python, but a good stuff anyway:

 * http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js - Prezi clone in CSS3
 * https://github.com/schacon/showoff
 * https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js

 * http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/ (it looks like https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert is able to convert IPython notebooks into this format)
