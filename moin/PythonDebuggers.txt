||Name ||Platforms ||Notes ||
||[[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb|pudb]] ||Unix, Mac OS X ||A visual, console-based, full-screen debugger, designed as a more comfortable drop-in replacement for pdb. (also supports IPython) PdbRcIdea All A .pdbrc for Pyhon's standard debugger, pdb, which allows you to run arbitrary Python commands on pdb startup. ||
||HAP Python Remote Debugger ||Windows ||A python IDE with remote debugging capability. Winpdb and Rpdb2 Unix,Linux,Windows an advanced python debugger, with support for smart breakpoints, multiple threads, namespace modification, embedded debugging, encrypted communication and speed of up to 20 times that of pdb. ||
||rpdb (offline) ||Unix,Windows,Mac OS X ||(predecessor of rpdb2 and winpdb) rpdb.py improves pdb.py's usability and adds support for remote debugging, multiple threads debugging, post mortem of unhandled exceptions, and for debugging of embedded scripts. ||
||JpyDbg ||Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows ||both a CPYTHON and a JPYTHON(JYTHON) debugging framework which has been integrated inside Jedit as a standard jedit plugin. ||
||pydb ||Unix, Windows, Mac OS X ||An expanded version of the pdb loosely based on the gdb command set. The debugger supports thread debugging, signal handling, non-interactive tracing, and much more. Xpdb Unix pdb extension with curses module that adds console window with source code. ||
||[[http://code.google.com/p/pydbgr|trepan2]], [[http://code.google.com/p/python-trepan|trepan3k]] ||Unix, Windows, Mac OS X ||A rewrite of pydb with closer compliance to gdb . In addition to the features of pydb, the debugger supports syntax coloring (via pygments), has extensive on-line help (in rendered [[reStructuredText]]), command completion, a smarter eval, debugger macros written in Python, and more. ||
||DDD ||Unix ||DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, GNU Make debugger, or the Python debugger. DDD displays data structures as graphs and plots. A deprecated version of pydb comes with this package. For GNU make debugging, use ddd-test5 ||
||pyDebug ||Unix,Windows ||Debugger for Python programs with a graphical user interface. It is inherited from "bdb" but uses a GUI and has some powerful features like object browser, windows for variables, classes, functions, exceptions, stack, conditional breakpoints, etc. ||
||gdb ||Unix ||See DebuggingWithGdb Pyclewn *nix, Windows Pyclewn allows using Vim as a front end to a debugger. Pyclewn currently supports gdb and pdb. ||


||||||<tablewidth="85%"style="text-align:center">'''IDE's with debug capabilities''' ||
||Name ||Platforms ||Notes ||
||Komodo IDE ||Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || ||
||PyCharm ||Mac OS X, Linux, Windows ||PyCharm's integrated debugger works for Python and Jython, supports debugging of multiple threads, remote debugging, allows debugging Django, Google App Engine applications and unit tests. The debugger features various breakpoints, stepping modes, frames view, watches, evaluate expression tool and a debug console. Conditional and Exception breakpoint types are available for more precise control. Debug console allows executing any Python statements in the context of the process being debugged while stopped at a breakpoint. ||
||PyScripter ||Windows || ||
||Pyshield ||Linux, Windows ||An IDE tool used to edit, debug Python scripts, publish encrypted scripts, build a standalone executable file, and make installation in various forms(.msi, .tar.gz, .rpm, .zip, .tar.bz2). It includes an editor simulating Emacs python-mode, a GUI debugger simulating GDB, a project view used to manage scripts, modules, extensions, packages and platform specific data files. ||
||Python Tools for Visual Studio ||Windows ||Supports Python (any implementation w/ sufficient sys.settrace capabilities) and IronPython .NET debugging. Includes MPI cluster debugging, breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, locals, watch, and immediate windows, step into/out/over, break on exception, and break on unhandled exception. ||


||||||<tablewidth="85%"style="text-align:center">'''Special-purpose tools''' ||
||Name ||Platforms ||Notes ||
||PyConquer(pythontracer) ||? ||Any Trace hook logger which outputs each thread in its own "swimlane" to make multithreaded analysis easier. Can also time calls (naively) and watch variables. ||
||FirePython ||GoogleAppEngine + Firefox ||"FirePython is a python logger console integrated into Firebug (similar to FirePHP)". See http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/firepython-logger-console-inside-firebug/ ||
