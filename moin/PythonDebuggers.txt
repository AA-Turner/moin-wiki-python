=== Debuggers ===

||<tablestyle="width: 100%">'''Name''' || '''Platform''' || '''   Notes   ''' ||
|| [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb|pudb]] || Unix,Mac OS X|| A visual, console-based, full-screen debugger, designed as a more comfortable drop-in replacement for pdb. (also supports IPython) ||
|| PdbRcIdea || All || A .pdbrc for Pyhon's standard debugger, pdb,  which allows you to run arbitrary Python commands on pdb startup.||
|| [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/hapdebugger/|HAP Python Remote Debugger]] || Windows || A python IDE with remote debugging capability.||
|| [[http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/|Winpdb and Rpdb2]] || Unix,Linux,Windows || an advanced python debugger, with support for smart breakpoints, multiple threads, namespace modification, embedded debugging, encrypted communication and speed of up to 20 times that of pdb.||
|| [[http://rpdb.digitalpeers.com|rpdb]] (offline) || Unix,Windows,Mac OS X|| (predecessor of rpdb2 and winpdb) rpdb.py improves pdb.py's usability and adds support for remote debugging, multiple threads debugging, post mortem of unhandled exceptions, and for debugging of embedded scripts.||
|| [[http://jpydbg.sourceforge.net/|JpyDbg]] || Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows || both a CPYTHON and a JPYTHON(JYTHON) debugging framework which has been integrated inside Jedit as a standard jedit pluggin.||
|| [[http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/pydb|pydb]] || Unix, Windows, OS X || An expanded version of the pdb loosely based on the gdb command set. The debugger supports thread debugging, signal handling, non-interactive tracing, and much more.||
|| [[http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/xpdb.html|Xpdb]] || Unix || pdb extension with '''curses''' module that adds console window with source code. ||
|| [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/|DDD]] || Unix || DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, GNU Make debugger, or the Python debugger. DDD displays data structures as graphs and plots. A deprecated version of pydb comes with this package. For GNU make debugging, use [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61395&package_id=65341|ddd-test5]]||
|| [[http://web.archive.org/web/20040331032128/home.t-online.de/home/Ulrich.Herold/pydebug.py|pyDebug]] || Unix,Windows || Debugger for Python programs with a graphical user interface. It is inherited from "bdb" but uses a GUI and has some powerful features like object browser, windows for variables, classes, functions, exceptions, stack, conditional breakpoints, etc.||
|| gdb || *nix || See DebuggingWithGdb ||

=== IDEs with Debug Capabilities ===

|| [[http://pydev.org|PyDev]] || Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || Allows debugging multiple threads in Jython and Python (It is featured as a 'Python IDE' plugin for Eclipse).||
|| [[http://wingware.com/|Wing IDE]] || Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || An IDE that can debug multiple threads in code launched from the IDE or code launched externally, running under CPython and Stackless Python.  The GUI includes a Debug Probe, which is a Python shell running in the context of the paused debug process.  The IDE's debugger also features value watching (by symbolic path, object reference, or a combination), conditional breakpoints, debugging of tests running in the integrated unit testing tool, special support for Zope2 and Plone, and How-Tos for debugging Turbogears, Django, Google App Engine, wxWidgets, PyQt, Tkinter, CGIs, and many other packages.||
|| [[http://activestate.com/komodo/features/|Komodo IDE]] || Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || ||
|| [[http://jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/|PyCharm IDE]] || Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || Py``Charm's integrated debugger works for Python and Jython, supports debugging of multiple threads, remote debugging, allows debugging Django, Google App Engine applications and unit tests. The debugger features various breakpoints, stepping modes, frames view, watches, evaluate expression tool and a debug console. Conditional and Exception breakpoint types are available for more precise control. Debug console allows executing any Python statements in the context of the process being debugged while stopped at a breakpoint.||

|| [[http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/|PyScripter]] || Windows || PyScripter is a free and open-source Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created with the ambition to become competitive in functionality with commercial Windows-based IDEs available for other languages. Being built in a compiled language is rather snappier than some of the other Python IDEs and provides an extensive blend of features that make it a productive Python development environment. ||

=== Special-purpose tools ===

|| [[http://code.google.com/p/pythontracer/|pythontracer]] || || ||
|| [[http://www.aminus.net/wiki/PyConquer|PyConquer]] || Any || Trace hook logger which outputs each thread in its own "swimlane" to make multithreaded analysis easier. Can also time calls (naively) and watch variables. ||
|| [[http://github.com/darwin/firepython|FirePython]] || GoogleAppEngine + Firefox || "FirePython is a sexy python logger console integrated into Firebug (similar to FirePHP)". See [[http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/firepython-logger-console-inside-firebug/]] ||
