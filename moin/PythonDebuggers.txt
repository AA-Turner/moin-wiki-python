=== Unix & Multi-platform Debuggers ===

|| '''Name''' || '''Platform''' || '''Notes''' ||
|| [http://rpdb.digitalpeers.com rpdb] || Unix,Windows,Mac OS X|| ( is Obsolete replaced by rpdb2) rpdb.py improves pdb.py's usability and adds support for remote debugging, multiple threads debugging, post mortem of unhandled exceptions, and for debugging of embedded scripts.||
|| PdbRcIdea || All || A .pdbrc for Pyhon's standard debugger, pdb,  which allows you to run arbitrary Python commands on pdb startup.||
|| [http://sourceforge.net/projects/hapdebugger/ HAP Python Remote Debugger] || Windows || A python IDE with remote debugging capability.||
|| [http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/ Winpdb and Rpdb2] || Unix,Linux,Windows || an advanced python debugger, with support for smart breakpoints, multiple threads, namespace modification, embedded debugging, encrypted communication and speed of up to 20 times that of pdb.||
|| [http://jpydbg.sourceforge.net/ JpyDbg] || Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows || both a CPYTHON and a JPYTHON(JYTHON) debugging framework which has been integrated inside Jedit as a standard jedit pluggin.||
||[http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/pydb pydb] || Unix, Windows, OS X || An expanded version of the pdb loosely based on the gdb command set. The debugger supports thread debugging, signal handling, non-interactive tracing, and much more.||
||[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/ DDD] || Unix || DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, GNU Make debugger, or the Python debugger. DDD displays data structures as graphs and plots. A deprecated version of pydb comes with this package. For GNU make debugging, use [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61395&package_id=65341 ddd-test5]||
||[http://web.archive.org/web/20040331032128/home.t-online.de/home/Ulrich.Herold/pydebug.py pyDebug] || Unix,Windows || Debugger for Python programs with a graphical user interface. It is inherited from "bdb" but uses a GUI and has some powerful features like object browser, windows for variables, classes, functions, exceptions, stack, conditional breakpoints, etc.||
|| [http://pydev.sf.net PyDev] || Mac OS X, Linux, Windows || Allows debugging multiple threads in Jython and Python (It is featured as a 'Python IDE' plugin for Eclipse).||
