== Useful, practical notes and code snippets from the python-dev mailing list ==

After an 8-hour bug hunt, Tim Peters [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-April/034557.html noted this bit of wisdom]

"""
Word to the wise:  don't ever try to reuse a variable whose address is
passed to PyArg_ParseTuple for anything other than holding what
PyArg_ParseTuple does or doesn't store into it.  You'll never get the
decrefs straight (and even if you manage to at first, the next person to
modify your code will break it).
