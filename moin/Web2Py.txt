A framework for WebProgramming.
=== Masthead ===

   URL::  http://www.web2py.com/
   version:: 1.82.1
   licence::  GPL
   platforms:: Unix, Windows, Mac
   Python versions:: >= 2.4 < 3.x

=== Deployment Platforms ===

mod_wsgi is preferred as it has full WSGI support, but also it can run with FCGI, etc. It also comes with a standalone Web server for development purposes.

=== URL dispatching ===

URLs are mapped directly to functions in a controller. No need to use regular expressions (although them can be used). 

=== Environment Access ===

Web2py creates ``request``, ``response`` and ``session`` objects that are globally available. 

=== All-in-One ===

Web2Py comes with:
 * An admin interface to design, edit, test and deploy totally via web
 * A database administration interface to insert, update, delete and run queries.
 * Ticket system to manage errors
 * Authentication: supports groups, users and privileges. 
 * Integrated Ajax and jquery javascript support
 * HTML Helpers, Menues, Validators, URL Mapper, etc.
 * Webservices support (JSON, XML_RPC, AMF_RPC, SOAP)
 * Many third party libraries (rss, rtf, etc.)
 * etc...

=== Persistence Support ===

Web2Py's provides a Data Abstraction Layer (similar to an object-relational mapper), currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3,  MSSQL, Oracle, DB2, Ingress, Informix, Firebird and GAE with some caveats.  Web2py generates customizable CRUD interfaces directly from the tables. The automatic creation and migration of database tables is supported. The DAL can handle almost the 100% of the queries elegantly in a pythonic way resembling SQL (no need to know advanced POO or learn a new complex query language).

=== Presentation Support ===

Web2Py's has a python capable template language. It looks like this:

{{{
{{if condition!=something:}}
{{=title}}
{{pass}}
}}}

=== Documentation ===

A [[http://www.web2py.com/book|book]] is available both printed/pdf and freely accessible via web, written by the lead developer, who is a University Professor.
