Described as an "Experimental Native Python GUI Library", PyGUI is a project by Greg Ewing of [[http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/|Pyrex]] fame. It is a recently reactivated attempt to develop a cross-platform pythonic GUI API. The goals of the project as stated on the home-page are:

 * Develop a GUI API that is designed specifically for Python, taking advantage of Python's unique language features and working smoothly with Python's data types.
 * Provide implementations of the API for the three major platforms (Unix, Macintosh and Windows) that are small and lightweight, interposing as little code as possible between the Python application and the platform's underlying GUI facilities, and not bloating the Python installations or applications which use them.
 * Document the API purely in Python terms, so that the programmer does not need to read the documentation for another GUI library in terms of another language, and translate into Python.
 * Get the library and its documentation included in the core Python distribution, so that truly cross-platform GUI applications may be written that will run on any Python installation, anywhere.
