Organizers' meetings use the #pycon IRC channel.  To access it from Pidgin:

If you don't yet have an IRC protocol account, open the Buddy List window, select menu "Accounts" -> "Add/Edit", click the "Add" button, then:

:Protocol: IRC
:Screen name: (you; please use your real name)
:Server: irc.freenode.net (the default)
:Password: (None needed)

Once you have an account, return to the Buddy List and choose "Buddies" -> "Join a Chat", then:

:Account: The IRC-protocol account you just created
:Channel: #pycon
:Password: (leave blank)
