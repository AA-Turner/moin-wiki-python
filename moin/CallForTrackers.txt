Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure commitee put out a call for trackers (bug/request/issue/ticket trackers) in June 2006 in order to evaluate alternatives to [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470 SourceForge] for use by the Python development team.  A copy of that request can be found at OriginalCallForTrackers.

Jira was the first choice of the committee.  A lot of people complained 
about using a closed-source and hosted bug tracker, so a call was posted for volunteers to help administer a Roundup installation.  Enough volunteers came forward, so work is now proceeding on improving the conversion to Roundup.

The Roundup bug tracker is 
at http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/.

A meta-tracker -- a bug tracker for the Roundup bug tracker -- 
is at http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/.  Please report problems with the bug tracker there.
