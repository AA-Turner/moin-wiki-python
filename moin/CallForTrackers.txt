= About =

Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure commitee put out a call for trackers (bug/request/issue/ticket trackers) in June 2006 in order to evaluate alternatives to [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470 SourceForge] for use by the Python development team.  A copy of that request can be found at OriginalCallForTrackers.

/!\ No new trackers are being accepted for consideration. /!\
