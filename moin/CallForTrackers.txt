= About =

Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure commitee put out a call for trackers (bug/request/issue/ticket trackers) in June 2006 in order to evaluate alternatives to [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470 SourceForge] for use by the Python development team.  A copy of that request can be found at OriginalCallForTrackers.

/!\ No new trackers are being accepted for consideration. /!\

Four trackers were set up by the deadline of August 7 2006; see below for the list.  A committee of four people is now looking at the submitted trackers, and will recommend one for use as the new Python bug tracker.  The committee will make its recommendation in the fall, perhaps in October.  

Once a tracker has been selected, a new installation will be set up and the SourceForge bug data will be converted once more.  That conversion may be more carefully done than the conversion for the demo trackers.
