== Accomplishments ==

 * Andrew Kuchling added many, many examples to the library reference.

 * Kevin Cole started a detailed review of the Python Tutorial.

 * FredDrake removed the {{{xmlcore}}} package, leaving only the {{{xml}}} package found in previous releases.  Tests were added that check for some of the problems that provoked the removal.  This resolves (at least) SF:1511497 and SF:1513611, and obsoletes SF:1504456.

 * Fixed SF:1193966 (weakref documentation cleanup for extension types).

 * Various minor documentation cleanups.

 * Tom Hoffman and Alan Elkner refactored Tom's tinyzis project, removing redundant code and adding functional tests.  ZIS (Zone Integration Server) is part of the Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) with will eventually be used to allow SchoolTool to talk to moodle.

 * Add more here...

The Career Center has a parking lot of its own; parking is free.

Only one of the automatic doors is operating on weekends; take the rightmost door.

The sprint is in the cafeteria; bear to the right on entering the building.

Thanks to Jeff Elkner and Dave Welsh for arranging the sprint space.

== Projects ==

Please add what you'd like to work on to this section.

Python 2.5 beta 3 will be released several days after the sprint.

Look over the list of NeedForSpeed successes and failures and continue from some of those ideas.

Add Doc/howto/ directory to the build process for the documentation.

Possible bugs/patches: SF:1496501 SF:1495229 (doc bug)
SF:1494314 SF:1491431 SF:1488934 (possibly-tricky I/O bug)
