== Sprint Accomplishments: October 21, 2006 ==

 * JeffreyElkner worked on [http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html/index.html How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python], adding TkInter exercises.

== Sprint Accomplishments: September 23, 2006 ==

 * AndrewKuchling worked on using a new templating system, [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/ rest2web], for the python.org website.  The result is still preliminary, but promising.

 * FredDrake spent most of his time trying to figure out how to better deal with the documentation sections on www.python.org; there's more to be done, but the section for Python 2.5 now matches the style of the rest of the site.

 * Fred and Andrew spent some time reviewing the issue trackers being considered to replace the trackers on SourceForge.

 * FredDrake started going over the review comments Kevin Cole provided on the [http://docs.python.org/doc/doc.html Python Tutorial], most of which were produced at the previous Arlington sprint.

 * JeffreyElkner worked on [http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html/index.html How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python], fixing errors found by readers and adding exercises.

 * David Muffley and George Paci worked on [http://dc.ubuntu-us.org/projects/gasp/ Gasp], adding unit tests and fixing bugs.


== Sprint Accomplishments: July 28-30, 2006 ==

 * AndrewKuchling added many, many examples to the library reference.

 * Kevin Cole started a detailed review of the Python Tutorial.

 * FredDrake removed the {{{xmlcore}}} package, leaving only the {{{xml}}} package found in previous releases.  Tests were added that check for some of the problems that provoked the removal.  This resolves (at least) SF:1511497 and SF:1513611, and obsoletes SF:1504456.

 * Fixed SF:1193966 (weakref documentation cleanup for extension types).

 * Various minor documentation cleanups.

 * Tom Hoffman and Alan Elkner refactored Tom's tinyzis project, removing redundant code and adding functional tests.  ZIS (Zone Integration Server) is part of the Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) with will eventually be used to allow SchoolTool to talk to moodle.

 * Interns William, Will, Robbie, and Linda worked on the skilldriver package which allows the creations of assignments that utilise competencies.

 * JeffreyElkner completed updating the 1st 9 chapters of the second edition of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python (http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/python/english2e/html).

 * PaulCarduner and Eldar Omuraliev enhanced the journal package so each student can have a separate journal for each of their sections.  A new CanDo skin was also made for overriding schooltool's actions menu layout.  Work began on a more intuitive competencies editor with flexible tree layout.

 * Competency Gradebook was enhanced with javascript cell navigation
