=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, MVC design. Includes a template system, object-relational mapper and a framework for dynamically creating admin interfaces.

Django has been actively developed over the past year and a half. Ruby on Rails is similar to it, but Django is written in Python and has a few more advanced conveniences for super-quick Web development.

=== Comments ===

This framework is a potential competitor for Rails.  It can claim one high profile site so far, chicagocrime.org though the same was true of Rails when the hype started.  If Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison blog about it and evangelize it in the same way that DHH did for Rails and the meme manages to propagate across the blogosphere, Django may achieve a similar profile.  A big win for Rails was the accompanying documentation, the very active wiki and the screencasts.  This made it much more approachable for  interested web developers to get started.
