=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed and used over the past two years by a newspaper Web operation, Django is well-suited for developing content-management systems. It was designed from scratch to handle the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of experienced Web developers. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY principle.

Includes a template system, object-relational mapper and a framework for dynamically creating admin interfaces.

Ruby on Rails is similar to it, but Django is written in Python and has a few more advanced conveniences for super-quick Web development.

This framework is a potential competitor for Rails.  It can claim one high profile site so far, chicagocrime.org though the same was true of Rails when the hype started.  If [http://www.holovaty.com/ Adrian Holovaty] and [http://simon.incutio.com/ Simon Willison] blog about it and evangelize it in the same way that DHH did for Rails and the meme manages to propagate across the blogosphere, Django may achieve a similar profile.  A big win for Rails was the accompanying documentation, the very active wiki and the screencasts.  This made it much more approachable for  interested web developers to get started.

It appears from [http://www.postneo.com/2005/07/17/django-python-on-rails#comment-6331 this blog comment] that the Django crew intend to pursue the approach outlined in the previous comment.  Meanwhile, [http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000484.html DHH has recently written about how he has grown an open source ecosystem around Rails].
