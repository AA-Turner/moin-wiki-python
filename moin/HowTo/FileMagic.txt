'''Today''' == Saturday, October 25, 2008

With special thanks for many of '''The Keys''' to '''frank''' and [[http://boodebr.org/main/python/build-windows-extensions|his blog]].  Also, an [[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cppeak3.html?ca=dgr-lnxw03PythonEggWithSetuptools|IBM article on setuptools]] had the info that helped me (at least) "install" setuptools without easy_install.  (Necessary '''Today''' for Py v2.6; see below.)

I ''tried'' with Python v2.6, but could not get it to work; I'm still not familiar with the magic of eggs, distutils, setuptools, etc.  If anyone has the fix(es), let me know and I'll retest, revise, and update this info!  (FYI: The problem is it's acting as if it can't find magic1.dll; if v2.6 is uninstalled, v2.5[.2] is [re-]installed, all works A-OK.)

This is my NON-PRISTINE copy of SWIG-able python-magic, unless/until Mr. Hupp re-posts it to his site (see below): [[attachment:LARZ-python-magic-v0.1-c112ac064b7f.zip]]

'''NOTE:''' Mr. Hupp is working on a newer version; thus, all of this may become depreciated...

This is what I did.  It works on (32-bit) Windows XP Pro, SP3, on an old Athlon system with <=512MB.

As they say: Your Mileage May Vary...  :)

= Software Used/Needed =


== CygWin ==
version 2.573.2.3

http://www.cygwin.com/

May setup with all default settings, except '''''MUST ADD'''''
  '''Devel''' (group)
     * gcc (3.4.4-3)
     * gcc-core (3.4.4-3) (should auto-select)
     * gcc-g++ (3.4.4-3) (should auto-select)
     * gcc-mingw (20040810-1)
     * gcc-mingw-core (20050522-1) (should auto-select)
     * gcc-mingw-g++ (20080522-1) (should auto-select)
     * make (3.81-2)
     * SWIG (1.3.36-1)


== GnuWin32 - (Magic) "File" Utility ==
version 4.26 (more recent than what was available via CygWin '''Today''')

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/file-4.26-setup.exe

May setup with defaults, except (''I recommend'') change install directory from
 * GnuWin32\File
to simply
 * File

'''NOTE:''' It's already set to install below "Program Files"


== Python ==
version 2.5.2

http://python.org/ftp/python/2.5.2/python-2.5.2.msi

Installed with all default settings EXCEPT install-to path
 * C:\Program Files\Python25


== (Python) setuptools ==
version 0.6c9

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

As of '''Today''' there wasn't a pre-built .EXE installer for Python 2.6 (which I'd TRIED to test with first, to no avail), SO had to "hack" a bit - see IBM article link, above, for some info... simply grab
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
and run
  python ez_setup.py

Otherwise, if an installer is avail for your ver of Py, use it!  :)


== python-magic ==
version '0.1' (c112ac064b7f) with/for SWIG

http://hupp.org/adam/hg/python-magic

'''NOTE:''' Adam (Hupp) doesn't have the SWIG version posted any longer; my copy isn't "pristine"; anybody have one lying around to send me?  :)


= Configuration & Changes =

== C:\Program Files\Python25\Lib\distutils ==

=== distutils.cfg ===
must have thiw file, with at least

{{{[build]
compiler = mingw32}}}

=== version.py ===
Due to newer CygWin, change line 100 from
  {{{version_re = re.compile(r'^(\d+) \. (\d+) (\. (\d+))? ([ab](\d+))?$',
}}}
to
  {{{version_re = re.compile(r'^(\d+) \. (\d+) (\. (\d+))? (\. (\d+))?$',
}}}


= Do The Installation Shuffle =

Go to where you've put the python-magic source files, then:

{{{path=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Python25;C:\cygwin\bin;C:\Program Files\File\bin

python setup.py install}}}


= Examples of Output You Might See =

=== No setuptools ===
{{{Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 1, in <module>
	from setuptools import setup, Extension
ImportError: No module named setuptools}}}
