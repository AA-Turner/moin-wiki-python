= Cloud PyPI -- Example CDN =

In order to test drive a PyPI CDN, we've setup an example CDN on Amazon Cloudfront for pypi.python.org.

 * https://d1t66zoqn9vlte.cloudfront.net/simple/

== Settings ==

These are the settings:

 * Origin: pypi.python.org
 * Default Root Object: pypi
 * Origin Protocol Policy: HTTP OnlyMatch Viewer
 * Viewer Protocol Policy: HTTPS Only
 * Minimum TTL: 3600
 * No forwarding of cookies or query strings

As a result, the CDN is only available over HTTPS (there's no redirect in place) and the content is fetched from PyPI using HTTPS as well.

The TTL is set to a low value for testing purposes. For a deployment, the value can be set to a much higher value for the package pages; and a lower value for the /simple/ index itself.

''Note:'' Without cache headers in the PyPI response (it currently doesn't send cache headers), the default TTL for the cache retention is 24h, according to the Amazon documentation.
