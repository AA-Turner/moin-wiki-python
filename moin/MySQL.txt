= MySQL =

  URL:: http://www.mysql.com/
  license:: GPLv2
  platforms:: Unix, win32, win64, MacOS X, i5/OS

== Pros ==

 * Easy to install and administer
 * Support for many SQL Features (v5.0 and up):
  * Good compliance with SQL standards
  * Foreign Keys (using InnoDB)
  * Stored Routines
  * Views
  * Triggers
 * Subqueries (as of v4.1)
 * Partitioning (as of v5.1)
 * ACID compliant (InnoDB and NDB storage engines)
 * Character set support
 * Built-in Replication
 * Many administration tools from third parties
 * Widely deployed
 * Regarded as being fast
 * Modular storage engines and interesting clustering features

== Cons ==

 * Early versions (v4.1 and earlier) have the reputation for only basic SQL support (entry-level SQL 92) and deviations from the standards. Many interesting features (views, triggers,..) are included in the latest version (5 and above), but are missing in prior versions. Check [[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html|SQL Modes]] for making MySQL more strict.
 * Some [[http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html|gotchas]] for MySQL v4.1 and earlier.
