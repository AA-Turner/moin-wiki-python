== Supported Python Applications ==
 * ["Zope"]
 * A MySQL driver exists for ["PyDO"] (Python Data Objects)

== Pros ==
 * Many administration tools from third parties
 * Fast

== Cons ==
 * Only '''very''' basic SQL support (entry level SQL 92). Many interesting features (subqueries, views, triggers, ...) are included in the latest version (5 and above), but are missing in prior versions.
 * Some [http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html gotchas] (documented but unexpected features)
