== Pros ==

 * Many administration tools from third parties
 * Widely deployed
 * Regarded as being fast
 * Modular storage engines and interesting clustering features

== Cons ==

 * Reputation for only basic SQL support (entry-level SQL 92) and deviations from the standards. Many interesting features (subqueries, views, triggers, ...) are included in the latest version (5 and above), but are missing in prior versions.
 * Some [http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html gotchas] (documented but unexpected features).
