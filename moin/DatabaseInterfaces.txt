= DBMS interfaces =
Things you connect to. [[BR]]
Take a look at 
http://www.python.org/topics/database/modules.html and
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Python/Modules/Databases_and_Persistence/.

== MySQL ==
 * mysqldb module http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-python.html
 * SnakeDb (http://www.scriptfoundry.com/modules/snakedb/)

== PostgreSQL ==
pypgsql (http://pypgsql.sf.net/)

== Oracle ==
 * dcOracle
 * cxOracle

== Sybase ==
module developed by Dave Cole http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/sybase/

= Native Python Databases =

== gadfly ==
Gadfly is a simple relational database system implemented in Python based on the SQL Structured Query Language. 
Currently use C-extension module for speed. Pure Python version included.

== ZODB ==
Zope Object DB

== shelve ==
A [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-shelve.html ''shelf''] is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with ''dbm'' databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects -- anything that the [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pickle.html pickle] module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.


= Datafiles interfaces =
Things you open.

== xBase ==
Which stands for .dbf files interface.[[BR]]
.bdf files were produced by several old systems like dBase(II,III,IV), Fox(Base,Pro)

== dbm ==
A family of old unix plain hash tables. Has varieties like dbm, ndbm, gdbm, dbmdb185.[[BR]]
See [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-anydbm.html anydbm],

in Python Standard Library.

== MetaKit ==

== SQLite ==
Actualy it's a full-fleged SQL server, but embeddable. No external SQL server required. Think of Gadfly, only faster.

= Special file interface =

 * http://python-dsv.sourceforge.net/ CSV or any separated file (see also PEP:305)
 * ConfigParser.py - Windows .ini format
 * gzip.py
 * zipfile.py
 * tar
 * pdf http://www.pythonware.com/
