= Generic Database Interfaces and APIs =

 * The Python standard for database interfaces is the [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/|Python DB-API (PEP 249)]]

 Most Python database interfaces adhere to this standard.

 * Most databases have ODBC support; see the section below on ODBC modules.
 * Java databases usually support JDBC, and can be used from Jython.
 * See also DbApiModuleComparison
