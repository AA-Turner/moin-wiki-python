  ''This page seems to duplicate ChoosingDatabase, wouldn't it be better to merge shelve and the rest there? -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2003-02-11T23:15:22)]]''

  ''I don't think so. Now they surely have to be refactored both, but ChoosingDatabase seems to be a good page for one place for categorized comparision to narrow novice's choice while that is merely a catalog. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime(2003-02-11T16:50:45)]]''

  ''I seems missed DbApiModuleComparison page. Probably I better combine them with links from both places. -- MikeRovner [[DateTime()]]''

= DBMS interfaces =
Things you connect to.

Take a look at 
http://www.python.org/topics/database/modules.html and
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Python/Modules/Databases_and_Persistence/.

== MySQL ==
 * mysqldb module http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-python.html
 * SnakeDb (http://www.scriptfoundry.com/modules/snakedb/)

== PostgreSQL ==
 * psycopg (http://www.zope.org/Members/fog/psycopg) (!) preferable
  *important notes for psycopg
   *for commands that require running outside of a transaction use autocommit
    *ie conn.autocommit()
   *never commit on a cursor, always commit on a connection
 * pyPgSQL (http://pypgsql.sf.net/)
 * ["sipPQ"]
 * PyGreSQL (http://www.pygresql.org) and PoPy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/popy) are [http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-announce/2003-07/msg00002.php merging]
 * PostgresPy (http://python.projects.postgresql.org/)

== Oracle ==

See ["Oracle"] for details, there are two choices:
 * dcOracle
 * cx_Oracle

== Sybase ==
module developed by Dave Cole http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/sybase/

== MSSQL ==

== BerkeleyDb ==

== ThinkSQL ==
 * Pure Python DB-API 2.0 module http://www.thinksql.co.uk

== Informix ==
 * DB-API 2.0 module available here: http://informixdb.sourceforge.net/

= Native Python Databases =

== gadfly ==
Gadfly is a simple relational database system implemented in Python based on the SQL Structured Query Language. 
Currently use C-extension module for speed. Pure Python version included.
http://gadfly.sourceforge.net/

== ZODB ==
http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB Zope Object DB

== shelve ==
A [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-shelve.html ''shelf''] is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with ''dbm'' databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects -- anything that the [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pickle.html pickle] module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.

== KirbyBase ==

= Datafiles interfaces =
Things you open.

== xBase ==
Which stands for .dbf files interface.[[BR]]
.dbf files were produced by several old systems like dBase(II,III,IV), Fox(Base,Pro)
 * xBase (http://linux.techass.com/projects/xdb/) - Python interface in plans
 * http://www.fiby.at/dbfpy/index.html - working now. or (take it [http://starship.python.net/crew/jjkunce/python/dbfpy.tgz here])

== dbm ==
A family of old unix plain hash tables. Has varieties like dbm, ndbm, gdbm, dbmdb185.[[BR]]
See [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-anydbm.html anydbm], 
[http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-dumbdbm.html dumbdbm],

[http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-dbm.html dbm],
[http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-gdbm.html gdbm]
in Python Standard Library.

== MetaKit ==
http://www.equi4.com/metakit/python.html

== SQLite ==
Actualy it's a full-fleged SQL server, but embeddable. No external SQL server required. Think of Gadfly, only faster.
http://pysqlite.org/

= XML Databases or Interfaces =

== Forest ==

[http://cvs.infrae.com/forest/ Forest] is a (native) XML database written in Python. It is intended to 
support fast queries of XML data.


== 4ODS ==

http://www.4suite.org/


= Object-Relational Mappers =

[http://sqlobject.org SQLObject] is an object-relational mapper. It allows you to translate
RDBMS table rows into Python objects, and manipulate those objects to
transparently manipulate the database.

[http://www.tux4web.de/orm ORM] The Object Relational Membrane is a Python package that provides the functionality of an object relational layer like EJB or other persistence storage systems. It is a thin compatibility layer between SQL table layouts and Object Oriented Python. While providing a good deal of functionality, it tries to be as small and simple as possible. It works with PostgreSQL and MySQL.

[http://www.qlime.org/ QLime] Easy to use, transparent data access to relational databases or other data sources. See examples here: http://www.qlime.org/example.rst
