= Python Conferences =

The Python community tends to organise regional lower-cost events 
around the world.  Established events such as PyCon and EuroPython have since been joined by other regional conferences, and Python often features prominently in various open source conferences.

Want to organize an event in your community?  Read [[AdvocacyWritingTasks/RunningAConference|our guide to running a conference]].

{{{#!wiki tip
A list of conferences is also found on the [[http://www.pycon.org/|general PyCon site]].

See the [[PythonEvents]] page for schedule information.

If you are planing a Python conference event, please also check [[http://www.python-academy.com/events/python_events.html|this event list]] for a suitable non-overlapping date.
