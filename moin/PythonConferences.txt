= Python Conferences =

In contrast to the early years of Python and the original InternationalPythonConference series, the different sections of the Python community now tend to locally organise lower-cost events in several different locations around the world. Established events such as PyCon and EuroPython have since been joined by other regional conferences, and Python often features prominently in various open source conferences.

 * PyCon (North America)
 * EuroPython (Europe)
 * Python UK (United Kingdom)
