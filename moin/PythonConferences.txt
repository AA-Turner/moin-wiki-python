The Python conference world is changing. There seems to be a general feeling that, while there is still room for a full-blown InternationalPythonConference, the collective PythonCommunities should also broaden the audience by organizing lower-cost events.

The second annual [http://www.pycon.org/dc2004 PyCon community conference], ["PyConDC2004"], is being held 24-26 March 2004 at George Washington University's Cafritz Conference Center in Washington, DC.
This is a low-cost community-organized conference.  There will be four days of sprinting on various projects before the con, from March 20 to March 23; see SprintPlan2004.  So, if you've always wanted to see ExtremeProgramming in action, the PyCon sprint will be a good place to start.

The first such event was [http://www.pycon.org/pastevents/dc2003 PyCon DC 2003], held at George Washington University's Cafritz Conference Center in Washington DC, from 26-28 March 2003. The major theme of the conference was '''''Popularizing Python''''' and it was a great success!
A two-day "sprint" event was held before the conference with several teams working on different projects including the Python core, Twisted, Zope 3, and others.


IPC 11, the eleventh InternationalPythonConference, was a track at OSCON 2003, organized by O'Reilly.
