The Python conference world is changing. There seems to be a general feeling that, while there is still room for a full-blown InternationalPythonConference, the collective PythonCommunities should also broaden the audience by organizing lower-cost events.

The first such event is [http://www.python.org/pycon/ PyCon DC 2003], with a planned (but currently unannounced) conference fee of less than $200. It will be held at George Washington University's Cafritz Conference Center in Washington DC, from 26-28 March 2003. The major theme of the conference is '''''Popularizing Python''''', -- we all want to see our favorite langauge achieve world domination, and this will be the perfect venue to plan the coup. :-)

A two- or three-day "sprint" event is planned before the conference with the intention of improving various aspects of the Python core. There may also be a further sprint immediately following the conference, and there are rumours that at least one commercial concern will be taking advantage of the presence of so many Pythonistas in the area to organize their own sprint. So, if you've always wanted to see ExtremeProgramming in action, PyCon will be a good place to start.

IPC 11, the eleventh InternationalPythonConference, will be a track at OSCON 2003, organized by O'Reilly.
