You can have HTML documentation for your projects hosted for free by PyPI.  It will be displayed at a URI like this:

    http://pythonhosted.org/<project_name>

Note: this ''used'' to be

    http://packages.python.org/<project_name>

and those URLs will be redirected to the new hostname.

= What PyPI accepts =

The documentation must comply with this rules:

 * Only static files are supported.
 * There must be a top-level file named "index.html".
 * All the files should be packed into a zip file.

= How to upload =

If your project uses setuptools, you can send your documentation to PyPI directly from your terminal:

    python setup.py upload_docs

By default, the directory "build/docs" will be zipped up and sent.  Pass --upload-dir on the command line or in the setup.cfg file to adapt it.

Distutils2 also provides this command:

    pysetup run upload_docs

The upload-dir option has the same default value.


= How to manually upload =

If you can’t or don’t want to use a command, you can zip the directory, log into PyPI using a Web browser, select the project from the “Your Packages list” and use the form at the bottom of the edit page to upload the zip file.
