## page was renamed from PyPiHostingDocumentation
You can now host documentation at

    http://packages.python.org/package_name


To upload documentation:

 * Prepare a .zip file that is unpacked into this URL.
 * Only static pages are supported.
 * The zip file must have a top-level "index.html".

Then log into PyPI, select the package you wish to upload the docs for from the "Your Packages" list and use the form at the bottom of the package editing page to upload the ZIP file.
