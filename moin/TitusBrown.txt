I'm a professor at Michigan State University, where I study biology and bioinformatics.  I'm also interested in testing and
test tools; I'm the author of [[http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/README.html|figleaf]] and [[http://twill.idyll.org/|twill]], among other packages.

For the 2009 Google Summer of Code, I've written up a few ideas on my blog; check 'em out here, http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-09/gsoc-projects.html.  I'm not proposing to mentor all of them ;), but I will
find mentors for interested students.

Contact me at titus at idyll.org.
