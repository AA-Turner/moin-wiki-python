== 5:30PM: Schevo Q&A ==

Come learn about Pat O'Brien's latest creation, Schevo.  Pat is the author 
of PyCrust, PyDispatcher and Pypersyst.  But the real reason he started 
using Python was to find a better way to create database applications using
the power of objects.  Schevo is the result of those efforts.  Come see for
yourself why database applications will never be the same.  :-)
