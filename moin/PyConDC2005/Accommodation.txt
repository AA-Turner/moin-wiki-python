== Accommodation near PyCon DC 2005 ==


A hotel in Arlington located near a metro station would be a good choice, because Foggy Bottom station 
is a brief (15-minute) ride away. Somewhere to the west would work best. The orange line of the Metro system runs from Vienna, VA through Falls Church and Arlington to the GWU stop. Anywhere else will involve a transfer and extra travel time.

See [http://www.arlingtonlodging.net/  the Arlington Hotel Guide] for a list.  For example, the Quality Inn at Court House is about two blocks from the metro.

Possible locations:

 Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)
   
 State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)
  
 Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)
 
 Windsor Park Hotel
  Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations
  
 Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)

 Rouge Hotel (Embassy Row, steps away from the downtown business district and Dupont Circle)

Some places which are close to GWU/Foggy Bottom (ie, walking distance or less than 15 minutes by metro): Georgetown; Dupont Circle; Rosslyn, VA.

Here are some places which are farther away, but still on the metro:  Arlington, VA; Alexandria, VA; Falls Church, VA.  The WMATA has a list of metro-accessible hotels at
http://www.stationmasters.com/Lodging/lodging.html .  Caution: some stations would be 
very far away and require a long commute.
