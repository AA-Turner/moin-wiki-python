Georgetown, an upscale neighbourhood to the west 
of the Foggy Bottom area, has many fine restaurants as long as you're willing 
to walk there; parking is scarce and buses aren't  particularly frequent.

Several Metro stops are connected to huge food courts. Union Station is probably the largest. Washington's small Chinatown district surrounds the Gallery Place/Chinatown Metro stop.  

The Metro station closest to PyCon is Foggy Bottom; walk up to Eye Street and turn left, 
walking a few blocks west.

If you're trying to use a store locator, the Cafritz Center's Zip code is 20052.
