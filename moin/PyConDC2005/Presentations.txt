Greg Lindstrom / NovaSys Health ([http://www.novasyshealth.com])

In business, customer service is the name of the game.  In the
Information Technology field, this service manifests itself in the
ability to accept, format, store, and analyze data.  At NovaSys Health,
we selected Python for our programming needs because it's easy to use,
plays well with a variety of platforms (not only different operating
systems, but a wide variety of databases) and the Python community is as
helpful as it gets.  This talk will discuss how Python is
allowing us to list technology as a competitive advantage (accessing MS SQL database, teaching other techies, 
using Python's standard library).

Python in the Tactical Language Project'''

Prasan Samtani ([http://www.isi.edu/~samtani]), Hannes Vilhjalmsson ([http://www.isi.edu/~hannes])

University of Southern California - Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI)

Project homepage URL: http://www.tacticallanguage.com

The Tactical Language Training system is designed to help learners
acquire communicative competence in spoken Arabic and other languages.
Learners practice vocabulary items and learn gestures, following which
they apply them in a simulated Mission Environment. In the simulation
environment, users interact with the system√≠s onscreen characters using
a speech recognition interface. The simulation environment is built on
the Unreal tournament Game Engine.

In the past several months, a major transition has been made from the
original system in Java, to a new Python-centric architecture. This
presentation traces the evolution of the Tactical Language Training
System from a set of separate programs to a single integrated system.
The various different system components will be introduced, and the
underlying technology behind will be briefly discussed. We will go over
what features of the language we found especially useful for integration
(latent-typing, lambda functions, pickle), and some hurdles we found
particularly tricky coming from a C++/Java background.

The talk will also address the way we tackled the problem of talking to
incompatible languages. For example, Unreal Tournament uses a
proprietary scripting language - UnrealScript - and in order to
communicate with Unreal we had to make use of an earlier ISI technology
called GAMEBOTS, which is implemented both in Python and UnrealScript,
and uses sockets as a method of communication.

Other topics discussed in the context of Tactical Language will adress
the performance issue (writing expensive routines - the speech
recognition and NLP algorithms - in C and authoring extension modules),
the importance of using a powerful language for build scripts, using
algorithmic optimizations over language micro-optimizations and the
importance of Python's standard library in speeding up the development
process.

Extensibility and Customization'''

Ed Leafe / The Dabo Project

It is rare for anyone to create any non-trivial software
project that will not need customization at some point. It is therefore
wise to plan for this when designing your code by inserting hook methods
that are designed to be customized to add additional functionality later
on. By default these methods do nothing, so they can be freely
overridden by others without the risk of losing a critical behavior
because a superclass method had been overridden. This is especially
useful for creators of frameworks and tools that can be extended by
their users. As one of the two primary authors of the Dabo framework, I
am especially aware that in order to be useful, the code I create needs
to be adapted and augmented by developers who build their apps with
Dabo. I will show several code examples from Dabo to illustrate my
points.

[[Anchor(9)]] #9. '''Dabo, the 3-tier
Database Application Framework)'''

Ed Leafe / The Dabo Project

There are several tools available that help a developer create
applications for working with data: Visual FoxPro, Visual Basic, Delphi,
etc. They make some of the tedious parts of the app, such as ensuring
that a change to a value in a text box gets propagated back to the
correct column in the correct record of the correct table in the correct
database on the correct host. These tools all have their strengths and
weaknesses, but none are Open Source, and none are in Python!

In March 2004, two long-time Visual FoxPro developers, Ed Leafe and Paul
McNett, had both become convinced that Python and cross-platform apps
represented the future. Trouble was that there wasn't a tool available
that could do what we wanted; so as a result, we decided to create our
own.

Dabo is designed to create true 3-tier apps, in which the UI, the
business rules, and the data storage are cleanly separated, using a
Chain of Responsibility pattern for the messaging between tiers. We've
chosen wxPython as our initial UI toolkit, but have written our UI
classes so that their interfaces are not wxPython-specific. We currently
support MySQL and Firebird on the backend, with PostgreSQL support
nearly complete.

Grig Gheorghiu / Avamar

I present various test frameworks that are either written
in Python or use Python/Jython as their scripting language. I discuss
these frameworks in the context of agile testing. Here is a high-level view of the talk I'll give:

1. What is agile testing?
 * "agile" as in "agile methodologies", (aka Extreme Programming)

2. Why Python?
 * eminently "agile" language

3. MAIN SECTION: Python-based test frameworks
 * unit testing (unittest, doctest, py.test)
 * continuous performance testing (pyUnitPerf)
 * functional/system/integration testing (homegrown framework) 
 * test distribution, execution and reporting (STAF/STAX) 
 * acceptance testing (pyFIT/FitNesse) 
 * Web application testing (Selenium, MaxQ) 

4. Jython and Dynamic Java
 * Recent discussions on Java and scripting languages
 * Jython is leading the pack in terms of scripting the JVM
 * Java-based test frameworks can be used within Python frameworks via Jython
 * Examples of Java- and Jython-based frameworks (The Grinder, TestMaker, Marathon)
 * Using Java-based tools with Jython (example: HTTPUnit)

[[Anchor(11)]] #11. '''Localized Type-Inference in Python'''

Brett Cannon / Cal Poly SLO

This talk will present research into type inferencing in Python.  The
main goal of this work is to extract a performance gain from
type-specific opcodes added to Python's VM.  The type information needed
to use these new opcodes during code generation comes about from a
simple, localized type inferencing algorithm.  The design of this
algorithm required that no changed be made to the semantics of Python. 
Because of this requirement the type inference algorithm is hindered by
Python's dynamic nature.  This talk will discuss what in Python's
semantics makes type inferencing difficult, the algorithm used, the
added opcodes, and the results of adding the new opcodes.

other Open Standards'''

Andrew Fine / Honeywell

When I started out, I did not have any experience at SGML, XML, or other
markup languages.  It was only when I was perilously close to
reinventing the concept of markup languages, by adapting direct
PythonCOM to Word interfaces from Mark Hammond's book, that I decided
there had be a better way to do this from a design and maintenance
standpoint.

A Web search provided me with a crash education on markup languages such
as XML, HTML, and SGML, on how DocBook SGML was an overwhelmingly
popular open standard, and on how an open source package named OpenJade
could translate a DocBook SGML file into Word Rich Text file.

The arrangement wasn't perfect but I realized two things:  1) it could
save me a year in development and maintenance, and 2) I could respond
rapidly to new assignments.

The purpose of this paper is to show how I integrated
Python, DocBook, and Word together to obtain the perfection my local
organization demanded.

Jacob Kaplan-Moss

The concept of "scripting" is central to the Unix philosophy, but it's always
had spotty support in GUI operating systems.  Early in the Mac OS's history,
Apple recognized this deficiency and developed a framework for scripting GUI
applications.  Although this framework is quite well designed, its native
language is not; AppleScript has been called the only "read-only" language in
existence.  With newly developed hooks into Apple's scripting framework, Python
now gives a far superior environment for scripting.  This talk will focus on
using the latest and greatest Python-AppleScript bridge, appscript_, to script
OSX.

Previous knowledge of AppleScript is not necessary; although this talk will
briefly cover reasons why AppleScript coders should switch to Python, the bulk
of the talk will be spent explaining how to use appscript_ through a series of
(increasingly complex) examples.

science'''

John Hunter and Perry Greenfield / University of Chicago and STScI

matplotlib is a 2D graphics package written in Python.  The design of
matplotlib allows a wide variety of uses: you can create plots
interactively from the shell, generate plots from scripts in a web
application server, create animated or dynamic plots for instrument
control, or embed them in the Python GUI of your choice.  Unlike other
plotting solutions for Python, which are wrappers of libraries from
other languages, matplotlib is written primarily in Python, with calls
to extension code for special purposes.  Thus it is much easier for
Python users to become developers, and matplotlib has an active
community of developers who contribute to the code base. Originally
designed to allow a user coming from Matlab to generate plots with a
similar syntax and quality as Matlab, matplotlib now embraces the best
ideas from Python, IDL, gnuplot and Matlab in the pylab interface, which
is a procedural wrapper around the core object oriented API.

matplotlib is an array plotting package, and is codeveloped with the
developers of numarray at STScI and has full compatibility with the
Numeric and numarray array packages at the Python and extension code
levels.  The abstract class hierarchy is separated from the backend
rendering layer, allowing the same pylab scripts to generate identical
plots in GTK, WX, Tkinter and FLTK, including event handling such as
mouse motion and clicks, as well as generate image output in postscript,
SVG, PNG and other formats.  It is fully integrated with the interactive
Python shell ipython, which runs the GUI mainloops of GTK and WX in a
separate thread, allowing interactive control of plots typical in
packages such as Matlab and Mathematica.

There is support for most of the standard things people want to do with
2D plotting, with a special emphasis on scientific plots, including
images, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, errorbars,
polar and log scaling, contouring, financial charts, legends,
mathematical text with a built-in TeX math expression parser, freetype2,
W3C compliant cross-platform font-management, and more.  matplotlib is
highly configurable, with the default appearance of every plot element
controlled by a configuration file, and all of the plot elements readily
customizable.

Ecosystem with Python'''

Michael Urban / Lion Research Center ([http://www.lionresearch.org])


The Lion Research Center, headquartered at the University of Minnesota,
is responsible for the Serengeti Lion Project in Tanzania, Africa, and
is known throughout the world as a leading institution in the research
of African lions. In this presentation, I will discuss FELIS, which is
software we developed entirely in Python for identifying, tracking, and
analyzing data on African lions in the Serengeti National Park,
Ngorongoro Crater, and other lion projects in Tanzania. The software
uses a pyGTK interface, and uses data from multiple sources. The
software stores its native data using pysqlite. However, the software is
also capable of cross-referencing its own data with additional data
stored in Access databases, and Excel spreadsheets by using the mxODBC
module. In addition, the software includes image processing capabilities
for storing and viewing photographs of lions using the Python Imaging
Library. Thanks to Python, we are now able to identify lions must faster
and with much greater accuracy than was possible before; extract
information based on multiple data sources in seconds that used to take
days to extract manually; and easily share data between field
researchers in Tanzania and our researchers at our headquarters at the
University of Minnesota. Python has really revolutionized the way we
study African lions.

[[Anchor(20)]] #20. '''Fast Networking with Python'''

Itamar Shtull-Trauring 

This talk would cover three topics, each leading
into the next. While the examples are mostly Twisted specific in the
first two parts, the general concepts are relevant to Python networking
specifically and Python programming in general.

1. Algorithms are very important when attempting to
write fast code, including networking. The talk will cover buffering and
string manipulation, and possibly scheduling, and common mistakes that
can make code orders of magnitude slower. Examples will include
Twisted's buffering algorithm rewrite between 1.3 and 2.0, use of
buffer(), imaplib, and maybe comparision of scheduling algorithms
between Twisted 1.3, 2.0 and glib (where Python code is faster than C
code due to a superior alogrithm).

2.  This part of the talk will explain Python's
limitations - reads from sockets/files always allocate memory, lack of
good byte array datatype, general slowness - and show how C or C++ can
be used to circumvent these issues. As an example I will cover Fusion,
an open source C++ integration layer for Twisted, and show how it solves
some of the issues Python has. I will also cover the problems caused by
using C or C++ code.

3. In the final part of the talk, I would like to
cover possible improvements to Python (specifically socket and file
objects) that together with the need for a new builtin type, a byte
array, would allow gaining some of the speed benefits available when
using C/C++.

Python Visual Sandbox'''

Michael Weigend / Holzkamp-Gesamtschule Witten, Germany

When you write a Python program, search for semantic errors, proof the
correctness of a function or just talk about programming, you use
intuitive models of information processing.  An intuitive model is a
mental concept which is simple and self evident and needs no further
explanation.  Usually these concepts can be visualized.  Intuitive
models can be useful or they can be misleading. Sometimes they are
unconscious. The Python Visual Sandbox (PVS) is a collection of
interactive multimedia applications √± usually games, especially designed
for programming novices.  They contain more than a hundred animations
which represent intuitive models including typical misconceptions. The
purpose of the PVS is two fold. First of all it is a research tool to
find out, what intuitive concepts Python programmers use in different
contexts. Secondly it is a learning device which can be integrated in
lesson plans. This contribution focuses on the learning/teaching aspect.

point, bounded precision), the major differences with binary floating
point, and other advantages.

Later I'll show how to use the module, from the simplest way (just use

how to use the Context, including rounding methods, signals, etc.).

Finally, I'll present some cases to show when use and not use Decimal
instead of binary floating point.

Software for Python'''

Warren J. Hack / Space Telescope Science Institute

Multidrizzle began as a collection of FORTRAN code and
IRAF scripts for the combination of Hubble Space Telescope imaging data.
 Through the use of Python and cutting edge modules such as NUMARRAY,
PYFITS, and PyRAF, we have developed a robust piece of software, in less
than one year, that will become the primary tool in the Advanced Camera
for Surveys (ACS) data reduction pipeline for image combination and
cosmic-ray cleaning. This same software has also been made available for
use by researchers to reduce their ACS data on their own systems.  We
will describe the motivations for moving the existing Multidrizzle code
to Python, highlight the challenges that NUMARRAY, PYFITS, and PyRAF
allowed us to overcome, and illustrate how it serves as a primary task
in a developing astronomical data analysis suite for Python.

parcels'''

Ted Leung, Katie Capps Parlante / Open Source Applications Foundation

Chandler aspires to be an innovative open source personal information
manager (PIM).  In addition to being written in Python, Chandler is
using the following open source libraries:  BerkeleyDB, M2Crypto,
Twisted, pyLucene, and wxPython/wxWidgets.  Chandler is designed to be
an extensible PIM.  Chandler's unit of extensiblity is called a parcel,
and Chandler's "built-in" functionality is itself composed of parcels. 
Internally, Chandler is designed as layers of frameworks which provide
applications functionality to parcels.  Parcels communicate with each
other via the data in the Chandler repository.

The goal of our presentation and paper is to allow someone to begin
developing a parcel that extends the Chandler user interface.

[[Anchor(29)]] #29. '''A Layered Event System to Provide Method
Extensibility'''

Jim Fulton / Zope Corporation

Developers often want to extend the behavior of existing software. For
example, a developer might have a class that manages data or provides
some functionality and want to provide a user interface for it. 
Similarly, a developer may want to incorporate an object into a
framework and may need to provide additional interfaces to integrate it.
We've found that adaptation works well in situations like these.

Sometimes, there is a need to extend what happens *inside* individual
methods.  For example, when an object is added to a system, we might
record meta data or index the object's data or meta data.  The actions
we want to take are likely to be application dependent.  It shouldn't be
the responsibility of the code that adds the object to take these extra
actions.  Rather, to address situations like this, we use events and
subscribers. Events signal that something has happened and subscribers
can be registered to perform extra computation when something happens,
thus extending the methods generating the events.

This event system is related to and addresses some of the same needs as
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).  Events are equivalent to AOP
point-cuts and subscribers correspond to advice.  Unlike AOP, events are
explicitly introduced into application code.  An AOP system might be
built on top of this event system by providing tools that automatically
inject events into applications.

An event system provides a very elegant way to implement hooks.  Any
system that uses hooks can be simplified and made more flexible with
events.

Zope has a layered event system, built on an extremely simple
policy-free base.  Additional layers, built on this base layer,
progressively add additional policy.  Zope provides an adapter-based
subscription framework that provides a simple rule-based system.

The basic event system would make an extremely trivial, but very useful
addition to the Python standard library.

In this presentation, I'll discuss the motivation for, and applications
of, events.  I'll give a number of event application examples including
the use of event subscribers to add layers of policy to the underlying
event system.

[[Anchor(33)]] #33. '''Design Patterns and Python OOP: Objects by
Design'''

Alex Martelli

Python is multi-paradigm; however, Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) is Python's core paradigm, and an understanding of
Design Patterns (DP) and of how to best use them is a key enabling skill
in doing effective OO development.  This presentation takes its contents
mostly from the OO chapter of the Python Cookbook (2nd Edition), and
focuses on Design Patterns and related idioms presented there, with
expanded explanations of underlying language mechanisms and additional
examples.

Some classic DPs are practically "built-in" to Python.  Other patterns
can be just as useful in Python as in other languages, if you know them
well and apply them deliberately to structure your design; moreover,
there are language-specific issues and opportunities, connected to such
patterns, which it's important to understand fully.  Other patterns yet
are generally inappropriate for use in Python applications, and may be
best replaced by Python-specific idioms.

Exactly because Python is multi-paradigm, it empowers you to make
meaningful design choices; and, as usual, with power comes
responsibility -- you need solid, in-depth understanding of what choices
you have available, and of what implications and consequences such
choices have, to choose for the best.

When should you use a closure, rather than a class with callable
instances?  Where is inheritance appropriate, and where is it better to
use containment and delegation instead?  When should you define
'__slots__', what exactly are the implications of doing so, and what
alternatives approaches may often be preferable?  The purpose of this
presentation is also to explore this kind of questions, and to provide
the fundamental knowledge and the outlook that will help you answer the
questions in the most useful ways for your own applications.

Python'''

Nathan R. Yergler / Creative Commons


In 2004 Creative Commons began to expand their offerings to include
client applications.  The applications were intended to promote and
complement the licenses offered by Creative Commons.  After evaluating
other languages, Python was chosen as the primary development language,
and wxPython was chosen as the user interface toolkit.  ccPublisher is
the outgrowth of these early decisions.

Today the Creative Commons is preparing to ship ccPublisher 1.0 on Mac
OS X, Windows, and Linux.  Python and wxPython, along with a fair amount
of code manipulation, have enabled us to create a single code base for
all three platforms.  This code base, along with a set of build tools
which are also being released as Open Source software, allow developers
to focus on writing quality applications which integrate well and look
"right" on all platforms.  The overriding goal has been to isolate
platform-specific code and settings, in an effort to share as much code
as possible.

This presentation will focus on the non-intuitive aspects of
cross-platform development with Python and wxPython.  We all know that
Python is available for a wide variety of platforms, but what goes into
creating an application that doesn't require end-users to be aware of
dependencies or languages?  In particular, this presentation will cover
handling platform-specific GUI idioms (Mac OS X menu bars, drag and drop
on all platforms, etc), creating distributions of your application (MSI
for Windows, DMG for OS X, RPM/DEB for Linux) which bundle all the
necessary dependencies and which install seamlessly, and inconsistencies
and problem areas we have encountered during the development of our
applications.  The presentation will also present some "best practices"
developed during the project which have proven useful in minimizing the
effort required to add features and refactor a cross platform
application.

This presentation will be of interest to any Python developer
considering developing end user applications with Python.  It would also
be useful for developers looking for easier ways to manage their
building and distribution process.

[[Anchor(35)]] #35. '''Integrating RDF in Python Applications'''

Nathan R. Yergler / Creative Commons

The Resource Description Framework, RDF, is an exciting and largely
mis-understood area of Internet development.  RDF allows developers to
represent complex relationships in a way which other applications can
understand, often without prior knowledge of schema or datatypes.  Today
RDF engines exist in many mainstream applications such as Mozilla,
largely untapped by developers.

Python has excellent RDF support libraries available, and therefore
should be an excellent platform for developing intelligent applications.
 This presentation will focus of three primary points: clearing up
misconceptions about RDF, providing an overview of the Python libraries
which support RDF, and demonstrating a real world usage of RDF in a
Python application.  The discussion of Python RDF support will also
highlight shortcomings and potential pitfalls associated with RDF
development.  Brief attention will be given to current RDF developments
if time remains.

This presentation will be useful for any developer working on
integrating two or more applications, and to any developer interested in
leveraging future web developments.  Developers will leave the
presentation with a firm understanding of what RDF is and how they may
use it in their applications.

About the presenter:  Nathan Yergler is a Software Engineer with
Creative Commons.  The primary developer of mozCC, ccPublisher and
ccLookup, he has been manipulating RDF for the past 18 months in an
effort to provide human-level integration between applications and the
ethereal Semantic Web.  During that time he has become intimately
familiar with Python's RDF offerings, and widely frustrated by his own
misconceptions.  He wishes he knew then what he knows now about RDF.

[[Anchor(36)]] #36. '''Descriptors, Decorators, Metaclasses:
Python's "Black Magic"?'''

Alex Martelli 

Python's versions since 2.2 have introduced, enhanced, and
clarified some new advanced mechanisms: two of them are the
underpinnings of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Descriptors
and Metaclasses; one, introduced in 2.4, is a syntax for the systematic
application of an important use case for higher-order functions.  This
presentation takes its contents mostly from the (informally known as...)
"Black Magic" chapter of the Python Cookbook (2nd Edition), also known
(official chapter title!) as "Descriptors, Decorators and Metaclasses",
and focuses on some of the most interesting applications and related
idioms presented there, with expanded explanations of the underlying
language mechanisms and additional examples.

_Descriptors_ control and guide attribute access.  Python offers several
built-in descriptor types -- for example, in today's Python, _functions_
are descriptors -- and also lets you code your own.

_Decorators_ are a simple syntax to feed a function as the argument to
another (higher-order) function, and have the latter's resulting value
used in lieu of the original function -- while decorator syntax
('@deco') is new in Python 2.4, you can use the same approach with
slightly clumsier syntax ('func = deco(func)') in 2.3 and even 2.2.

_Metaclasses_ are to classes as classes are to instances.  Python's
built-in metaclass is the built-in 'type', and you can subclass and
customize it to produce custom metaclasses to control behavior of whole
family of classes.

This presentation shows how to best use each of these mechanisms, both
in terms of existing, Python-supplied objects and types (descriptors,
decorators and metaclasses), and of coding and using your own custom
ones.  What are "data" and "non-data" descriptors, and how and why might
you code and use either kind?  When do you need introspection to ensure
proprer decoration, and how can Python's standard library help there?
How should custom metaclasses cooperate to insure peaceful coexistence
of several of them, and how can you solve metatype-conflicts?  And, of
course -- how do custom descriptors, decorators, and metaclasses
cooperate with each other, and with other powerful Python mechanisms
such as introspection, closures and advanced dynamic gyrations, to let
you write elegant and powerfully customized code with minimal effort?
This presentation explores this kind of questions, providing the
fundamental knowledge and the outlook that will help you answer the
questions in the most useful ways for your own applications.

[[Anchor(37)]] #37. '''Iterators and Generators: it ain't your
gramps' loop any more!'''

Alex Martelli 

Python's versions since 2.2 have introduced, enhanced, and
clarified the *iterator protocol*, which describes how items are
produced one after the other, in sequence, typically for use in a 'for'
statement, and supporting mechanisms -- generators, the itertools module
of the standard library, and now, in 2.4, _generator expressions_, which
can be seen as a merge between list comprehensions and generators.  This
presentation takes its contents mostly from the "Iterators and
Geerators" chapter of the Python Cookbook (2nd Edition), and focuses on
some of the most interesting applications and related idioms presented
there, with expanded explanations of the underlying language mechanisms
and additional examples.

An _iterator_ is any object supplying a 'next' method, callable without
arguments, that satisfies certain conditions.  A _generator function_ is
a function which uses the 'yield' keyword to return a _generator
iterator_ object, whose 'next' method is based on suspending and
resuming the function's execution.  The itertools module supplies
several powerful 'building blocks' to deal with iterables (including
iterators and generators) and to produce them -- itertools lets you
program at a very high abstraction level while _increasing_ your code's
performance (an 'abstraction BONUS', rather than the abstraction
*penalty* which is more common in other languages).  Generator
expressions are like list comprehensions which produce their results one
item at a time, via an iterator, without taking up the memory needed to
store all results at once.

This presentation shows how to best use each of these mechanisms to make
your control structures reusable and simplify your application level
code -- by abstracting recursion and other rich and complicated
iteration mechanisms into generators and the like.  How can you repeat
something 17 times, _faster_ than by 'for i in xrange(17):'?  How do you
tame unbounded (infinite) sequences to your purposes?  How can you "peek
ahead" into an iterator without disturbing its iteration-state?  This
presentation explores this kind of questions, providing the fundamental
knowledge and the outlook that will help you answer the questions in the
most useful ways for your own applications.

Development : Why and How we used Python to Produce a New Deal in
Payroll Software.'''

John Pinner / Clockwork Software Systems

Applications like accounts and payroll are the lifeblood of real world
businesses. These applications are usually proprietary and subject to
the usual proprietary software licencing mechanisms.

PayThyme is a brand new UK statutory payroll application, the first
genuinely new payroll software for some time, and the first Open Source
UK payroll.

Commercially PayThyme breaks new ground in almost every respect : it is
the first UK native GNU/Linux payroll, and it has no built-in licence
quota on numbers of users, numbers of employees and numbers of payrolls,
all of which are restricted in most commercial payrolls. Furthermore,
there is just one version of PayThyme, suitable for both the smallest
and largest of payrolls, as opposed to existing software which is
usually targetted in both capability and price at specific market
levels. This allows your payroll to grow with your business. To further
confuse conventional business software developers, PayThyme is licensed
under the GPL and is available as a free download.

Technically, PayThyme is also unusual. It uses the Thyme development
platform, which is itself Open Source and based on Python and the PyQt
GUI platform. A novel set of data-aware widgets links GUI screens
(originated in Qt Designer) with Thyme's database filing system,
allowing rapid object-oriented application development. The product was
developed by a small core team of three people working remotely using a
central Subversion repository. The user interface is implemented
entirely in Python.

PayThyme takes advantage of Python's rich set of extension modules, for
example in implementing Internet Filing of end-of-year returns to the
Inland Revenue via the UK Government Gateway.

[[Anchor(44)]] #44. '''Object-oriented design with Python'''

Bruce Eckel / www.MindView.net

This session presents general object-oriented design principles, but
focuses on object design issues where Python is distinct from mainstream
statically-typed languages.

For example: What kinds of Lightweight design tools make sense in
Python, and which does Python obviate? What would it mean to have
interfaces in Python, and what sort of features would be valuable? Since
Python produces smaller code, can objects be bigger? Tradeoffs in static
vs. dynamic type checking on design and implementation. What you can do
in the constructor vs statically-typed languages.

Not rules, but guidelines and ideas presented for discussion: Interface
inheritance vs. implementation inheritance, substitution vs extension,
the impact of Python on these concepts. Partitioning your design into
objects. Not enough objects and objects that are too big/complex.
Creating robust objects. Wiring together objects to create an
application. Design by contract; Base classes as interfaces with
constraints. Preferring composition to inheritance.

Design patterns issues: Which design patterns in GoF are so C++-ish that
they don't make sense in Python? Does the Visitor design pattern have
any relevance in Python? Built-in design patterns: Generators (special
case of factories). Python and the homogeneity problem (Composite
pattern, using isinstance).

An OpenSpace discussion will follow as soon after the session as
availability permits.

[[Anchor(45)]] #45. '''py.test and the py lib'''

holger krekel / merlinux GmbH

Authors: Holger Krekel, Armin Rigo 

We present a novel testing tool which allows to write unit tests with
hardly any boilerplate.  Unlike the many JUnit clones, py.test lets you
use the plain assert statement. If failing, you get a convenient
anaylsis of intermediate values in the assert's expression.  Example:
{{{
def f(): 
   return 23

def test_something(): 
   assert 42 == f()
}}}   

is the full content of a file that you can run with py.test: no imports,
no inheriting classes or other magic incantations needed.  Just write a
global function that starts with 'test_' and run py.test on that file. 
You will see in the py.test generated traceback that "42 == 23" failed.
Reusing the 'assert' statement is actually closer to the mother of
JUnit/testing: SUnit from the Smalltalk world.

For the failing assert expression we use a hack to directly re-interpret
its Syntax Tree.  This is a limited AST-Mini-Interpreter, as it can only
interpret expressions and a number of statements but luckily this is
more than enough to give you precise clues for why a test fails at a
certain assertion.

Generally, testing is a perfect match to control and make full use of
Python's flexibility.  But unfortunately, the testing mechanisms of most
python projects are more or less entangled hacks around unittest.py.  We
think that we can and should do better than this.

Basically py.test aims to provide a new integrated and pythonic test
environment which enables _sharing_ of common testing support code, such
as HTML and PDF reporters, GUIs and customization or mock-object
facilities.

But there is more. Apart from the user-exposed test facilities and
features the py lib contains higher level introspection classes, support
for dynamic code generation, a new approach to distribute python code
across networks and processes, and a "Path" abstraction allowing uniform
access to the local file system, subversion file systems or remote Path
objects through e.g. SSH connections. We'll see if there is enough time
to talk about all of the latter (otherwise we intend to do lightning
talk demonstrations).

[[Anchor(46)]] #46. '''The Compete File System:  File System
Virtualization using Python'''

Christopher Gillett / Compete, Inc.

The Compete File System (CFS) is a file management and file system
virtualization software layer and Unix command set. CFS provides a
framework for distributing files across multiple file systems while
allowing the end-user or software developer the convenience of viewing
the multiple systems as though they were a single large file system.
Internally, CFS uses load balancing and server scheduling algorithms to
provide maximum file system space availability while maintaining file
server performance. CFS provides this functionality while still
remaining in user application space - modifications to the operating
system kernel are not necessary, and CFS never needs to operate in
kernel or protected mode. In fact, to the extent that the underlying
physical file systems can map to the local host's file system, CFS is
largely system and platform independent.

CFS is written entirely in Python. The ability to develop high quality
code extremely rapidly using Python combined with the depth and
sophistication of the Python runtime system allowed a very small team to
create this powerful system-level software package very quickly.

Nat Goodspeed / [http://www.solidworks.com SolidWorks Corporation]

In an event-driven system such as a game environment, it's common to
want to start some action, such as an animation, that will run for
several frames. But in an event-driven system, control reaches the same
entry point over and over again. There are various ways to ensure that
the right code is executed for each frame -- but using Python generators
makes it remarkably natural and readable.

This talk presents the Animator class, along with its friends and
relatives !TimeAnimator, Sequencer and !AlarmClock.

[[Anchor(53)]] #53. '''Writing Efficient Rule-Driven Software in
Python'''

Phillip J. Eby / Telecommunity Consultants

In the design of applications, rules are everywhere: business rules,
game rules, routing rules, "expert systems", code and query optimizers,
and rule-based "agents" and triggers. But to implement rules, they have
to be converted into code -- usually in the form of decision trees that
become increasingly difficult to maintain as the number of rules grows.
Recent developments in computer science, however, make it possible to
automatically convert rules into decision trees that are guaranteed to
be correct and efficient, even for large numbers of rules, without using
a specialized logic or rule language like Prolog or Lisp. This
presentation will give an overview of how to implement rule-driven
systems directly in Python, using Python itself as the language for
specifying rules, with faster development and execution times than would
be obtained by hand-coding if-then trees. Examples will be based on the
predicate dispatch implementation included in the latest version of the
PyProtocols package.

Tom Hoffman / SchoolTool

SchoolBell is an open source calendar server for small to medium sized
organizations, written for Zope 3.  Each person, group or resource has a
calendar accessible via an HTML interface.  A user can integrate events
from other people or groups into their calendar.  iCalendar support
allows interoperability with clients like Mozilla Calendar and Apple's
iCal.  Access control can be set for each calendar to allow events to be
viewed or added by specific users or groups.

SchoolBell is also a Zope 3 application that breaks out of the Zope 2's
"folders and documents" paradigm, instead using a directed graph data
model.  Application objects, such as people, groups and resources.  Each
object can have facets which model the object's responsibilities and
encapsulate its data for a particular role that object plays in the
system.  Objects are connected via relationships.  Each relationship's
type is defined, as is each object's role in the relationship.  Each
object, relationship, role and facet is identified by a URI,
facilitating a comprehensive REST-style web services API for all the
application's functions.  This architecture has broad applicability
outside of calendaring.

SchoolBell is based on SchoolTool, a free IT infrastructure for schools,
funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation.  The initial design for
SchoolTool was done by Steve Alexander of Canonical Ltd.  Subsequent
development has been done by Programmers of Vilnius and Etria LLC.

Project manager Tom Hoffman will begin with a tour of SchoolBell,
followed by a discussion of its unique architecture led by Brian Skahan
of Etria.

[[Anchor(56)]] #56. '''Yarn: Working with Messages in Diverse
Formats and Protocols'''

Abe Fettig / JotSpot

People today read, write, and organize information stored in many
different places, using many different formats and protocols. In the
course of a single day, a person might read and send email, get the
latest news through RSS, post to their weblog, create or edit a page on
their Wiki, add a new site to their del.icio.us bookmarks, upload
digital photos to Flickr, monitor items being sold on eBay, and check on
the status of a package being shipped through UPS.

This poses a challenge for application developers. Users want their
programs to be able to access their data, regardless of the system in
which the data lives. But implementing support for all these formats and
protocols is expensive and time consuming.

This talk introduces Yarn, a Python library that allows developers to
work with a wide range of file formats, messaging systems, and web
services, using a standard API.  Yarn currently provides support for
reading and writing RSS, Atom, OPML, mbox, and maildir files, on a local
filesystem or over HTTP or SFTP; the Atom and MetaWeblog blogging APIs;
IMAP, POP3, and SMTP; and web services including Google, Amazon, Flickr,
del.icio.us, and UPS package tracking. Yarn provides APIs for reading,
writing, and editing messages, searching, and navigating folder trees. 
It also includes such helpful features as metadata storage, connection
sharing, caching, and credentials management. An extensible architecture
makes it easy to support new formats and protocols through plug-ins.

Yarn is written in 100% pure Python, using the Twisted framework. It is
currently licensed under the GPL, but will be released under a more
liberal license before PyCon 2005.

This talk will introduce Yarn and show how it can be used to add
powerful messaging and publishing functionality to Twisted applications.
 It will demonstrate how the command-line utilities included in Yarn can
be used to read and copy messages, even between systems that don't speak
the same protocol.  It will also present code examples showing to use
Yarn in various ways.

Oliver Steele / Laszlo Systems, Inc.

OpenLaszlo is an open source platform for developing interactive
client-side web applications.  It consists of a compiler, that compiles
XML with embedded JavaScript to (currently) Flash files; and a runtime
XML and JavaScript library.  Applications built using the Laszlo
platform have been deployed on the Earthlink home page and Yahoo, among
other sites.

The OpenLaszlo compiler and application optimizer were implemented in
Jython.  The use of Jython allowed us to implement a full-featured
deployable JavaScript-to-bytecode compiler in a short amount of time
(three months).

This talk will describe how Jython's introspective, interactive, and
integration features enabled the use of development methodologies that
made this development speed possible, and how having the compiler in
Jython then allowed us to experiment with innovative new features at a

This presentation will provide an overview of the options available in
Python's datetime module, and some of the third-party packages such as
dateutil that have been developed in response. We will explore such
topics as time durations, recurrence rules, and fuzzy parsing, then
tackle the intricacies of time zone support.

The presentation will start with datetime fundamentals, introducing the
different kinds of datetime instances. It will explore some common
problems with dates, then delve into the trickier issue of timezone
support.

The presentation will provide a brief overview of the features available
in two third-party packages: dateutil, which supplies a variety of handy
utilities including finer manipulation of date operations, recurrence
rules, and fuzzy parsing, and a form of timezone support; and pytz,
which provides a convenient Python implementation of the Olson timezone
library. The presentation will finish by exploring some of the issues
involved in working with timezones and demonstrating of how these
package deal with those issues.

The presentation is intended for beginners and intermediate pythonistas.

[[Anchor(61)]] #61. '''Streaming Python'''

Thomas Vander Stichele / Fluendo

Flumotion is a GPL streaming media server written in Python. It is
distributed and component-based:  every step in the streaming process
(production, conversion, consumption) can be run inside a separate
process on separate machines.

Flumotion uses Twisted and GStreamer.  Twisted enables the high-level
functionality, distributing components over the network.  GStreamer,
through the Python bindings, enables the high-speed low-level
functionality: actual media processing.

Flumotion uses a central manager process to control the complete
network; one or more worker processes distributed over machines to run
actual streaming components; and one or more admin clients connecting to
the manager to control it.

Flumotion is a young project under very active development.  In its
current release (0.1.4), it already supports the following features:

- various sources: webcams, soundcards, TV cards, Firewire cameras

- various codecs: Vorbis, Theora, mulaw, JPEG, smoke

- various containers: Multipart, Ogg

- username/password authentication

- overlaying, colorbalance

- HTTP streaming

- disk archiving

- administration GUI with a wizard for the most basic scenario

- code distribution from a central location

- local caching of the distributed code space

- strong focus on ease of use and usability

The current design allows for the following future features:

- multiple GUI's thanks to clean model/view separation in admin clients

- any number of sources/containers/codecs/effects/protocols to be added

- completely centralized code upgrades

- complete code upgrades with minimal downtime

- any kind of authentication mechanism (key exchange,
challenge/response, ...)

- any number of possible scenarios for actual content production and
distribution

- manager failover and state replication

- loadbalancing streams over different servers or from different
locations

- internal stresstests

Some of the features are only possible or easily implementable thanks to
using a high-level language like Python:

- sending GUI code for the wizard and component administration from the
manager to the admin client, making the admin GUI a lightweight shell

- sending component code to any of the workers over the wire at startup

- rebuilding modules and reloading code on the fly while running;
allowing for a distributed code upgrade without losing clients

- rapid development of new components, allowing to catch up with and
eventually to keep one step ahead of the competition

- easy networking code thanks to Twisted

In this project, we came up with solutions to specific problems
presented to us that would be interesting to share with others.

- all code is stored centrally and partitioned into "bundles" which are
cached by clients who need them.  Versioning and dependencies are
correctly handled, and to the code being run this is handled
transparently. Code can still import as if it were one big file tree.

- the manager sends GUI code to an admin client and component code to a
worker.  The GUI code running on the admin machine then controls the
behaviour of code running on the worker machine by going through the
manager machine

- state of components is automatically replicated one level deep to the
manager, and two levels deep to all connected admin clients

- authentication of any service in the network is handled by creating
keycards which can be exchanged between all processes, implementing any
type of challenge/response authentication as securely as possible.

- Twisted's Perspective Broker was extended to use this generic keycard
concept instead of the current (limited) username/password credentials.

- the open-ended nature of Twisted and GStreamer is difficult to harness
into a usable GUI.  The wizard provides a good way of crystallizing all
possibilities into a sensible task-based presentation.  The design of
the wizard also incorporates the flexibility of the network distribution
and the dynamic code distribution by pulling in the necessary GUI code
for the next step based on previous choices.

- moving to run-time checks of functionality as opposed to
compile/configure-time.  Since the server can be distributed over any
number of machines, and actual components have different run-time needs,
all checks for features (devices, required libraries, versions,
permissions)


Python also presents some specific challenges when used in a large
project as compared to more low-level languages.  When handled right,
these can actually be turned into project engineering advantages. 
Python's weak argument typing forces developers to document the API
correctly. Python's dynamic nature (running code from received chunks,
extensive subclassing) and Flumotion's design (componentized
functionality, lots of small pieces of code sent back and forth) forces
us to aggressively write unit testing for all functionality.

Ted Leung 

pyblosxom is a weblogging system written in Python.  It uses
the filesystem storage model pioneered by blosxom, but has diverged in
terms of internal architecture and organization.  pyblosxom takes a
microkernel approach to blogging software by providing a small core
framework that embodies the blogging data flow.  Callbacks are placed at
strategic points so that users may override as much or as little of the
framework's default functionality as they desire. These callbacks can be
used implement plugins whose functionality can range from alternate page
rendering to comments to calendar based archives.

pyblosxom has a growing user base and a small, friendly development

Python's simplicity principle ("there should be one -- and preferably

findings (20 mins), and a discussion of what the next few steps should
be towards solving this problem (10 mins).

[[Anchor(70)]] #70. '''A Python Preprocessing Framework for
Hydrologic Modeling '''

Dr. Vic Kelson / WHPA Inc.

At our hydrological consulting firm, we often encounter modeling
problems in which a variety of different hydrological model codes are to
be used on a single project. We typically use models that are based on
the Analytic Element Method, in which the input data for the models are
vectors and the model domain is a continuum. In particular, we often use
the 2-D groundwater code ModAEM (Kelson, 1998) and TimML (a 3-D analytic
element model written in Python with Fortran extensions). It is
becomming more and more important to make use of ModAEM for regional
simulations, then extract a local 3-D model for use in TimML. In
addition, we make use of inverse modeling (parameter estimation) codes,
such as PEST.

The use scripts that within GIS software, such as ArcGIS or Manifold, is
one option, but those codes run only on Windows, and we need the ability
to run models on other platforms (e.g. a Linux cluster). We also
encounter data in a wide variety of formats, ranging from GIS project
files to ESRI Shapefiles to flat comma-separated variable files or even
SQL databases. What we need is the ability to:

1) Prepare model input files from spatial (and other) data sets

2) Script the operation of our models (especially for use in inverse
modeling)

3) Use data from a wide variety of GIS and other formats

4) Transfer results from one model as input for another

5) Facilitate analysis of model results.

We also prefer to make use of open file formats and we use Linux systems
for large computational scripts.

The author has developed a Python framework that hides the I/O details
for a variety of different data storage formats, for the purpose of
building preprocessing and postprocessing scripts for hydrological
models. Currently, these tools are used with our in-house analytic
element codes, but we expect to implement facilities for use with
finite-difference codes, such as MODFLOW. The talk will describe the
problem and the Python object-oriented framework for model
preprocessing, including the way it has been extended for transferring
data between models.

and Twisted to write Reliable Peer-To-Peer Programs'''

Glyph Lefkowitz / Divmod

The internet is designed to facilitate symmetric connectivity between
peers. With the advent of personal internet access, however, several
features of today's internet, including network address translation,
corporate firewalls, and dynamically assigned IP addresses, those
connections are now far from symmetric, and in many cases not even
possible.

This paper will explore several solutions to this problem which use
Python's inherent flexibility and Twisted's networking infrastructure to
solve it in a general manner. Several code examples will be presented
where, using Twisted's separation of protocol and transport layer,
existing applications are made to work by modifying only one or two
lines of code.

It will cover each of the obstacles to connectivity in order of
difficulty: dynamic IPs, NAT, and finally firewalls. It will also
discuss the security, user interface, and application ramifications of
being able to provide connectable services on each user's PC and/or
other IP connected device.

Covered networking techniques will include:

 * Detecting the ability to open a port on a static, internet-visible IP, by providing a callback server. 
 * Using stateful UDP filters on most modern firewalls to provide a temporary, virtual connection. 
 * Load-balancing so that users with truly broken connections (such as those made through a corporate firewall using the "CONNECT" HTTP command
through a proxy) can piggyback on users with more open connections without causing them an undue amount of load. 

Existing internet standards will be covered as well:
 * SIP * STUN * UPnP

Finally, the paper will propose a standard set of techniques and an
accompanying protocol for gradually and gracefully falling back to
progressively less efficient techniques so that transport-level concerns
don't interfere with an application's functionality until it is actually
impossible to establish any kind of connection.

The presentation will cover a several of the techniques explored in the
paper and will focus on real-world implementation and deployment of
these techniques. It will present code examples, and include several
demonstrations, hopefully using the wireless internet access provided by
the conference, but with a small virtual network if that one is
unavailable for some reason.

included within the Nevow web application framework.

Yarden Katz / MINDSWAP

Rule processing engines have proven to be useful in several areas of
Computer Science and software engineering, ranging from expert systems
in bioinformatics to serving as backends for web content management
platforms.  Pychinko is a forward-chaining rule engine capable of the
generic use rule engines have traditionally received, but geared for
Semantic Web applications.  Pychinko, implemented purely in Python,
employs the well-known and scalable Rete algorithm for expert systems. 
We present the use and architecture of Pychinko (including a brief
exposition of the Rete algorithm), as well as several of its compelling
use cases, including examples from software engineering, web
applications, and Semantic Web specific tasks.

book collection with PyAmazon, ZODB, and wxPython)'''

Michael Bernstein / Panhedron

This presentation is about how I used Python to build a simple solution
for inventorying my extensive book collection for insurance purposes. It
demonstrates Python's strengths in increasing programmer productivity
through simplicity, availability of standard and third-party libraries,
and flexibility.

[[Anchor(78)]] #78. '''PyPy and type inference'''

Armin Rigo 

A technical status report on PyPy, the Python interpreter
implemented in Python.

The PyPy project aims at producing a simple runtime system for the
Python language, expressing the basic abstractions within the Python
language itself.  Simplicity and Flexibilty are the foremost goals.  We
hope to reach around PyCon a C-translated version of PyPy that is able
to work independently of CPython.

To reach our goal, we are currently working on a Python source analysis
and compilation toolchain -- based on PyPy as well -- and a minimal
low-level core that doesn't need CPython any more.  The presentation
will focus on these tools, which are able to perform automatic static
type inference of "static enough" Python programs and then compile them
to various lower-level languages (currently C, Lisp, Pyrex and Java). 
This analysis works on fully standard Python sources (bytecodes,
actually), and the distinguishing feature of the techniques we use --
"abstract interpretation" -- is to allow type inference to be performed
for any language for which we have an interpreter.  Moreover, it doesn't
require explicit type annotations added by the user.

In the presentation, we will see how these tools can be used generally,
i.e. how you could use them to check or improve the performance of your
programs.  In particular, what are the "staticness" restrictions that
must be met for these tools to work?

We will then look under the hood:

* how we build control flow graphs;

* how we perform type inference, and what "type inference" precisely
means in this context;

* type inference is not the end of the story: good code must be
generated from the source and the inferred types.

The techniques relate to Psyco's, the just-in-time specializer for
CPython.  We will compare them, and also contrast the "internal" notion
of type used as an implementation detail (as in PyPy and Psyco) with the
other typical approach of explicit user-specified types.

Our approach is motivated by the desire of flexibility: it allows issues
that normally require early design decisions to be postponed, and
addressed later in possibly more than one way, without rewriting
everything.  Typical example: adding Stackless-style continuations in
CPython required a whole-scale rewrite, but has only a "local" impact on
PyPy.  We will plead for a framework based on interpreters as a way to
gain the most flexibility from programming languages -- and the best
performances too, for very-high-level languages!

Evan Jones / University of Waterloo

One of Python's primary benefits is that it automatically manages
memory, as any high level language worth the name should. Unfortunately,
Python never actually releases any RAM to the operating system.
My presentation will discuss how Python's current memory allocator
works, and describe the problem in detail. I will then present some
workarounds to avoid the problem with the current version of Python.
Next, I will present my proposed changes to the allocator which resolve the
problem. Finally, I will suggest a future direction for Python memory
management.

For additional information on this topic, see my web page about the
problem, or the Python-dev archives:

Jython'''

S.Prasanna / M.E Computer Science, Anna University

The paper discusses in detail about servlet and servlet filters
programming in Jython. When I started Jython programming I struggled to
get some useful and genuine resources on Jython server side programming
especially for servlet filters. This motivated me to write a unique and
a different tutorial in jython. I hacked into Jython and did some work
in this area and now I use Jython instead of pure Java for server side
programming.

This white paper can be regarded as a simple and a genuine Jython server
side programming tutorial and its a small contribution from my side to
the Jython community. This paper also explains how to compile some
latest python modules in jython with a simple example.

In short the objective behind this tutorial is to portray the
capabilities of Jython in server side programming and how to use Jython
with some latest Python modules.

[[Anchor(81)]] #81. '''Envisage - An Extensible Application
Framework'''

Martin Chilvers / Enthought Inc

The Java world has two dominant frameworks for extensible application
development: Netbeans and Eclipse.  Although many people think of these
two projects as IDEs, they are both built upon open architectures that
are designed to support generic GUI application development.  Treading
lightly in the footsteps of these two excellent projects, Envisage
attempts to bring similar capabilities to the Python community.

The heart of Envisage is its plug-in architecture; in fact, the Envisage
core is little more than a system for discovering, loading, starting and
stopping plug-ins.  Developers construct applications by choosing from
the set of supplied plug-ins (possibly the empty set) and then adding
their own to provide domain-specific functionality.  Although an
Envisage application need not have a GUI, Envisage comes with an
ever-expanding set of plug-ins that simplify many of the more common and
tedious aspects of GUI development (e.g., window management,
menubars/toolbars, user preferences). It is worth noting that these
'standard' plug-ins are written in exactly the same way as those written
by an application developer.  Each plug-in uses the Envisage extension
mechanism not only to contribute to what came before it, but also to
define how future plug-ins can contribute to it.  This mechanism is
simple but consistent, and ensures that even extensions to an
application are extensible.

Despite the fact that development is still in its early stages
(especially when compared to the enormous effort that has gone into both
Netbeans and Eclipse), Envisage has already been used to deliver
production applications, with two more scheduled in the first half of
this year.

This presentation will introduce the Envisage plug-in architecture, and
demonstrate how applications both with and without GUIs can be built
with it.

David Morrill / Enthought Inc 

Traits is an open source Python package developed at Enthought, Inc.
that adds an interesting collection of capabilities to the Python
developer's toolkit. In a nutshell, one could say that Traits "adds type
checking" to Python, but that would be a misleading oversimplification.
Perhaps a more useful characterization would be in terms of the five
major features of the package:

- Initialization - Validation - Notification - Delegation -
Visualization

Traits has been used at Enthought over the last two and half years in a
variety of projects written for real-world clients. During that period,
Traits has evolved from an interesting set of features embedded within
the Chaco scientific plotting package to a separate package which, along
with Envisage, is now the cornerstone for all of Enthought's Python
development efforts.

As part of that evolution, Traits has recently been rewritten from the
ground up to take advantage of our experience developing applications
using the orginal Traits package, and to address a number of performance
and software engineering issues that had arisen. The result is a new,
streamlined, faster version of Traits which is capable of solving a much
broader range of programming problems in a very straightforward, simple,
efficient, and, dare we say it, elegant, fashion.

The purpose of this talk will be to introduce the audience to the Traits
package, provide examples and demonstrations of Traits in action, and to
describe some of the better design patterns, such as MVC (Model, View,
Controller), that Traits supports, and in fact, encourages.
