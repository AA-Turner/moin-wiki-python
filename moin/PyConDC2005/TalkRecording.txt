= About the Audio and/or Video Recording of Presentations =

----
== Legality and Obtaining Permission ==

The conference organizers are, in general, in favor of recording the sessions but we
need each presenter to either sign a release or verbally agree on tape at the start
of his session.  Personally I think a paper release is better as it spells out the
usage, and that such a paper should be included in the paperwork given to the presenters
at the registration desk.

However, someone needs to coordinate with whomever has the list of presenters and
check off names as forms are received, and nag those who haven't returned one yet.
And indeed someone needs to be formal holder of those pieces of paper.

Technically speaking, I hope and believe that we can record *all* of the sessions
and only remove those for whom we lack permission during the post-processing phase.
It just makes life easier than trying to turn on/off recording equipment at the right
time.

== Approaches Taken ==

Some want to record just the audio and some want to record video as well.  Some want
to record by hooking into the room audio system "the board" and some detached.  Now
there's nothing wrong with some redundancy but obviously we can't have multiple
people hooking into the audio system and trying to coordinate with the GWU staff.

=== My Approach (Jeff Rush) ===

I know nothing about the issues of video recording and am just planning on recording
audio.  I also am unsure of the capabilities of the room audio system, and besides
I thought it a good idea to try to capture audio from the audience when the questions
start flying.  Perhaps foolish and noisy.

I also didn't want to babysit a pointable microphone or start/stop recording for each
presentation.  I'd rather be off enjoying the conference.  So my approach is to drop
a "black box recorder" in the presentation rooms, leave them running all day and pick
them up each night for storage and perhaps offloading if sufficient space/bandwidth
can be found.  I would place each box off to one side of the podium, with a stereo
pair of omnidirectional mics clipped to the wall/curtain in some manner.  From such
a position I hope to capture both the speaker and audience.
