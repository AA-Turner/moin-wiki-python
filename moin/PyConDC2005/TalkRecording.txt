== Legality and Obtaining Permission

The conference organizers are, in general, in favor of recording the sessions but we
need each presenter to either sign a release or verbally agree on tape at the start
of his session.  Personally I think a paper release is better as it spells out the
usage, and that such a paper should be included in the paperwork given to the presenters
at the registration desk.

However, someone needs to coordinate with whomever has the list of presenters and
check off names as forms are received, and nag those who haven't returned one yet.
And indeed someone needs to be formal holder of those pieces of paper.

Technically speaking, I hope and believe that we can record *all* of the sessions
and only remove those for whom we lack permission during the post-processing phase.
It just makes life easier than trying to turn on/off recording equipment at the right
time.
