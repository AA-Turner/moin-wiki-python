This page collects suggestions for speakers and presenters at PyCon.

= Presentation advice =

 * Rehearse your talk before giving it.  Practice it several times.

 * If in doubt, err on the side of not talking long enough.  It's better to have the audience thinking "That talk left me wanting more.  I need to go talk to the presenter/download the package/go to the BoF," than "That talk stretched 15 minutes of material into an hour.  What a waste of time."  

 * Don't waste time on introductory material, e.g. explaining Python's syntax, explaining XML for fifteen slides.

= The final version of your proposal =

 * PyCon no longer has a published volume of proceedings; talks are now only available on-line.  Therefore, write the final version for online viewing.  While PDF is allowed, submitting the presentation in HTML is better.  Keep graphics reasonably sized for web access.

 * Finish preparing the online version of the paper before PyCon.  This gives the audience more information in choosing which talks to attend, and people can refer to the paper during your talk for more details.
