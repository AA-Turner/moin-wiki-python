Please add planned sprints to this page.  Feel free to create new wiki pages for planning your sprint in detail.

= Introduction =

== What is a sprint? ==

A sprint is a focused development session, in which developers pair in a room and focus on building a particular subsystem. A sprint is organized with a coach leading the session. The coach sets the agenda, tracks activities, and keeps the development moving. The developers work in pairs using XP's pair programming approach.

The sprint approach works best when the first few hours are spent getting oriented -- presenting a tutorial for the development material, laying out the stories to tackle for the day, getting everyone a CVS  or SVN checkout to work with.

[http://www.zopemag.com/Guides/miniGuide_ZopeSprinting.html ZopeMag's miniGuide to Zope Sprinting] 
is a good introductory article; just
mentally remove every "Zope" from the article to make it generic.


== Why sprint at PyCon? ==

The sprints are intended to benefit various projects, and to encourage more people to take part in development. They will also be a good place to see ExtremeProgramming or other AgileMethods in action, and to work closely with experienced Python developers.

PyCon will always have a core Python sprint. Other topics will come and go
each year.

If you wish to participate in a sprint, please contact the sprint organizers in advance!
Sprint topics are listed below.

(Can we get a link to a common reference page describing how Sprints work, for those whom this is their first sprint?  Does each person bring a laptop?  Do we use a private LAN in the sprint room or have Internet access to a Subversion server?  How is chaos avoided?)

= Possible Sprint Topics =

== Python Core ==

* rewrite setup.py

* rewrite site.py
  I'd like to see something like {{{site.addsitedir()}}} made into a public API so that additional directories of ''.pth'' files can be processed in a consistent manner without having to re-implement that machinery.  -- FredDrake

* handle bugs / patches


= Logistics =

 Location: GWU (rooms TBD).

 Time: TBD.

 Date: Saturday March 19 through Tuesday March 22 inclusive.

 Cost to attend: Free!

 Bring: Your laptop and a wireless card.
