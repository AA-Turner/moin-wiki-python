This page explains the duties of reviewers on the program committee.  Committee members can add questions and observations to this page.  '''Do not refer to specific proposals on this page''', because this page is publicly visible.

Reviewers have logins on http://submit.pycon.org, just like proposal authors.
Reviewers have the additional privilege of being able to view other proposals and to 
record comments and votes on them.

Proposals will be assessed using the [http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~oscar/Champion/champion.html Identify the Champion] process.
Basically, reviewers vote using a +/- 1, +/- 0 scale.  To be accepted, a paper must have
at least one +1 vote; the person who votes +1 on a paper is the paper's champion.

When reviewers log in, their web page will list their own proposals as well as 
a bunch of hyperlinks to various specialized lists of proposals.  The most important
list is the one of           
proposals still needing reviews.  Reviewers can then view those proposals             
and record your vote on it along with additional comments.  

Reviewers should join [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-pc/ the pycon-pc mailing list],
which is for program committee discussions. 
                                                                                
When a proposal is submitted, three reviewers are randomly assigned to          
it.  Those                 
assignments aren't enforced, so reviewers should feel free to skip proposals assigned            
to them that they don't feel competent to review.  Conversely, reviewers can always review proposals          
assigned to other people, and doing so is greatly encouraged.
