This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.  Perhaps we'll 
manage to implement some of them at PyCon?

Aahz: 
    * I've been thinking (without much energy to do it) that the
    Community link on the main page ought to point at a new page instead
    of the incredibly stale PSA link. ''Well, PyCon will be a focal point
    for whatever replaced it, I'm guessing - SH''

    * While doing that re-org, perhaps the SIGs link ought to be moved
    and the Beginner's link replace it, with a prominent link on the
    Newbies page to "What is Python?"

    * HOW-TOs currently at http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/ should be
    moved to http://www.python.org/ (somewhere)

    * http://www.python.org/doc/Summary.html needs an update

    * http://www.python.org/psa/Users.html should be moved to a Wiki

    * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with
    a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many
    people we're targeting.)

    * http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html and
    http://www.python.org/UserGroups.html need to be re-organized,
    probably using a database so we can create multiple views.

AMK: 
 * Suggested top links, in this order: "Home", "About", "Download", "Documentation", "Help", "Search".  That's 7 links, not 8; any suggestions for one more? ''A random choice made once an hour from a given set? Advertising? Python tips?''

 * The top page is too long.  Ideas to shorten it? ''One suggestion might be to put the text of the Google quote next to the graphic. For example, [http://www.holdenweb.com/Python/python.org.htm] gets more directly to the point.''

 * doc/Intros.html: why two "What is Python?" links? ''For the especially clueless? :-)''

 * Too many introductions!  doc/Intros.html, doc/Introduction.html, doc/Newbies.html, doc/Hints.html.  Trim down this material and have one location for it.


From PythonEditors:
 * Python.org's [http://python.org/editors editors page.] ''This wiki page replaces and obsoletes that page, it should redirect here.''
