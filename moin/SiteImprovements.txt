This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.

== intro ==

'''improving''' means enhancing site user's experience to find information faster and easier using the way they've used to. Major things that need improvement are usually obvious for everybody, but they seem Epic (Single Sign On, OpenID, online docs editor). Minor features are on the surface for each of us in particular, but they are not obvious for everyone else (wiki page subscription on edit, boring design).

'''improving''' is a process. Key to make any process effective is to provide a '''feedback''' that should be easy to reach and visible to others (see PHP online manual comments).

A lot of information causes frustration. That's why ''twitter'' takes over ''blogger''. Too much '''inventory''' in the room makes it hard to navigate and hard to notice needed things. '''cleanup''' should throw unused stuff from standing in the way. It's especially true for wiki, but various python.org pages are accounted as well. Big amount of information reduces ''fun factor''. Separate '''status''' page will help people see what's going on and have more fun by focusing their work and working together.

== misc ==

 * Fix webmaster@python.org response bug (per [[http://bugs.python.org/issue7929|issue7929]])
 * Add website repository to http://svn.python.org/view/

== www ==

 * add release timer and calendar to [[http://www.python.org/dev/|Core Development]] page
 * '''report bug''' or '''suggest a change''' link leading to corresponding bug tracker (PythonWebsiteCreatingNewTickets wiki link) (issue #8146)
 * http://www.python.org/download/windows/ should indicate latest supported Python for old versions of Microsoft systems ([http://bugs.python.org/issue8146|issue #8146])
 * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many people we're targeting.)

== wiki ==
 * Add autolinking to python tracker, e.g. issue #1024, issue 1024, issue1024, bug 1024 and bug #123
   * (./) Added to InterWikiMap as `Issue`. For example: Issue:7942 in the tracker. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:32:26+0100)>>

 * Clean up Community/Python Writers page, above all: remove dead links 

 * Upgrade the Python theme to the one used by [[http://wiki.europython.eu/|the EuroPython Wiki site]].

 * Shorten URLs - remove /moin/ prefix from http://wiki.python.org/moin/SiteImprovements#Wiki

 * Add "automatically subscribe to pages I edit" plugin from http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinPatch/AutomaticSubscriptionOnEditPreference to increase people awareness about changes going on on the wiki.

 * '''Fix bug''' can't rename the page (A page with the name 'xxx' already exists. Try a different name.)

 * '''Fix bug''' with PythonAroundTheWorld not appearing in CategoryAroundTheWorld (may have something to do with http://moinmo.in/HelpOnCategories).

 * '''Fix bug''' [[Admin/Wiki]] doesn't appear in CategoryPythonWebsite list

 * Update wiki SystemInfo to latest version
 
 * Remove annoying "captcha" for sane users who logged in

 * Update ''oldschool'' page icons to a more hardcore/pop version. (Fixed in an upgraded theme.)

 * Remove rarely used links in Wiki menu in the left.

 * Add improved event calendar support such as that provided by [[http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/EventAggregator|EventAggregator]] or another similar extension.

 * Enable the OpenID support.

 * Rationalise the natural language coverage (merging the "new" language pages with the old ones).

 * Switch to [[http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting|TracWiki syntax]]
   * Why? Trac's syntax, apart from the stuff that's identical to !MoinMoin's syntax, is like the old !MoinMoin syntax, and although it's better than !MediaWiki syntax in various ways (take the [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links|link syntax]] and its inconsistencies), switching to it would be like reverting a number of fixes that !MoinMoin applied when its syntax (particularly the [[MoinMoin:LinkPattern|link syntax]]) was changed in 1.6. I don't deny that bits of it can be complicated, but that's not usually the basic stuff. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:32:26+0100)>>
