This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.

== intro ==

'''improving''' means enhancing site user's experience to find information faster and easier using the way they've used to. Major things that need improvement are usually obvious for everybody, but they seem Epic (Single Sign On, OpenID, online docs editor). Minor features are on the surface for each of us in particular, but they are not obvious for everyone else (wiki page subscription on edit, boring design).

'''improving''' is a process. Key to make any process effective is to provide a '''feedback''' that should be easy to reach and visible to others (see PHP online manual comments).

A lot of information causes frustration. That's why ''twitter'' takes over ''blogger''. Too much '''inventory''' in the room makes it hard to navigate and hard to notice needed things. '''cleanup''' should throw unused stuff from standing in the way. It's especially true for wiki, but various python.org pages are accounted as well. Big amount of information reduces ''fun factor''. Separate '''status''' page will help people see what's going on and have more fun by focusing their work and working together.

== www ==

 * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many people we're targeting.)

== wiki ==

 * Upgrade the Python theme to the one used by [[http://wiki.europython.eu/|the EuroPython Wiki site]].

 * Add "automatically subscribe to pages I edit" plugin from http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinPatch/AutomaticSubscriptionOnEditPreference to increase people awareness about changes going on on the wiki.

 * Fix bug with PythonAroundTheWorld not appearing in CategoryAroundTheWorld (may have something to do with http://moinmo.in/HelpOnCategories).

 * Update wiki SystemInfo to latest version.

 * Update ''oldschool'' page icons to a more hardcore/pop version. (Fixed in an upgraded theme.)

 * Remove rarely used links in Wiki menu in the left.

 * Add improved event calendar support such as that provided by [[http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/EventAggregator|EventAggregator]] or another similar extension.

 * Enable the OpenID support.

 * Rationalise the natural language coverage (merging the "new" language pages with the old ones).
