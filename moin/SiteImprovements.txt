== Introduction ==

The process of improving the Web site should entail enhancing the user experience so that users may find the information they are looking for faster and easier than the way they are used to. Although major things that need improvement can be obvious to many people, some of these things can seem like tasks of epic proportions, too big for an individual to consider tackling on their own: single sign-on to all the different resources, the introduction of OpenID support, an online reference documentation editor - these are all non-trivial tasks that require knowledge of the existing site architecture and access to the site infrastructure. There are also minor features that matter to each of us in particular, but they are not always obvious for everyone else: automatic subscription to Wiki pages upon editing, various design improvements.

But the process of improvement has to solicit feedback in order to capture ideas about areas of improvement, and this channel for feedback should be easy to reach and visible to others. An example of such a channel is the online manual comments that one sees in the documentation for technologies such as PHP, MySQL [[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/multiple-tablespaces.html|(example)]] and PostgreSQL.

A lot of information causes frustration: that's why people prefer Twitter to Blogger. Too much "[[Inventory|inventory]]" in the room makes it hard to navigate and hard to notice needed things. The process of cleanup should involve throwing unused stuff away, leaving relevant and updated information in place. Naturally, the Wiki has accumulated lots of arguably unused and dated pages, but various python.org pages are affected as well. Too much information reduces the "fun factor": a separate status page will help people see what's going on and let them have more fun by focusing their work and enabling them to work together with others.

== Miscellaneous ==

 * Explain how to use .egg package archives.  As a new user, I am unable to find anything, but I do find .egg files in the package index.  
 * Fix webmaster@python.org response bug (per Issue:7929)
 * Add website repository to http://svn.python.org/view/
 * Badly need bug tracker for python.org website ([[http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/issue340|metatracker issue340]])
   * I wonder if roundup is better than some hosted solution -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-04-06T14:06:34Z)>>

== Web Site ==
 * CSS: Increase interval between list items to be the same as between lines - compare http://www.python.org/dev/doc/ and http://www.python.org/dev/pydotorg/
 * Add #pydotorg to http://python.org/community/irc/
 * Rename "Internet Relay Chat" in navigation menu to IRC as it is the preferred name most people look for
 * Add paragraph anchors to site generator
 * Add an RSS feed and/or mailing list for python security advisories
 * Add release timer and calendar to [[http://www.python.org/dev/|Core Development]] page
 * Have a '''report bug''' or '''suggest a change''' link leading to corresponding bug tracker (PythonWebsiteCreatingNewTickets wiki link) (issue Issue:8146)
 * http://www.python.org/download/windows/ should indicate latest supported Python for old versions of Microsoft systems (see issue Issue:8146)
 * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many people we're targeting.)
 * Add '''core development/source''' page with a table of

||<tablestyle="border: 1px solid #000;"> Python Version || ViewVC || SVN || Snapshot Download || Code Coverage || BuildBots ||
|| 2.7 || http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/ || http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk || http://svn.python.org/snapshots/ ||  ??? || ??? ||

== Wiki Content ==

 * Rename http://wiki.python.org/moin/ReStructuredText to http://wiki.python.org/moin/reStructuredText
 * Clean up CategoryJython 
 * Clean up Community/Python Writers page, above all: remove dead links 
   * How to scan DeadLinks in Python? -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-16T08:36:41Z)>>

 * Shorten URLs - remove /moin/ prefix from http://wiki.python.org/moin/SiteImprovements#Wiki
   * This requires moving Jython wiki from http://wiki.python.org/jython/ to http://wiki.jython.org/ and placing a temporary redirect on the previous places. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-16T08:39:34Z)>>

 * Rationalise the natural language coverage (merging the "new" language pages with the old ones)

== Wiki Theme ==

 * Upgrade the Python theme to the one used by [[http://wiki.europython.eu/|the EuroPython Wiki site]]
 (./) Now done by Radomir! -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-03T19:18:56+0100)>>
 * Remove rarely used links in Wiki menu in the left
   * (./) It looks like just the standard links are present now. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-03T19:18:56+0100)>>
 * Render table cells with border '''1px solid #000''' by default
   * (./) The new theme seems to fix this. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-03T19:18:56+0100)>>

== Wiki Engine ==

Some Wiki problems are likely to be related to bugs in MoinMoin or could be remedied by developing enhancements.

 * Enable the OpenID support

 * Add autolinking to python tracker, e.g. issue #1024, issue 1024, issue1024, bug 1024 and bug #123
   * (./) Added to InterWikiMap as `Issue`. For example: Issue:7942 in the tracker. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:32:26+0100)>>
   * Even though natural syntax would be more welcomed this is a nice helper. Are there any side effects if the prefix is added lowercased? Seems like is still not possible for it to show word "issue" automatically. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:47:59Z)>>
   * I'm just following the InterWiki conventions, really. I'm sure I should use `PythonIssue:xxx` instead, but I suppose `Issue:xxx` is unlikely to be used by accident. As for the prefix, it's only included in the title for the icon, I think. And as for autolinking, I think that would require a parser extension or modification. I'd personally be comfortable with a macro (like `<<PythonIssue(xxx)>>`), but then people would need to know how to use it, and it wouldn't obviously be natural to write. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T17:56:18+0100)>>

 * Add "automatically subscribe to pages I edit" plugin from http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinPatch/AutomaticSubscriptionOnEditPreference to increase people awareness about changes going on on the wiki.

 * '''Fix bug''' can't rename the page (A page with the name 'xxx' already exists. Try a different name.)
   * Can you give a walk-through of how to reproduce this? -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:44:04+0100)>>
     * Try to rename http://wiki.python.org/moin/ReStructuredText to http://wiki.python.org/moin/reStructuredText without being superuser

 * Remove annoying "captcha" for sane users who logged in
   * This just needs the feature to be [[HelpOnTextChas|configured properly]]. Then a system is required to add people to the exempt users list after their intentions have been verified. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:44:04+0100)>>
   * Is there an automatic group for users with 10 or more successful edits? -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-15T17:56:09Z)>>
   * I think it all has to be done manually. It would be quite easy for spammers to make accounts, perform edits manually and then automate more spamming. The MoinMoin:TextCha page has plenty of discussion about this, but I agree that it would be nicer to have some kind of workflow in the Wiki itself. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T20:21:55+0100)>>
   * It is easier for them to automate TextCha entry than enter it 10 times manually and in the end have their accounts banned. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-16T08:25:16Z)>> 

 * Add improved event calendar support such as that provided by [[http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/EventAggregator|EventAggregator]] or another similar extension

 * Switch to [[http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting|TracWiki syntax]]
   * Why? Trac's syntax, apart from the stuff that's identical to !MoinMoin's syntax, is like the old !MoinMoin syntax, and although it's better than !MediaWiki syntax in various ways (take the [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links|link syntax]] and its inconsistencies), switching to it would be like reverting a number of fixes that !MoinMoin applied when its syntax (particularly the [[MoinMoin:LinkPattern|link syntax]]) was changed in 1.6. I don't deny that bits of it can be complicated, but that's not usually the basic stuff. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T16:32:26+0100)>>
   * Using Trac for various Python (and not only Python) I got used to separate [http://links with description using space] - as it is more readable. I can't see where [MoinMoin:LinkPattern link syntax] will conflict with anything. Anyway it is the last point in this list. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-15T17:27:00Z)>>
   * I've become accustomed to the newer syntax now, and I think there's probably some reason why they moved away from the older syntax, possibly for extensibility reasons where spaces can appear naturally and confuse the process of isolating arguments. I've not been too impressed by the Wiki capabilities of Trac, but that might have something to do with the visually unimpressive styling of Trac for most installations and the lack of !MoinMoin conveniences, not the syntax as such. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-03-15T20:21:55+0100)>>
   * !MoinMoin is a general purpose wiki like MediaWiki and it may happen that old syntax created problems with porting content between them. However, for software projects, Trac and [[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax|Google Code]] were inspired by the old variant of markup and there is [[http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/list|no single ticket]] to switch to !MediaWiki. I would really like to see reasoning behind the choice in !MoinMoin 1.6, and know if there is a preference to turn on the old markup. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-03-16T08:20:29Z)>>
   * A good summary of why the syntax was changed was posted in an IRC conversation on the #moin channel, and I've uploaded it [[SiteImprovements/WikiSyntaxComparison|here]] -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-04-23T12:36:53+0100)>>

 * There should be a "Logout" link in the left navigation (Actions)
   * Don't you see a "Logout" link under "User" or are you not using the new (and awesome) default theme? -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2011-03-25T21:53:00+0100)>>
