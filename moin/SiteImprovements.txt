This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.

Aahz: 
    * While doing that re-org, perhaps the SIGs link ought to be moved
    and the Beginner's link replace it, with a prominent link on the
    Newbies page to "What is Python?"

    * HOW-TOs currently at http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/ should be
    moved to http://www.python.org/ (somewhere)

    * http://www.python.org/doc/Summary.html needs an update

    * http://www.python.org/psa/Users.html should be moved to a Wiki

    * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with
    a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many
    people we're targeting.)

    * http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html and
    http://www.python.org/UserGroups.html need to be re-organized,
    probably using a database so we can create multiple views.

AMK: 

 * doc/Intros.html: why two "What is Python?" links? ''For the especially clueless? :-)''

 * Too many introductions!  doc/Intros.html, doc/Introduction.html, doc/Newbies.html, doc/Hints.html.  Trim down this material and have one location for it.
