This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.

 * http://www.python.org/Jobs.html should be moved to a database with
   a secure and user-friendly front-end.  (Wikis won't do it for many
   people we're targeting.)

== Wiki ==
 * Add "automatically subscribe to pages I edit" plugin from http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinPatch/AutomaticSubscriptionOnEditPreference to increase people awareness about changes that going on on the wiki.
