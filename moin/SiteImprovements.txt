This page collects suggestions for improving the python.org web site.  Perhaps we'll 
manage to implement some of them at PyCon?

Aahz: I've been thinking (without much energy to do it) that the Community
link on the main page ought to point at a new page instead of the
incredibly stale PSA link. 

Aahz: While doing that re-org, perhaps the SIGs
link ought to be moved and the Beginner's link replace it, with a
prominent link on the Newbies page to "What is Python?"

AMK: 

* Suggested top links, in this order: "Home", "About", "Download", "Documentation", 
"Help", "Search".  That's 7 links, not 8; any suggestions for one more?

* The top page is too long.  Ideas to shorten it?

* doc/Intros.html: why two "What is Python?" links?
