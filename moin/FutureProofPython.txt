Python is a mature language, but it hasn't stopped evolving,
and there are some issues to consider when coding Python, if
you want your code to work with the latest version of Python
in five five years from now...

= New style classes =

Currently, there are two kinds of classes in Python. The 'classic'
or old style classes, and the new style classes. Old style classes
will go away in some future version, and while most code will still
work when the default swaps from old style to new style, there are
some differences in semantics, and the new style classes have some
extra features. See http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle.html

'''Use new style classes in new code'''

Don't write
{{{
class X:
    pass
}}}

Write
{{{
class X(object):
    pass
}}}
