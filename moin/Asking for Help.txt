  * Hi, I am new to Python from Java background, I have following structure
    {{{
/root

}}}

    I am in the folder2 and want to run class3.py but it need to import a module from Class1.py
    Could someone please help me?
  * I believe you just need to add folder1 to your path variable. Should be something along the lines of: import sys; sys.path.append('/root/folder1'); import Class1 (with ; replaced by newlines). If that doesn't work, look through the documentation for info on how the sys.path variable works--I may just have the syntax slightly off

  * Is there any way to get the environment from a subprocess.Popen created by python?  In other words, if the new process updates it's environment, is it possible to get access to the modifications.  For example In my case I'm executing MS Visual Studio's vsvars32.bat file and would like to access the modified PATH environment variable.

    {{{

-> 'a,b, c, d, e,f,h, i,j,k' # Ok for me

re.sub('"([^"]*)"', "|\g<1>|", x)
-> '|a,b|, c, d, |e,f,h|, |i,j,k|'   # To show the separation of the groups, also Ok

re.sub('"([^"]*)"', "\g<1>".replace(",", "|"), x)
-> 'a,b, c, d, e,f,h, i,j,k' # The same result!
-> 'a|b, c, d, e|f|h, i|j|k' # It doesn't suppose to replace all "," with "|" like here?
}}}

No, it is doing what you told it to do. To realize this you must know that arguments are evaluated before they are passed to the functions. But what is the value of "\g<1>".replace(",", "|")? "\g<1>", of course, as there are no commas to replace in "\g<1>". re.sub therefore receives '"([^"]*)"' and "\g<1>" as arguments, which is the exact equivalent of the first call.

 * Related question to the for-a-blink question in the answered section.  When running os.system(some command) the CMD.exe window pops up and then terminates when the process terminates. [[How do I get the contents of what was in that CMD.exe window saved someplace - variable, file, etc.]] Variable assignment doesn't work - only the exit code is in the variable.
  Seems to me you need to redirect the stdout. As per Python Library Reference 6.1.5., this is impossible for os.system() calls.

 *I'm a total Python newbie. How do I get Python started on a Palm handheld ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PalmPython ) ? Or should I focus on learning Python on a desktop PC first ? -- DavidCary
  I would recommend learning Python on a normal desktop system, with a recent version, a full suite of libraries, and [[http://ipython.scipy.org/|IPython]] (Interactive Python) installed.  After you've learned the basics then you can probably adapt more readily to the limitations of the Palm Pilot interface, implementation, version (older), and libraries (reduced subset).  [[JimD]]

 * How do you save python code and use it for anything? --elpenmaster
  Save it as "scriptName.py" and then execute it with the Python interpreter. As for choosing a purpose for the code, that's entirely up to you. -- PeytonMcCullough
   How do I save it as scriptname.py? --elpenmaster
    - it is possible to enter python commands into a text file, rather than entering them directly into the python shell. Simply create a text file containing your python instructions and save it as scriptname.py, you can then import it into a python shell session or execute it directly.

 *How do I publish Python modules?
  See PublishingPythonModules - [[Philip]], 2005-09-19

  [[lwickjr]]: My question, "my" page. I created that page, empty, in hopes that someone would populate it. They have, and I've read it. They hadn`t yet when I created *this* page for posting how-to questions, at about the same time, so I included the question here in the seed page. See the attachments to [[lwickjr| my page]] for my final solution to the problem. ;) By the way, "How to publish Python modules" has been renamed "PublishingPythonModules", to be more Wiki-style. [Me, again.] 2005-11-24.

 *i got winxp. i make a simple program like print "hello". i save it as whatever.py. then i double-click it. nothing happens just the windows cmd appears for a blink. Additionally you can go to Start -> Run, type 'cmd', and hit enter. Now cd to your foo.py file, and execute it.

  The Windows command window appears "for a blink" to show the output ("hello") before going away again - your program ends and the window closes. You can, of course, run the program from the command window (type "python whatever.py") to see the output, or you could make the program pause (using time.sleep) or wait for input (raw_input) before finishing - that would at least leave the command window open. Some operating systems leave command windows open after the program has finished, by the way.

 * This is an actual question.  I have have a prototype for a python related website.  Right now I am just running it off old PC (http://66.32.187.134).  Where could I host this site & and do you think this site would be helpful to the advancement of Python programming knowledge? Thanks. Father Jack

  * Father Jack, you should look at the [[PythonHosting]] page and consider some of the options presented there. Your site doesn't seem to be available, so it's hard to assess what its contribution to Python programming knowledge might be. -- PaulBoddie
