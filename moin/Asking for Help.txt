I'm a total Python newbie. How do I get Python started on a Palm handheld ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PalmPython ) ?
Or should I focus on learning Python on a desktop PC first ? -- DavidCary
 I would recommend learning Python on a normal desktop system, with a recent version, a full suite of libraries, and [http://ipython.scipy.org/ IPython] (Interactive Python) installed.  After you've learned the basics then you can probably adapt more readily to the limitations of the Palm Pilot interface, implementation, version (older), and libraries (reduced subset).  ["JimD"]
