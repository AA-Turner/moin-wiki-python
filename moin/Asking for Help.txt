 *Does anyone know why msOffice products (using win32com return) u'dana\u2019s best' rather than u'dana's best'?
  Microsoft Office replaces apostrophes (U+0027) with "Right Single Quotation Marks" (U+2019) automatically.  While this looks correct typograpphically, it might cause some problems.  -- IanBollinger

 *I'm a total Python newbie. How do I get Python started on a Palm handheld ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PalmPython ) ? Or should I focus on learning Python on a desktop PC first ? -- DavidCary
  I would recommend learning Python on a normal desktop system, with a recent version, a full suite of libraries, and [http://ipython.scipy.org/ IPython] (Interactive Python) installed.  After you've learned the basics then you can probably adapt more readily to the limitations of the Palm Pilot interface, implementation, version (older), and libraries (reduced subset).  ["JimD"]

 * How do you save python code and use it for anything? --elpenmaster
  Save it as "scriptName.py" and then execute it with the Python interpreter. As for choosing a purpose for the code, that's entirely up to you. -- PeytonMcCullough
   How do I save it as scriptname.py? --elpenmaster
    - it is possible to enter python commands into a text file, rather than entering them directly into the python shell. Simply create a text file containing your python instructions and save it as scriptname.py, you can then import it into a python shell session or execute it directly.

 *How do I publish Python modules?

  ["lwickjr"]: My question, "my" page. I created that page, empty, in hopes that someone would populate it. They have, and I've read it. They hadn`t yet when I created *this* page for posting how-to questions, at about the same time, so I included the question here in the seed page. See the attachments to [:lwickjr: my page] for my final solution to the problem. ;) By the way, "How to publish Python modules" has been renamed "PublishingPythonModules", to be more Wiki-style.
