 1. Read the Python developer guide: http://docs.python.org/devguide/
 1. Create an account on the Python bug tracker: http://bugs.python.org/
 1. Submit a patch for a Python bug (see the next section for help getting started)
 1. Let the core mentorship mailing list know that you've submitted your patch and are ready to work on your application. We'll craft an application together for a project that fits your background and interests and what you want to learn this summer!

= Submitting a patch for a Python bug =

== The tools of Python development ==

Before you submit a patch, here are some of the tools we use that you may want to review or practice:

 * IRC
 * bug trackers
 * the mercurial (hg) revision control system
 * the diff and patch utilities

=== IRC ===

IRC is a real-time group chat system popular with many open source projects. Developers ask questions and discuss patches on IRC, and users also ask questions on IRC.

Learn more about how Python uses IRC here: http://www.python.org/community/irc/.

There are 3 main Python IRC channels, all on the Freenode IRC network, that you may be interested in:

 1. `#python-dev`: for discussing the development of Python itself
 1. `#python`: for asking and answering general Python questions
 1. `#pyladies`: the main !PyLadies IRC channel


=== Bug trackers ===

Python tracks bugs and features at http://bugs.python.org/.

Please familiarize yourself with how Python uses its bug tracker by exploring and finding answers to the following questions:

 1. What is the oldest open Python ticket?
 1. How many open issues need a patch?
 1. How many "critical"-level open issues are there?

=== Mercurial ===

Mercurial is the distributed version control system Python uses to manages changes to its code.

If you have not used Mercurial before, please go through this tutorial: http://hginit.com/

=== diff and patch ===

If you have not used diff and patch before, please go through the diff and patch training mission at:  

http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch
