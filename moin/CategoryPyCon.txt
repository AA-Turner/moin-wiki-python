== Generated Page List ==

This list is uses a simple Wiki search to find pages related to PyCon.  It 
should be more comprehensive than the list maintained by hand above, but it 
is almost certainly more random.

(Note that some of the above pages may actually be in the CategoryPyConSpeakerPage, 
not the CategoryPyCon.)

= Justification For This Page =

We need to make it easy for the community to contribute and participate 
in preparations for the PyCon.  Wikis can be difficult to navigate.  If 
a user wants to start a page about PyCon hotel reservations, he might 
not notice the PyConAccommodation page.  This category can provide a 
central place for users to find the right page where they should add their 
content.  If we use this category consistently, then the community may 
feel more comfortable adding to existing pages or adding pages that 
seem to be lacking.

Another reason for this category pages is to prevent pages from becoming orphaned. 
When refactoring a Wiki page, it is possible to remove the last link to a page.  
This category page should provide a link to all pages still claiming to be part 
of the CategoryPyCon without having to check OrphanedPages.

That's the hope at least! :-)
