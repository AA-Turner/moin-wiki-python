= Justification For This Page =

We need to make it easy for the community to contribute and participate 
in preparations for the PyCon.  Wikis can be difficult to navigate.  If 
a user wants to start a page about PyCon hotel reservations, he might 
not notice the PyConAccomodation page.  This category can provide a 
central place for users to find the right page where they should add their 
content.  If we use this category consistently, then the community may 
feel more comfortable adding to existing pages or adding pages that 
seem to be lacking.

That's the hope at least! :)
