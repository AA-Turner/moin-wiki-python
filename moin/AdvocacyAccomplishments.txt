Advocacy Accomplishments (most recent at top)
----

 * '''2007/05/14''' Created a [http://python-groups.blogspot.com/ blog to be shared] by the organizers of various usergroups in making announcements and giving meeting reports.  Have not yet requested for it to be added to an aggregator nor added to www.python.org.
 * '''2007/05/14''' Issued call to community for updates to [http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining the list of Python trainers] and also added an entry to the left menu of www.python.org for "Training Classes".
 * '''2007/05/14''' Issued call to community for four code samples for Forrester Survey.
 * '''2007/05/12''' Member of DFW Pythoneers, Brad Allen, is on extended business in Portland Oregon, and he has been working to restart their local Python usergroup.  He paid for a year of http://python.meetup.com/183 and has convened two meetings, the first with 5 people, the second with 8.  He has also made contact with the local Plone usergroup and is working to build a Portland leadership before he has to return to Dallas.
 * '''2007/05/12''' 2nd Saturday meeting of the DFW Pythoneers, wherein I presented on D-BUS and showed [http://trac.gajim.org/wiki/GajimDBus how to hook events coming from the Jabber IM client Gajim].  We had a new attendee from the Dallas Personal Robotics Group, which is developing some interest in using Python with robots, as M.I.T. is doing.  Fortunately Martin Thomas had brought his [http://www.tuxisalive.com/ TuxDroid], which is controlled with Python and which he had turned into a service on the D-BUS, to be controlled by any application.  We didn't quite make it to having the [http://www.tuxisalive.com/ TuxDroid] controlled from the Gajim jabber client, both D-BUS participants.
 * '''2007/05/10''' Issued call to Python community for help with 11 answers to Forrester Survey.  Some responses received but not much content so will need to research the answers myself, due to short deadline of May 18th..
 * '''2007/05/09''' Received working copies of select chapters of the college textbook "Understanding Computers", for reworking for the 12th edition.  The work done for the 11th edition was just updating a few pages, while the 12th edition the publisher staff are allowed to do major rewrites of sections so Python will get higher visibility.
 * '''2007/05/08''' Continually collecting [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy/VideoLectures quality video lectures] for use by fledgling usergroups or others.  Oddly there are not that many around it seems.  Hopefully the ones from PyCon 2007, once processed, will help here.
 * '''2007/05/04''' Participated in a teleconference with Forrester Research staff, wherein they reviewed their overall philosophy of how they conduct a survey and what can be done with it afterward.  There was also a good question and answer exchange among representatives of the various dynamic languages in the call.
 * '''2007/05/03''' Reviewed the [http://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Draft.xls draft criteria] and gave [http://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Feedback.txt detailed feedback] to Forrester Research about the criteria to be used in their survey of dynamic languages.  The final survey form now looks like [http://dfwpython.org/uploads/Forrester/DynamicLanguagesCriteria--Final.xls this].  The survey has aggressive completion dates and involves interviews with selection community members, the names of which I am submitting.  It also needs four samples of source code for specific problems, as well as essay-style answers, which I am handling myself.  I've asked the community for help with the source code samples.
 * '''2007/04/26''' Spent time learning Andrew's new scheme for content on www.python.org and created [http://www.python.org/doc/av/ a section for audiovisual materials], to be developed in cooperation with [http://www.showmedo.com].  The section has not yet been added to the main menu, pending creation/processing of new screencasts.  There is also [http://www.python.org/doc/av/5minutes/ a subsection for the viewing of in-page videos].  These are where the "5 Minutes with Python" series of screencasts will go.
 * '''2007/04/25''' Worked on outline for paper, "[http://wiki.python.org/moin/AdvocacyWritingTasks/StartingAUserGroup Starting and Running a Successful Python User Group]"
 * '''2007/04/25''' Some cleanup and rework of [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy the Advocacy wiki page] but more is needed.
 * '''2007/04/25''' The [http://wiki.python.org/moin/OmahaPythonUserGroup Omaha Python Usergroup] provided [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy/UsergroupSupport a sample tearaway flyer], for reuse by other groups.
 * '''2007/04/25''' Convened an online meeting with the [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Advocacy/UsergroupSupport/Committee Usergroup Support Committee], a small group of community members to provide input and take on some of the tasks of strengthening the usergroups of Python.  This committee has a private mailing list <usergroup-advocacy@python.org>.  The IM transcript of this meeting is online [http://dfwpython.org/uploads/Advocacy/usergroup-committee-minutes-20070425.txt here].
 * '''2007/04/19''' Created a mailing list, <group-organizers@python.org>: "To share knowledge, of what works and doesn't work in running a vibrant Python usergroup. We seek members of existing usergroups to share their expertise and those who wish to start a usergroup near them and want help in getting started."  This list has not yet been publicly announced, pending a blog to go along with it.
 * '''2007/04/15''' Performed some auditing of existing roster of usergroups, noting dead links and building up a local spreadsheet of information.  Much more is needed here.
 * '''2007/04/11''' Received complimentary paper copy of college textbook "Understanding Computers", 11th edition, that now includes mention of Python.

 * '''2006/11/08''' Implemented a [http://advocacy.python.org/docs/dept-careers.3600.en.1 web viewlet/component], under the Careers tab, that polls monster.com and dice.com once each day and plots the count of Python-specific job openings; retains up to 5 years of data.

 * '''2006/10/28''' Presented a 2-hr code walkthru of [https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/advocacy.python.org/ the underlying structure of the advocacy portal] to the DFW Pythoneers, getting feedback and ideas.
 * '''2006/10/27''' Coordinated with the PyCon graphic designer negotiating contract, getting it signed and so forth; we now have a photo montage at the top of [http://us.pycon.org us.pycon.org] although we're still looking for good photos.
 * '''2006/10/20''' Worked short list of keynote speakers and got speaking commitments; we have [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/Keynotes 3 firm] and 2 more candidates if our schedule has room.

 * '''2006/10/14''' Prototyped up and did a code walkthru for the DFW Pythoneers showing how Python programs can participate on the D-BUS (desktop bus for Unix), querying and altering the hardware (such as detecting USB plug-in events and altering the laptop LCD brightness) using HAL.  Also showed how to use the notification-daemon on D-BUS to pop-up balloon help and a brief touch on the wireless services provided by Avahi (zeroconf/rendevous) on the D-BUS.  This talk came about as a result of my PyCon research into a possible One-Laptop-Per-Child keynote, where that project uses much of this same technology.  [http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2006/10/tech-walkthru-d-bus-hal-notify-and.html Blogged].
 * '''2006/10/12''' Reviewed the slogans for PyCon with the attendees of the DFW Pythoneers social, collecting input on how and what to select.  We also discussed what we'd like to see at PyCon and how we could, individually, lead threads on comp.lang.python and other forums to encourage speakers to step forward.
 * '''200610/12''' Worked on a [http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/TalkIdeas list of PyCon talk ideas], adding outlines to some, posting to comp.lang.python and comp.lang.python.announce.  Also blogged the calls ([http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2006/10/call-for-members-of-panels-on-web.html here] and [http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2006/10/call-for-presenter-on-python-eggs.html here]) for talks and tutorials but I suspect those didn't get out because it was before any blog aggregators had picked me up.  I have gotten a good offer for a talk about eggs, and a confirmed solid candidate for a keynote speaker.
 * '''2006/10/05''' Gave a 60-min presentation at the local DFW Unix Users Group about dynamic languages and Python, as a follow-on to the main presentation given by Dave Thomas about Ruby and Rails.  [http://www.dfwpython.org/static/DFWUUG_AboutPython/AboutPython.html My slides] are available on the club website, in [http://www.dfwpython.org/static/DFWUUG_AboutPython/AboutPython.txt docutils/restructured-text S5 format].
