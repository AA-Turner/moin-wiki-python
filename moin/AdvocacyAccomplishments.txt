Advocacy Accomplishments (most recent at top)
----

 * '''2006/10/14''' Prototyped up and did a code walkthru for the DFW Pythoneers showing how Python programs can participate on the D-BUS (desktop bus for Unix), querying and altering the hardware (such as detecting USB plug-in events and altering the laptop LCD brightness) using HAL.  Also showed how to use the notification-daemon on D-BUS to pop-up balloon help and a brief touch on the wireless services provided by Avahi (zeroconf/rendevous) on the D-BUS.  This talk came about as a result of my PyCon research into a possible One-Laptop-Per-Child keynote, where that project uses much of this same technology.  [[Blogged -> http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com]].
 * '''2006/10/12''' Reviewed the slogans for PyCon with the attendees of the DFW Pythoneers social, collecting input on how and what to select.  We also discussed what we'd like to see at PyCon and how we could, individually, lead threads on comp.lang.python and other forums to encourage speakers to step forward.
 * '''2006/10/05''' Gave a 60-min presentation at the local DFW Unix Users Group about dynamic languages and Python, as a follow-on to the main presentation given by Dave Thomas about Ruby and Rails.  [[My slides -> http://www.dfwpython.org/static/DFWUUG_AboutPython/AboutPython.html]] are available on the club website, in [[docutils/restructured-text S5 format -> http://www.dfwpython.org/static/DFWUUG_AboutPython/AboutPython.txt]].  I'd guess the audience size was roughly 15-20 people.  [[Blogged -> http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2006/10/group-discussion-about-dynamic.html]]
