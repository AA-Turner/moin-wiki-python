= Computed Attributes, Using Property Objects =

John Posner

This document describes computed attributes and introduces the easiest way to
implement computed attributes in Python: using '''property''' objects.

== Kinds of Attributes ==

In Python, an object's contents are accessed as '''attributes''', using
dot-notation. Some attributes provide access to stored data: integers, strings,
lists, user- or system-defined objects, etc:

{{{
wgt.color
employee.first_name
team.positions
}}}

Other attributes provide access to functions (more correctly in this context:
"methods"), which can be called with an argument list to execute code:

{{{
wgtlist.darkest_color()
employee.full_name(salutation=True, caps=False)
team.best_hitter(baseball.SLUGGING)
}}}

Python also provides a mechanism for blurring the distinction between these
standard ways of using attributes. A '''computed attribute''' (or "managed
attribute") ''looks like'' it directly accesses storage, but ''works like'' a
function. That is, you code a computed attribute without parentheses or
arguments, but accessing the attribute causes a function to be executed. Example:

  If `color` is a computed attribute of object `wgt`, then in these statements ...

  {{{
save_me = wgt.color
top_edge_color = (255,) + wgt.color[1:]
  }}}

  . ... evaluating `wgt.color` causes a function to be invoked. The function's
  return value is used in the right-hand-side expression.

The easiest way to implement a computed attribute is with an object of type
'''property''', introduced in Python 2.2. Depending on the way you access a
property object, it dispatches a function to perform either a "get the value"
operation or a "set the value" operation (or even "delete the attribute"). You
specify the dispatch functions when you create the property object; it's up to
you to ensure that the work they do makes sense. The following diagram
illustrates how a property works.

== Creating a Computed Attribute ==

Here's a scenario that calls for a computed attribute that implements "get the
value" and "set the value" operations ... To model your company's widgets,
which come in a variety of colors, you use a class named `Widget`, with
instance attribute `color`:

{{{
class Widget(object):
    def __init__(self, arg=None):
        if arg:
            self.color = arg
        else:
            self.color = (0,0,0)
}}}

In the past, all Widget colors were specified as ''(R,G,B)'' tuples, so
programs could make simple references to, and assignments to, the `color`
attribute. But now, there's a business need to support colors specified as
''#rrggbb'' strings, also. Management decides that a Widget object must store
the color in its originally specified format (string or tuple), but must always
report the color as an ''(R,G,B)'' tuple. Moreover, existing programs using the
`color` attribute must continue to work, without modification.

These requirements can be handled by turning `color` into a computed attribute:

 * At the instance level, rename the attribute that stores the color value, from `self.color` to `self.color_data`. This frees up the attribute name `color`.

 * At the class level, assign the attribute name `color` to a property object that can dispatch two functions, `get_color` and `set_color`.

The following code implements `get_color` and `set_color` as methods of
the Widget class. Alternatively (but less object-orientedly), they could be
implemented as functions outside the class definition.

{{{
class Widget(object):
    def __init__(self, arg=None):
        if arg:
            self.color_data = arg
        else:
            self.color_data = (0,0,0)

    def get_color(self):
        if type(self.color_data) is tuple:
            return self.color_data
        else:
            return str_to_tuple(self.color_data)

    def set_color(self, arg):
        self.color_data = arg

    # create property object to dispatch 'get' and 'set' methods
    # NOTE: "color" is a class attribute, not an instance attribute
    color = property(get_color, set_color)
}}}

The `get_color` method uses a utility function, `str_to_tuple`:

{{{
def str_to_tuple(color_string):
    return (int(color_string[1:3], 16),   # red
            int(color_string[3:5], 16),   # green
            int(color_string[5:], 16))    # blue
}}}

Now, when a program makes a reference to the attribute `color` through a Widget
instance `wgt`, the property object dispatches `get_color`, which retrieves the
`color_data` value and returns an ''(R,G,B)'' tuple. Similarly, when a program
makes an assignment to the attribute `color`:

{{{
wgt.color = "#ff80ff"
}}}

.... the property object dispatches `set_color` with the argument `"#ff80ff"`,
causing the value to be stored in `color_data`.

Some coding details:

 * The property object must be assigned to a class attribute. (This assignment gives the computed attribute its name; the property object itself doesn't know the name of the computed attribute that it implements.) The property "performs" as a computed attribute only when it is accessed through an instance of the class. Working at Python's interactive prompt shows this:

 {{{
>>> Widget.color
<property object at 0x00D8F5A0>
>>> Widget("#1020fe").color
(16, 32, 254)
 }}}

 * When an attribute reference causes the property object to dispatch `get_color`, the Widget instance is passed as the sole argument to this function.

 * When an assignment statement causes the property object to dispatch `set_color`, two arguments are passed to this function: the Widget instance, and the statement's right-hand-side value.

== References ==

We haven't finished the story on property objects -- for example, we haven't discussed how to 
implement a computed attribute that handles the statement `del wgt.color`. But if you've gotten this far, it probably makes sense to switch to the official '''property''' documentation:

 [[http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#property]]

Or see a revision of the official documentation, at [[AlternativeDescriptionOfProperty]].
 
(Don't get fooled -- as I was! -- by the classification of '''property''' in the documentation as a built-in function. '''property''' is a built-in data type, like '''int'''. In Python, data types are directly callable, and so look like functions.)
