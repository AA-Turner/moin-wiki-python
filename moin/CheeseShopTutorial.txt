= What the Cheese Shop Stores =

The Python Cheese Shop stores [http://docs.python.org/dist/meta-data.html information about packages of Python software]. Each package has a name and a number of release versions. The list of release versions will increase as newer versions of the package are submitted to the Cheese Shop.

= Submitting Packages to the Cheese Shop =

There are two types of information that may be submitted to the Cheese Shop:

 1. package meta-data (name, version, description, etc), and

 2. package source and binary distribution files.

== Package Meta-Data ==

You may submit package meta-data either by:

 1. writing a [http://docs.python.org/dist/setup-script.html setup.py file] and using "python setup.py register" (see [http://docs.python.org/dist/package-index.html docs]),

 2. creating a PKG-INFO file (typically generated from a setup.py file) and uploading it, or

 3. using the [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form web form] and manually entering the information.

The Cheese Shop assumes that the PKG-INFO file is either ASCII or UTF-8.

=== Selecting Classifiers ===

View the complete [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers list of classifiers] you may choose from.

See the [http://docs.python.org/dist/meta-data.html meta-data docs] for details about how to include them in your setup.py file.

=== Missing Classifier? ===

Is a classifier you need missing from the [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers classifiers list]?

Python frameworks with plugins or packages that target the framework can get their own category. The category should only be added ''after'' such packages exist.

Complimentary packages can link to each other from their descriptions, they do not need a category to link them together; only when packages are provided by different people does a category need to be created.

To ask for a category email catalog-sig@python.org.

== Package Distribution Files ==

Note that submitting a package distribution file automatically submits the package's meta-data. You may submit package distribution files either by:

 1. appending the "upload" command to a setup.py [http://docs.python.org/dist/source-dist.html source dist] or [http://docs.python.org/dist/built-dist.html built dist] command, eg "python setup.py sdist upload", or

 2. logging into the Cheese Shop and using the package management interface to manually upload files.

The "upload" command has a number of options, including being able to sign the upload using GPG. See "python setup.py upload --help" for more information.

== Exposing Multiple Releases ==

When a new release of a package is submitted to the Cheese Shop, all previous releases of that package are ''hidden'' from the display. This means that listings and searches will no longer find those releases.

You may use the package admin interface to ''uh-hide'' releases. This may be useful if you have both a ''stable'' and a ''development'' release active at the same time. These will be hidden again on the next submission of meta-data.
