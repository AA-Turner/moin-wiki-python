= Submitting Packages to the Cheese Shop =

There are two types of information that may be submitted to the Cheese Shop:

 1. package meta-data (name, version, description, etc), and

 2. package source and binary distribution files.

== Package Meta-Data ==

You may submit package meta-data either by:

 1. writing a [http://docs.python.org/dist/setup-script.html setup.py file] and using "python setup.py register" (see [http://docs.python.org/dist/package-index.html docs]),

 2. creating a PKG-INFO file (typically generated from a setup.py file) and uploading it, or

 3. using the [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form web form] and manually entering the information.


== Package Distribution Files ==

You may submit package distribution files either by:

 1. appending the "upload" command to a setup.py [http://docs.python.org/dist/source-dist.html source dist] or [http://docs.python.org/dist/built-dist.html built dist] command, eg "python setup.py sdist upload", or

 2. logging into the Cheese Shop and using the package management interface to manually upload files.

The "upload" command has a number of options, including being able to sign the upload using GPG. See "python setup.py upload --help" for more information.
