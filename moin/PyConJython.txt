== Jython track at PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! ==

Hm...judging by the PyConSchedule, there won't be much Jython discussion in the 
official talks.  Perhaps we can organize some BoFs or OpenSpace discussions at 
the conference.

== Jython topics ==

Add your own ideas.  

 * Intro to Jython (I have an outline for this topic. -TAB)
 * Introducing Jython to a Java development team.  
 * Differences between Jython and Python
 * Embedding Jython in a Java application. (submitted -aeden)
 * Using Jython in J2EE development.
 * Jython development tools: editing, debugging, etc.
 * Scripting Java with Jython
 * Inside the Jython interpreter 
 * Extending Jython with Java code

== Jython BOF ==

We did end up having a Jython BOF on Friday, March 28, at 9 a.m.  It was attended by 
about a dozen people (add your name if you feel like it).  Since the theme of the
conference was "Popularizing Python," much of the discussion centered around how Jython 
is used and how that could help popularize Python.  We have started a CategoryJython 
page on this wiki to help track issues related to Jython.

I was at the Jython BOF: 
 * TomBryan -- I scheduled the BOF. :)
