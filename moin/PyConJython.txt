== Jython track at PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! ==

I don't have too much to say here, but I'm very interested in a Jython track.  
I'm hoping that the existence of this page will attract enough attention, 
interest, and organizational aupport that we can make Jython an important 
part of PyCon DC 2003.  In fact, if the conference had a Jython track, I would 
be more likely to attend.  (I even submitted an abstract for a talk about 
introducing Jython for a Java development shop.)  My main job involves Java 
development, and I haven't done too much with Jython.  What I've seen has 
impressed me with its potential, and I can't believe Jython hasn't become 
Python's "killer app" that spreads the language to the large existing base of 
Java developers.  

So, anyone else up for a Jython track?  What topics interest you?  Start a list!

----

Sad, no one has responded since I created the page on Dec. 19.  I guess I'll start.

== Show of interest ==

Maybe we just don't have sufficient interest for a whole Jython track.  Please add 
your name to the list so that we can judge the level of interest.

 * I'm interested in the Jython track.  -TAB

== Jython track topics ==

Add your own ideas.  Put your name down by a topic if you've actually sent in a 
submission on one of these topics to the committee.

 * Intro to Jython
 * Introducing Jython to a Java development team.  (submitted -TAB)
 * Differences between Jython and Python
 * Embedding Jython in a Java application.
 * Using Jython in J2EE development.
 * Jython development tools: editing, debugging, etc.
 * Scripting Java with Jython
 * Inside the Jython interpreter 
 * Extending Jython with Java code

Some of these could also be lightening talks instead of full presentations.

== Jython specific sprint ideas ==

 * Attacking some "Jython should be fixed" items on [http://www.jython.org/docs/differences.html Jython page] (may be mixed Java and Python development)
 * Tinkering with the Jython interpreter (would be mostly Java development)
