== Jython track at PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! ==

I don't have too much to say here, but I'm very interested in a Jython track.  
I'm hoping that the existence of this page will attract enough attention, 
interest, and organizational aupport that we can make Jython an important 
part of PyCon DC 2003.  In fact, if the conference had a Jython track, I would 
be more likely to attend.  (I even submitted an abstract for a talk about 
introducing Jython for a Java development shop.)  My main job involves Java 
development, and I haven't done too much with Jython.  What I've seen has 
impressed me with its potential, and I can't believe Jython hasn't become 
Python's "killer app" that spreads the language to the large existing base of 
Java developers.  

So, anyone else up for a Jython track?  What topics interest you?  Start a list!

----

Hm...judging by the PyConSchedule, there won't be much Jython discussion in the 
official talks.  Perhaps we can organize some BoFs or OpenSpace discussions at 
the conference.

== Show of interest ==

Please add your name to the list so that we can judge whether we have enough 
interest to plan a BoFs or OpenSpace discussion.

 * I'm interested, and I will definitely be at PyCon.  -TAB
 * I too am interested and will be there.  --Geoffrey Knauth

== Jython topics ==

Add your own ideas.  

 * Intro to Jython (I have an outline for this topic. -TAB)
 * Introducing Jython to a Java development team.  
 * Differences between Jython and Python
 * Embedding Jython in a Java application. (submitted -aeden)
 * Using Jython in J2EE development.
 * Jython development tools: editing, debugging, etc.
 * Scripting Java with Jython
 * Inside the Jython interpreter 
 * Extending Jython with Java code

== Jython specific sprint ideas ==

How about sprinting?  Anyone interested in a Jython-related sprint?  
Here are some ideas for sprint topics.  If we want to do a Jython 
sprint, we'll need to organize it and make it part of the official 
SprintPlan.

 * Attacking some "Jython should be fixed" items on [http://www.jython.org/docs/differences.html Jython page] (may be mixed Java and Python development)
 * Tinkering with the Jython interpreter (would be mostly Java development)
