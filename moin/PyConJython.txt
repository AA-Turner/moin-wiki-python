== Jython track at PyCon DC 2003 - Build Your Own Conference!!!! ==

I don't have too much to say here, but I'm very interested in a Jython track.  
I'm hoping that the existence of this page will attract enough attention, 
interest, and organizational aupport that we can make Jython an important 
part of PyCon DC 2003.  In fact, if the conference had a Jython track, I would 
be more likely to attend.  (I even submitted an abstract for a talk about 
introducing Jython for a Java development shop.)  My main job involves Java 
development, and I haven't done too much with Jython.  What I've seen has 
impressed me with its potential, and I can't believe Jython hasn't become 
Python's "killer app" that spreads the language to the large existing base of 
Java developers.  

So, anyone else up for a Jython track?  What topics interest you?  Start a list!
