= Outreachy with Python =

[[https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/|Outreachy]] is a program to help people from underrepresented communities get involved in free and open source software by providing .  Python is participating for this first time this year!

Python is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to get things done quickly and effectively.  In this spirit, many of our projects this year are about helping make Python faster!

== Ideas ==

Our primary mentor has offered up 3 ideas that she's most excited about:

 1. Develop a unified performance benchmark suite that’s acceptable for both Cpython & PyPy communities.

 2. Analyze the GUPB(Grand Unified Python Benchmarks) for which PyPy’s performance is worse than CPython and see if there is any scope for improvement ( ex: try and replicate cpython  methodology)

 3. Improving [[https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer|JitViewer]] (a profiling tool for PyPy) – capable to attach to a running process.


More details on these coming soon!
