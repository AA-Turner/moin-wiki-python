PySimpleGUI is a python library that wraps tkinter, Qt (pyside2), wxPython and Remi (for browser support), allowing very fast and simple-to-learn GUI programming. PySimpleGUI defaults to using tkinter, but the user can change to another supported GUI library by just changing one line.

PySimpleGUI can be installed using 'pip install pysimplegui' or by copying the file 'pysimplegui.py' from the github repository

PySimpleGUI is free/libre/open source software, licensed under GNULGPL 3.0

PySimpleGUI's main developer (mike@pysimplegui.org) currently does not accept pull requests via github, only issues.

It is possible to support PySimpleGUI's main developer via donations (links on the github page)
