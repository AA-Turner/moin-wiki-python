This proposal is about improving the workflow of core developers, probably with small glue scripts. As each developer has his own personal workflow, these helper scripts should be optional, easy to extend and aimed at the most common tasks.

Identifying which tasks and steps should be optimized cannot be left to the student nor to the mentor, it must be a collective effort. Clear goals must be set before someone try to implement them.

Besides some experience with Python and tools of the trade (VCSs, bug trackers, etc.), the most important requisite for a student working on this is being able to listen to the community and taking criticism well.

At least one core Python developer should mentor, preferably one that knows how to interact well with python-dev. Ali Afshar from PIDA is willing to mentor. Daniel Diniz is available to help with the Python workflow part that touches Roundup and Rietveld.
