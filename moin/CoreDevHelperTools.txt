This wiki page has one simple goal, and will strive with its whole heart to fulfill it. In these weird times, when certain people tend to eat, sleep, hang out with their partners and play football, they want to use the little time they have for development as effective as possible. Sometimes its just simple things that make our hacker life more enjoyable, like setting up your hg identity in one line. Sometimes its a more complex concept that we have to break into pieces, and make it simpler. Hacking should be more enjoyable, we should have more time for whatever we want to do, we should eliminate time-waste on repetitive tasks.

Guiding thought: "With all the sand and sun on the beaches, should I really be doing this now?"
