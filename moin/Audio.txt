You probably want PythonAudioMaterial

Or you may be looking for: [http://docs.python.org/lib/module-audioop.html] or more information about audio programming with Python (''I'' was).

Some Admin should probably fix http://www.python.org/doc/ to go there.

Alternatively, you might want to learn about audio programming in Python.  There is a veritable forest of stuff out there, but here are some good starting points:

Have a nice day. Move along.
