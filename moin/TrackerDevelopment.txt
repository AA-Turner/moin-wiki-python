= Getting Your Own python-dev Tracker =

This page describes how to setup a roundup tracker instance that works
exactly as the tracker for python-dev on http://bugs.python.org. The
intended audience is people that want to help out with the tracker,
developing new features etc.

= Requirements =

 * Roundup, from the vendor branch used for python-dev (see below).

 * PostgreSQL for use as backend database.

 * Installation of psycopg.

 * A checkout of the spambayes_integration.

 * A checkout of the python-dev instance from python's subversion    repository.

== Installing roundup ==

For python-dev, we use a slighly modified version of roundup which has
some features that are not yet in the core roundup. To keep track of
the changes, we keep a vendor branch of roundup.

Check out /tracker/roundup-src from the python subversion
repository as documented on http://python.org/dev/tools/. For
example, here's how to do anonymous checkout:

{{{
  svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/tracker/roundup-src
}}}

Install this roundup somewhere by running setup.py

{{{
  cd roundup-src
  python setup.py install --prefix /opt/tracker-roundup/
}}}

== Install and configure PostgreSQL ==

For the python-dev tracker instance we use PostgreSQL as backend
database. Roundup has support for many different databases for backend
(anydbm, metakit, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite...), but for the python-dev
instance, PostgreSQL was selected as it has the best performance for
large installations. Also, for performance reasons, there is at least
one place in the python-dev instance that has a hardcoded dependency
on the backend being an SQL-based one, so you do need PostgreSQL even
for development work (another SQL-based backend might work, but this
has not been tested). I recommend that you run postgreSQL to make your
development environment behave exactly like the environment the real
tracker runs in.

Details on how to install PostgreSQL is outside the scope of this Wiki
Page. Both version 7.4 and 8.1 of PostgreSQL has been tested without
any known problems.

Access configuration of postgresql can be tricky. You need to make
sure that the user you're running roundup as (your unix/windows user)
has access to the postgresql database you intend to use for roundup,
as the postgresql user you've configured in roundup's configuration.

For a development environment with no demands on security, the easiest
way to configure this is probably to allow all users to connect as any
database user as long as the request originates from the local
host. This can be accomplished by the following lines in pg_hba.conf:

{{{
local   all         all                                             trust
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
}}}

'''PLEASE NOTE''': This is not a secure configuration on a multi-user
machine.

After the change in pg_hba.conf, reload your postgreSQL database to
make sure it knows about your new access
configuration. Something similar to ''/etc/init.d/postgresql reload''
should do the trick on Unix-like platforms.

Create a database user that is allowed to create databases. This user
will be used when roundup connects to the database.

{{{
# psql -U postgres
postgres=# create user roundup;
postgres=# alter user roundup with createdb;
}}}

== Installing psycopg or psycopg2 ==

You need to install psycopg or psycopg2. Download it from http://www.initd.org.

== Checkout spambayes_integration ==

Even if you don't intend to use the !SpamBayes detector you must still check out the {{{spambayes_integration}}} instance.  If you do intend to use it, you will need to also install !SpamBayes proper and configure it appropriately (see below).

{{{
  svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/tracker/instances/spambayes_integration
}}}

== Checkout and Configure your Development Roundup Instance ==

The python-dev tracker instance is version-controlled with subversion,
and resides in the python subversion repository.

{{{
  svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/tracker/instances/python-dev
}}}

Now enter the python-dev directory, and create the 'db' directory (not
in svn as it's just to much fuzz to keep it there - every time you run
''roundup-admin init'' it is removed and recreated, confusing svn who
wants to keep its .svn directory intact), as well as the
db/backend_name file which decides which backend (i.e. database type)
to use:

{{{
cd python-dev
mkdir db
echo postgresql > db/backend_name
}}}

Copy python-dev/config.ini.template into config.ini, and modify it
according to your site. Pay special attention to settings marked with
''NO DEFAULT''. However, if you've configure your PostgreSQL as above,
most settings should be OK.

If you need to do development on the busybody or tellteam detectors,
copy detectors/config.ini.template into detectors/config.ini, and
adjust the e-mail addresses accordingly.

For python-dev instance, you need to disable the audit2to3 detector by returning from init() in detectors/audit2to3.py . Note that this is only a temporary solution before a graceful fix is available. 

Initialize your roundup instance:

{{{
/opt/tracker-roundup/bin/roundup-admin -i <your python-dev directory> init
}}}

Provide a password for the 'admin' user when asked for.

Start your roundup instance:

{{{
/opt/tracker-roundup/bin/roundup-server -p 9999 python-dev=<your python-dev directory>
}}}

You should now be able to browse http://localhost:9999/python-dev/ and
get a roundup instance that looks just like http://bugs.python.org.

== SpamBayes Setup ==

If you intend to use the !SpamBayes detector to weed out spam from your tracker you will need to install it and start an instance of its {{{core_server}}} application.
Briefly:

 * Download and install at least version 1.1a4 of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/spambayes SpamBayes source] from !SourceForge.  If you are running on Windows '''do not''' use the binary installer!
 * Establish a basic configuration, e.g.:
{{{
Devote a directory to it, e.g.:

 SBDIR=/usr/local/spambayes/core_server  # or whatever...
 mkdir -p $SBDIR

Create an INI file:

 cd $SBDIR
 cat > bayescustomize.ini <<EOF
[globals]
verbose:False

[Headers]
include_evidence:True
include_score:True

[Storage]
persistent_storage_file:$SBDIR/hammie.db
persistent_use_database:pickle
messageinfo_storage_file:$SBDIR/messageinfo.fs

[html_ui]
display_score:True
EOF

Finally, run it:

 BAYESCUSTOMIZE=$SBDIR/bayescustomize.ini core_server.py -m XMLRPCPlugin
}}}
 * If you are seeing image spam (this seems not to be a problem with wiki spam - yet), download and install [http://jocr.sourceforge.net/ GOCR]. 

== Getting Help ==

Subscribe to and ask your question on the tracker-discuss mailing list. See http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tracker-discuss

== Learn more About the Importer(s) ==

http://svn.python.org/projects/tracker/importer/README.rst has some information about the importer(s) written to convert sourceforge data into roundup data.

== Common Problems ==

 Incomplete/Missing !SpamBayes setup:: In your config.ini file set {{{spambayes_uri}}} to a syntactically valid, but nonexistent URI, e.g.:

{{{
    spambayes_uri = "http://localhost:9999/nobodyhere"
}}}
