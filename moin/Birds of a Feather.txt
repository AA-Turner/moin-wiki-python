The following birds-of-a-feather sessions are being planned:

* `Zope Foundation <http://foundation.zope.org>`_ members BoF
* `BeerBoF`_: Noble Python programmers will set off in search of the Chicago's rare "local micros".  Upon encountering the **beers**, the coders will consume them with great vigor.
* `ClimbBoF`_:  Let's find a local climbing gym to feed our addiction and talk about Python a bit.  Maybe we can meet up with the BeerBof afterwards! :)
* `Trac <http://trac.edgewall.org>`_ BoF: Meet in front of La Guardia at 5pm in search of dinner, back for Q&A and hacking in La Guardia at 7pm.
* `Chicago Python User Group <http://chipy.org>`_ Meeting: Thursday night 7 pm. Swing by after you check in!
* `EduPython2008`_ : The annual BoF for discussing Python in Education... or Education in Python... or...
* `PyConRecordingBof`_: the conference will leave us with a large pile of audio and video data to be edited and published.  We need to form a group of volunteer editors to process all this material.
* How to start and maintain a local Python Users Group
* `BuildBoF`: Buildbot users and developers gather together
* `TexasPythoneers`_  Start planning the next Texas Regional Un-Conference in Austin. 
* `Python and Scrum`_ Roundtable discussion regarding the impact of Python in a Scrum shop, and the contrary.  Friday lunch?
* `PackagingBOF`_ : Discussion about packaging and distribution of Python libraries (eggs and distutils).  Friday or Saturday.
