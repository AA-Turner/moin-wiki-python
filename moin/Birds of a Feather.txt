The following birds-of-a-feather sessions are being planned:

* `Zope Foundation <http://foundation.zope.org>`_ members BoF
* `BeerBoF`_: Noble Python programers will set off in search of the Chicago's rare "local micros".  Upon encountering the **beers**, the coders will consume them with great vigor.
* `ClimbBoF`_:  Let's find a local climbing gym to feed our addiction and talk about Python a bit.  Maybe we can meet up with the BeerBof afterwords! :)
* `Trac <http://trac.edgewall.org>`_ BoF: details forthcoming.
* `Chicago Python User Group <http://chipy.org>`_ Meeting: Thursday night 7 pm. Swing by after you check in!
* `EduPython2008`_ : The annual BoF for discussing Python in Education... or Education in Python... or...
* `PyConRecordingBof`_: the conference will leave us with a large pile of audio and video data to be edited and published.  We need to form 

* How to start and maintain a local Python Users Group
* `BuildBoF`: Buildbot users and developers gather together
* Texas Pythoneers!  Start planning the next Texas Regional Un-Conference in Austin. This will be a similar follow-on to last year's successful `gathering in Houston <http://pycamp.python.org/Texas/HomePage>`_.
* `Python and Scrum`_ Roundtable discussion regarding the impact of Python in a Scrum shop, and the contrary.  Friday lunch?
