= planet.python.org setup =

planet.python.org is currently hosted on dinsdale.python.org.
It's running a 2005 version of the software

The set-up is in the /data/planet/ directory.  Templates and the configuration files
are in /data/planet/config/.  Currently the configuration files are:

* config.ini : for planet.python.org
* jython.ini : for planet.jython.org

The Subversion URL for the repository is 
file:///data/repos/systems/dinsdale/data/planet/code/ on dinsdale, or 
svn+ssh://svn.python.org/data/repos/systems/ for remote access.

Currently the live Planet set-up is under my user ID on dinsdale; we should move it to some
generic user ID and put it in some common group. 
There's no commit hook that automatically updates the live files after a checkin; instead I just log into dinsdale, edit config.ini or jython.ini as desired, commit it, and 
wait for the next scheduled update to run.

The sites are updated with the following cron jobs (again, under my user ID): {{{
37 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,21 * * * /data/planet/run.sh /data/planet/config/config.ini
47 1,10,19 * * * /data/planet/run.sh /data/planet/config/jython.ini
}}}
