= Configuration File Version Control =

== Initializing a new machine ==

Here's how to set up the version control on a new system.

1. Initialize the ``/etc`` directory as a Bazaar repository. {{{
bzr init /etc
}}}

2. Make the 'add' and 'status' subcommands ignore all files by default. {{{
bzr ignore '*'
}}}

3. Manually add the files you want to track: {{{
bzr add /etc/network/interfaces
bzr add /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
 ...
}}}

4. Commit for the first time: {{{
cd /etc
bzr commit -m "Record configuration files"
}}}
