The !MoinMoin installation is on dinsdale, and is a stock Debian package.

There are 4 instances:

 * main.py
 * jython.py
 * pycon.py
 * psf.py

Their configuration files are in `/data/moin/instances/`; there's also a `farmconfig.py` containing global settings.

After changing any of the configuration files, you should restart Apache
for the changes to take effect: `apache2ctl graceful`.
This should not cause any visible downtime to endusers.

The configuration files are kept in a mercurial repository, so please commit your changes with `hg commit -u yourname` if you change anything.

!MoinMoin uses WSGI, which is configured to restart after 1000
requests, so any such change will propagate eventually
(typically after about 1h).
