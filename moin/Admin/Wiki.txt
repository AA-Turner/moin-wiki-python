The Moin''''''Moin installation is on ximinez, and is a stock Debian package.

There are 4 instances:

 * main.py
 * jython.py
 * pycon.py
 * psf.py

Their configuration files are in /data/moin/instances/ ; there's also a farmconfig.py
containing global settings.

After changing any of the configuration files, you should restart Apache
for the changes to take effect: `apache2ctl graceful`.
This should not cause any visible downtime to endusers.

Moin''''''Moin uses WSGI, which is configured to restart after 1000
requests, so any such change will propagate eventually
(typically after about 1h).
