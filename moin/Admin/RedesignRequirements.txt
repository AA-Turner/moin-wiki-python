= Goals for 2007 redesign =

 * Rebuilding needs to be faster.
   * Global rebuilds could be very fast.  (But just looping over the entire directory tree, doing no work at all, may take 30 seconds.  This seems infeasible. XXX Verify that time figure.)
   * Or, a fast rebuild of a subtree or page needs to be easy.

 * Must not require a massive restructuring of the current build/data tree.  (We may or may not use nav.yml and the other files, but a new tool mustn't require some enormous transition process.) 
 * Continue supporting reST and hand-written HTML; we'll continue working on killing off the HTML, but don't want to make it dependent on that.
 * Should be possible to include Wiki pages.
 * Easier to build: use the current best-of-practice YAML parser, whatever that may be, etc.

 * Should include a redirect list inside the pydotorg SVN, so that it doesn't require editing the Apache configs to move a page.

 * Should use some 3rd-party Python library for templating, not some custom-invented new syntax.

 * Should be usable as the back-end for generating pages on the fly in case python.org becomes fully dynamic.  So generating a single page should be reasonably quick and not require any expensive operations.
