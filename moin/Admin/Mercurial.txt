= Mercurial setup =

Mercurial services (hg.python.org) are currently hosted on dinsdale.python.org. Everything is under user `hg`'s home directory in `/data/hg`.

Mercurial itself uses a recent stable build, with a couple of custom patches.  The Mercurial tree is in `~hg/mercurial`. The patches are in named branch `local`, which is branched off branch `stable`. This source tree is installed in `~hg/lib/python`, using `make install-home`.

Scripts are in `~hg/bin`, which is versioned using Mercurial:

 * `genauth` regenerates the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file using the current committers' public keys
 * `hg-ssh` is used as a shell for remote logins of user `hg`, in order to restrict them to a few safe commands
 * `gcrepos` detects "stale" repositories in a directory ("stale" meaning having received no new changesets since their creation), so as to enable garbage-collecting of unused server-side clones; this still needs wrapping in a cronjob
 * `hg` itself is the Mercurial executable installed by `make install-home`

Public repos are in `~hg/repos`. They are served using two mechanisms:

 * for the `ssh://...` URLs (which allowing pushing), by the `hg-ssh` script mentioned above
 * for the `http://hg.python.org/...` URLs, using WSGI script `~hg/wsgi/python.wsgi` run by a mod_wsgi instance in daemon mode under user `hg`. This script itself uses configuration file `~hg/repos.conf`.
