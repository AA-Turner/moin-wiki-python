The Tix (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an additional rich set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has many useful widgets, they are far from complete. The Tix library provides most of the commonly needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk. Tix.py is a standard library module, the source
distribution has a set of demos in Demo/tix and it is described in the 
reference manual: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-Tix.html

To take a look at an example of how Tix can improve the look of a Tkinter
application, look at the 'Tixed' version of IDLE called IDEStudio at
