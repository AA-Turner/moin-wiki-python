Topic Suggestions for Zope 2 sprint at Pycon 

   (please add more topics!)

 Bugathon

   Maybe boring but really useful: we haven't had a Bug Day in a loooong time.
   There are well over 1000 active bugs in the Collector. That's ridiculous.
   How many do you think we could stomp out with 2-6 smart Zopatistas in one room?

 Improved Large Blob Support

   Downloading and uploading large binary files to Zope sucks rocks.
   ZEO may exacerbate the issue, I'm not sure. Chris, I know you've worked on 
   this before ... ZC has some code but they tell me it's not 
   production-quality and nobody has time to work on it...
   maybe we could tackle it for this sprint. This would be very useful to my
   employer and would help justify my attending the sprint ;-)

 CMF Core / Default

   There's probably plenty of useful work that could be done on CMF.
   Suggestions?

 Documentation

   There's a number of things that could use attention ...

   The API reference is outdated and hard to maintain:
   it lives in its own little corner of the CVS tree, doesn't use docstrings of 
   actual classes or interfaces, omits lots of useful information, contains at least
   one big lie (ObjectManagerItem), and is hard to synchronize with the online 
   Zope Book API reference. We could create & implement a better plan.

   The Zope Book hasn't been updated in about a year and does not cover 2.7.
   We could spend a day or two editing the book. :-P

   The Developers' Guide could probably use attention... at least,
   integrating the accumulated user comments.

   The Backtalk Book product used for all of the above docs could really benefit from
   a new feature: an auto-generated table of contents within each chapter, showing
   the structure of the chapter. This would really help in the HTML version - some
   of the chapters are really long!
