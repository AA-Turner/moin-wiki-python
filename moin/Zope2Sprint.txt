 Bugathon

   Maybe boring but really useful: we haven't had a Bug Day in a loooong time.
   There are well over 1000 active bugs in the Collector. That's ridiculous.
   How many do you think we could stomp out with 2-6 smart Zopatistas in one room?

 CMF Core / Default

   There's probably plenty of useful work that could be done on CMF.
   Suggestions?
