== Sprints ==
There is room for arranging sprints from Thursday 30 June to Sunday 3 July. By special arrangement, it is possible to have sprints before the conference and sprints that extend beyond  3 July. You can even have sprints in the downstairs cafeteria area during the conference.

If you plan to arrange a sprint, please send a mail to europython@python.org with a description of the sprint as well. We are going to need volunteers to help with some logistical issues. Read more at this URL: http://www.europython.org/sections/sprints_and_wiki/dates_for_sprinting

=== Proposed sprints ===

   * CPS sprint: Nuxeo is willing to setup a CPS sprint for those interested
   * [http://sandbox.rulemaker.net/ngps/m2/ M2Crypto] sprint: HeikkiToivonen would like to run a sprint to fix memory leaks, complete and sanitize the API, write better samples and tests, etc.

== BOF Sessions ==

There are a couple of areas at the conference site that are suitable for BOFs. You can also place a BOF in the Student Union house.

== Leisure ==

There are many fun things you can do in Göteborg before and after the conference, and they get even more fun if you do them together with other conference participants.

 * ArchipellagoTrip
 * MuseumVisit
 * LisebergVisit
 * BeerDrinking
 * DiningOut
 * MusicEvent
 * EastIndia Ship
 * BotanicalGardens
 * SlottsSkogen

== Accomodation ==

Questions, hints and tips about where to stay, and requests for sharing.

'''Question:''' Is it possible to sleep at the university on air mattress and sleeping bag? This would be a nice and cheap alternative for poor students. Furthermore, this could provide a quite nice working atmosphere in the night. Is it possible to get a room for that purpose?

'''Response:''' No, it is strictly forbidden to stay overnight in any location within the university. There are nightguards ensuring that this policy is followed.
