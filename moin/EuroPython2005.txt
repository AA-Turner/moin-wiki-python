== Sprints ==
There is room for arranging sprints from Thursday 30 June to Sunday 3 July. By special arrangement, it is possible to have sprints before the conference and sprints that extend beyond  3 July. You can even have sprints in the downstairs cafeteria area during the conference.

===Proposed sprints===

- CPS sprint: Nuxeo is willing to setup a CPS sprint for those interested

== BOF Sessions ==

There are a couple of areas at the conference site that are suitable for BOFs. You can also place a BOF in the Student Union house.

== Accomodation ==

Questions, hints and tips about where to stay, and requests for sharing.

'''Question:''' Is it possible to sleep at the university on air mattress and sleeping bag? This would be a nice and cheep alternative for poor students. Furthermore, this could provide a quite nice working atmosphere in the night. Is it possible to get a room for that purpose?

'''Response:''' No, it is strictly forbidden to stay overnight in any location within the university. There are nightguards ensuring that this policy is followed.
