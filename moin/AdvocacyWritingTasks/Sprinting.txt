This will be an article demystifying Python Sprints.  We hope to publish it in a major journal in time to contribute to the PyCon 2008 publicity effort and to encourage first-time sprinters to take part.

Interview participants:

CD: Catherine Devlin : never sprinted; inteviewer

BC: Brett Cannon : Python core sprint coach/participant

Possible questions (depending on how the "flow" actually goes:

What is sprinting?

What sort of tasks are accomplished at a sprint?
How do sprints benefit the project?  The community?  The participants?

Where do sprints take place?

What does a sprint in action look like?

What is required of a sprinter?

First-time sprinters, how did you decide to sprint?  Were you nervous about sprinting?  What surprised you about the experience?  How has sprinting effected you as a programmer?  What would you say to others who've never sprinted?
