This will be an article demystifying Python Sprints.  We hope to publish it in a major journal in time to contribute to the PyCon 2008 publicity effort and to encourage first-time sprinters to take part.

Interview participants:

CD: Catherine Devlin : never sprinted; interviewer

BC: Brett Cannon : Python core sprint coach/participant

JB: Jim Baker : Jython sprint co-coach/participant and first-time PyCon sprinter

Begin interview
---------------

*Development sprints gather small groups of people for bursts of face-to-face cooperation to advance software projects.  They're increasing in popularity in the open-source world, but many developers still don't know whether or how they could take part.  We speak with experienced and rookie sprinters to get a better feel for the phenomenon.*

CD: Brett and Jim, can you start by telling us a little about your backgrounds?

Possible questions (depending on how the "flow" actually goes:

What is sprinting?

What sort of tasks are accomplished at a sprint?
How do sprints benefit the project?  The community?  The participants?

Where do sprints take place?

What does a sprint in action look like?

What is required of a sprinter?

First-time sprinters, how did you decide to sprint?  Were you nervous about sprinting?  What surprised you about the experience?  How has sprinting effected you as a programmer?  What would you say to others who've never sprinted?
