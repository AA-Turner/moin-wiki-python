We intend to show that Python is an ideal language to choose for database interaction.  In particular, the Python DBI offers a consistent look and feel when it comes to using just about any database.

[wiki:/BrainStorm Brainstorming] - This is where we can record ideas, try formats, and debate the topics to be covered.  Have an idea to share?  This is where you want to start.

[wiki:/WhitePaperPage Whitepaper] - A short, sweet, and highly impressive argument that Python is the ideal language to use when connecting to any database.

[wiki:/PamphletPage Pamphlet] - This is where we store copy and images for the various pamphlets we may (or may not) create.
