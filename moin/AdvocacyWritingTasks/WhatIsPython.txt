===============================
 Outline for: "What is Python"
===============================

:Abstract:
  The goal of this paper is to present a concise, benefits-based
  explanation of what the Python language is all about, to a reader
  who is already a programmer but not knowledgeable about Python.

  For handing out at mixed-topic conferences and user group meetings,
  where contact with curious people can be made, to make them aware
  that Python even exists. In this environment we can't be sure of
  their background but if they are interested in a programming
  language, we can assume either a basic programming background or
  team/managerial responsibility.

  Include names/logos of your more mainstream companies that are
  using Python, but probably omit the more obscure ones. 

Benefits
========

 * readable
 * very high-level expressibility
 * a feature-rich library
 * cross-platform
 * used in different problem domains
