:Abstract:
  Discuss the resources available to user groups, such as mailing
  lists hosts, free wikis and blogs. Mention that user groups can be
  listed on www.python.org, with python.meetup.com and also Craig's

With a few new local Python user groups getting off the ground, it's
worth reminding ourselves that o'Reilly offer good support to groups
who register with them.

Full details are at http://ug.oreilly.com. You have to register your group (not too onerous) and in return you can get

 - review copies of o'Reilly books
 - discounts on o'Reilly products, a nice benefit for members
 - donations of books, like we were given for the draw at PyCon UK

and, no doubt, a few other things, like I think it's possible to get
o'Reilly authors to speak at meetings.
