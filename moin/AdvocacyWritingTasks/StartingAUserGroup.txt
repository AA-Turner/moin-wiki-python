"When we started our LUG here, we had a lot of thoughts on how to efficiently promote Python and attract people to our meetings.

Having a page that gathers good tips from experienced guys that had done this for years would be valuable imho. They are many topics that can be LUG-oriented as well:

- How to do/organize a sprint
- How to synchronize the LUG work (like doc writing) with PSF needs"
