Love working with Jython in Tomcat. Learn more about it by checking out [http://jywiki.sourceforge.net/index.php?JythonServlet JythonServlet]. I like to use the CubicTemp template along with it for my templating needs. Really nice. Just remember to add a line:

from __future__ import nested_scopes 

and comment the line:

# del okBuiltins['file']
