Love working with Jython in Tomcat. Learn more about it by checking out [http://jywiki.sourceforge.net/index.php?JythonServlet JythonServlet]. I like to use the CubicTemp template along with it for my templating needs. Really nice. The  [attachment:cubictemp.py modified cubictemp.py] is available here. Use this one instead of the original one to  use it with Jython 2.1 You need to first get the original files from the site. Disclaimer: I haven't done intensive testing. It does what I need and I am happy with it. If you have any problem do let me know.

My [attachment:jython.tut.zip JythonTutorial] for those who already understand basic programming! Starts with python and goes on to do jython!
