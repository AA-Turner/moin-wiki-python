 Python is used for developing on-line systems for the floor of the exchange and for the member firm's back offices. It has been  nearly four  years ago since it  was introduced and there are now about ten developers working full time with this language.  Management here were quick to realize  the speed and lower costs of development. Now years down the road they acknowledge its low maintenence costs.  The language is used in the core of  NYSE's first internet project that ever went live. This project  is now one of their biggest services - their biggest internet based service  by a long way. We use pso see ScriptFoundryModules. We try to keep things simple, but   commercial and political pressure from business  management and  ignorant young blood for  java is impossible to oppose.
