= Porting code to Python 3 =

Since Python 3 introduces some incompatibilities, a porting strategy is needed to be able to run code on Python 3, and to have a single codebase that can be made to work under Python 2 and Python 3 using automatic conversion.

There are two separate issues here:

 * [[PortingPythonToPy3k|Porting Python code]]

 * [[PortingExtensionModulesToPy3k|Porting C code (extension modules)]]

When finished, these two documents are meant to be a comprehensive guide to porting and maintaining Python 2/3 code.
They are authored here in the Wiki and will be included in the official Python documentation when in a good shape.

We also have a [[PortingToPy3k/BilingualQuickRef|Quick Reference]] to porting code to run on both python2 and python3.  At some point, this should be folded into the above pages but currently it contains a quick reference for both Python code and extension modules so it needs some restructuring to fit in.

= Porting Coordination =

A few people from various Linux distributions are interested in starting a central point to work on porting to python3.  Starting to organize this here: [[PortingToPy3k/PortingHelpers]]

= Contact =

Help with and discussion of porting is available on the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-porting|python-porting mailing list]].
