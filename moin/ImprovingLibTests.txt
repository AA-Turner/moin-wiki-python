This page documents all tests that should be added (or improved) to enhance the Python distribution's test suite for the standard library. Checking [http://coverage.livinglogic.de/coverage/web/waf.do Coverage] to see if there are any tests that could be improved or are missing would be real help, if they're not already listed here. Also if you just generally think that a unit test needs improving, please add it here with a list of what could be improved. 

If you feel that you would like to work on a test, please write your name in the 'Volunteer' column of the table below, 
alongside the name of the test you wish to work on.

Please try to get all tests in alphabetical order
