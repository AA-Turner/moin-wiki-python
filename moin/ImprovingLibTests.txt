This page documents all tests that should be added (or improved) to enhance the Python distribution's test suite for the standard library. Checking [http://coverage.livinglogic.de/coverage/web/waf.do Coverage] to see if there are any tests that could be improved or are missing would be real help, if they're not already listed here. Also if you just generally think that a unit test needs improving, please add it here with a list of what could be improved. 

Please try to get all tests in alphabetical order
