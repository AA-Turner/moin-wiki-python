I'm arriving at Dulles around 17:00 on Saturday the 19th for the ["PyConDC2005/Sprints"], but I'm not sure whether I'd rather work on a del.icio.us parcel for Chandler (although the ChandlerSprint2005 starts on Monday, I think) or the TwistedSprint, perhaps LivePage in particular.  Really the PyPySprint sounds appealing, but I'm (a) more interested in Jython at the moment (although there doesn't seem to be a JythonSprint) and (b) it looks pretty full and furthermore (c) I'm arriving late in the day, so I'll miss all the introductory tutorial stuff.

Comments are welcome.
