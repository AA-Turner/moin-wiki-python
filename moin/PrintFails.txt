If you try to print a unicode string to console and get a message like this one:
{{{
>>> print u"\u03A9"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "C:\Python24\lib\encodings\cp866.py", line 18, in encode
    return codecs.charmap_encode(input,errors,encoding_map)
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character u'\u1234' in position
 0: character maps to <undefined>
}}}

That means you're using legacy, limited or misconfigured console. If you're just trying to play with unicode at interactive prompt move to a modern unicode-aware console. Most modern Python distributions come with IDLE where you'll be able to print all unicode characters.

===== Standard Microsoft Windows console =====

By default console in Microsoft Windows is able to display 256 characters. Python will automatically detect what characters are supported by this console. If you try to print unprintable character you will get {{{UnicodeEncodeError}}}.

===== Various UNIX consoles =====

There is no standard way to query UNIX console for find out what characters it supports but fortunately there is a way to find out what characters are considered to be printable. Locale category LC_CTYPE defines what characters are printable. To find out its value type at python prompt:
{{{
#!python
>>> import locale
>>> locale.getdefaultlocale()[1]
'utf-8'
}}}

If you got any other value you won't be able to print all unicode characters. As soon as you try to print a unprintable character you will get {{{UnicodeEncodeError}}}. To fix this situation you need to set the environment variable LANG to one of supported by your system unicode locales. To get the full list of locales use command "locale -a", look for locales that end with string ".utf-8". If you have set LANG variable but now instead of {{{UnicodeEncodeError}}} you see garbage on your screen you need to set up your terminal to use font unicode font. Consult terminal manual on how to do it.
