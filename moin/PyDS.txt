== Python Desktop Server ==

The Python Desktop Server is a combined weblog and aggregator much in the Spirit of [http://radio.userland.com Radio Userland], but implemented in 100% Python. It needs a community server like ["PyCS"] or some FTP server (comments and trackback currently only work in conjunction with a community server) to host it's weblog (FTP and local filesystem drivers are only available in 0.6.0, currently in CVS). Alternatively it can be installed on a central host and just use a local Apache to publish the weblog. Main features are integrated cheetah templating, restructured text as alternative entry format, integrated desktop weblog, aggregator, wiki. It can be extended through your own plugins (called tools) and with macros and text nuggets.
