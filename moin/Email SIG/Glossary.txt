Glossary of Terms-of-Art for the Email Package
==============================================

This page is an attempt to standardize on the language we use to describe
concepts relevant to the email module.  It also mentions some terms that
are deprecated as incorrect or ambiguous, and why.

NOTE: this is a proposed draft, not a final document!

idempotent
    *Deprecated*  This term has in the past been used to describe the
    property we now call "invertable".  Idempotent really means you
    can apply a function to an input, and if you apply the function
    again to the output from the first application, you get back the
    same result.  That's not what the email package does.

invertible
    The email package attempts to maintain *invertibility*.  By this we
    mean that if you feed an input into the package, and later ask for
    that data to be serialized back out, you should get out the data you
    put in.  For well-formed input, this is an absolute guarantee, and
    any deviation is a bug.  For other input, we may find it necessary
    to break invertibility.

raw data
    *Deprecated* because its usage has been ambiguous.  In some cases
    it is another term for wire-format, used especially when the data
    is expected to not be RFC compliant.  But it has also been used to
    refer to transfer-decoded bytes, on the theory that the decoded bytes
    are the 'raw data' that went into the transfer-encoding pipeline at
    the originating MTA.

string
    python3 unicode string

text
    unicode text (stored in a python3 string)

transfer-decoded
    Data that has been decoded from wire-format into 8 bit bytes.

transfer-encoded
    Bytes that have been validly encoded per the RFCs for transmission
    "over the wire", ie: to wire-format.

wire-format
    The format that data is in when transmitted "over the wire"; which is
    to say in a binary format rather than unicode, said binary format
    containing the data of the message nominally transfer-encoded.
    Wire-format data may or may not be well formed according the RFCs;
    the term refers to the data actually found in the wild.
