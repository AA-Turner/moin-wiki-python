Glossary of Terms-of-Art for the Email Package
==============================================

This page is an attempt to standardize on the language we use to describe
concepts relevant to the email module.  It also mentions some terms that
are deprecated as incorrect or ambiguous, and why.

NOTE: this is a proposed draft, not a final document!

**charset**
    The term used in the email RFCs for the identifier that specifies
    how to interpret a set of bytes so as to reconstruct the text
    characters of the original content.  'charset' is also the keyword
    used in MIME headers when specifying a charset.  What the RFCs refer
    to as a charset is more generally called a `character encoding`_.
    Python documentation generally shortens this to simply "encoding".
    This unfortunately conflicts with the email RFCs use of the term
    "encoding"; see the "encoding" entry for more.

    The charset identifiers used in (among other things) MIME are listed
    in a `special document`_ on the IANA web site.

**conformant**
    Conforming to a particular specification or standard.  The Internet
    RFCs use this term to refer to implementations and data that
    conform to the requirements of the RFC.

**encoding**
    In Python documentation, this is short for `character encoding`_.
    In the email RFCs, encoding is short for "transfer encoding", and
    refers to the way in which arbitrary bytes are encoded into US-ASCII
    so as to produce an RFC conformant byte stream.  The RFC defined
    encodings are "quoted printable" and "base64".

**idempotent**
    A property of certain operations in computer science and
    mathematics.  An operation is idempotent if multiple applications
    of the operation do not change the result.  Formally, given an
    operation 'g', 'g' is idempontent if and only if:

        g(g(x)) = g(x)

    For example, the 'lowercase' operation is idempotent.  There are
    operations provided by the email package where it makes sense to
    require either strict idempotence, or idempotence when possible.

**invertible**
    The email package attempts to maintain *invertibility*.  By this we
    mean that if you feed an input into the package, and later ask for
    that data to be serialized back out, you should get out the data you
    put in.  For well-formed input, this is an absolute requirement, and
    any deviation is a bug.  For other input, we may find it necessary
    to break invertibility.  Note that invertibility is a stronger
    requirement on an operation than idempotence, but it applies only
    when an inverse operation exists.

**raw data**
    Data in the form it enters the email module parser, or exits the
    email module generator (primarily the former). [*]_  A related term
    is 'wire-format', the difference being that wire-format data is
    understood to be RFC conformant.  Raw data may or may not be RFC
    conformant, and may or may not be bytes (if, for example, it comes
    from a doctest or other text input source).

    .. [*] Note that in the past this term has been used ambiguously to
       also refer to the original source data that was transfer-encoded
       into the form that is the actual raw data that the email module
       deals with.

**string**
    python3 unicode string

**text**
    unicode text (stored in a python3 string)

**transfer-decoded**
    Data that has been decoded from wire-format into 8 bit bytes.

**transfer-encoded**
    Bytes that have been validly encoded per the RFCs for transmission
    "over the wire", ie: to wire-format.  Mostly used in the verb form
    (ex: "after the data has been transfer-encoded") in discussing
    operations involving the RFC defined transfer encodings Quoted
    Printable and BASE64.

**wire-format**
    The format that data is in when transmitted "over the wire"; which is
    to say in a binary format rather than unicode, said binary format
    containing the data of the message transfer-encoded according
    to the RFCs.
