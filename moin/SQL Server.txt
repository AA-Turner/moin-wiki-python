==== Comments ====

== Other Drivers ==

=== ODBC ===

It is possible to connect to an SQL Server database using ODBC, either the mxODBC driver or the one included with Win32all. However, this is not recommended - adodbapi is a better solution, in part because it supports unicode.

== Pros ==

SQL Server is a robust and fully-featured database, and it performs very well. Moreover, I have not had any problems using this database with Python.

== Cons ==

 * Windows only
 * Not free
