= Code =

Welcome to ["JAM"]'s code page.  Here you can find programs that were '''originally''' written by ["JAM"].  I have now made this page Open Source.  Anybody is free to edit these programs.  Please do not vandalize this page.  I hope to soon have .pyc files ready for those who do not like to mess around with source code.  I hope that the programs improve from here on out.

If you make a change to one of the programs in this section of the Wiki, please be sure to tell everybody that you made a change by posting a notice at ["JAM/Code/Changes"].

= Programs =

 * ["JAM/Code/PlatformFinder"] - Shows you what platform you're using.
 * ["JAM/Code/HypotIO"] - An I/O interface for the ''hypot(x, y)'' function of the math module.
 * ["JAM/Code/ComPYiler"] - Compiles every .py file in your Python directory.
