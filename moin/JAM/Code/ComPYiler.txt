= ComPYiler =

This is a program that compiles every .py file in the Python directory.  Please note that it only works if you set Python's directory to C:\Python24.  If you are using an older version or customized your directory choice.  I am not sure what opperating systems it will work on, but I know it will work on win32.

This program is part of the ["Powerful Python One-Liners"] group.  I hope to help expand the ["Code"] page.  Thank you for visiting this page and ''HAVE A GREAT DAY!''':-)
