= HypotIO =

This program creates an I/O interface for the ''hypot(x, y)'' function of the math module.  It is very simple.

= Code =

{{{from math import hypot

print "HypotIO - Programmed by JAM"
print
print "What is the value of x?"
x = float(raw_input())
print
print "What is the value of y?"
y = float(raw_input())
print
print "The value of z is:"
print hypot(x, y)
print
print "Press Enter to quit."
raw_input()}}}
