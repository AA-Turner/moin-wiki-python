This will be a good opportunity to:
  * Learn about Zope 3 development
  * Contribute to Zope 3
  * Meet other Zope 3 developers

The sprint will be held March 19-22.

As far as tasks go, I'm pretty flexible.

If you plan to participate, please put your name below, and, if
you won't be there all 4 days, indicate which days you plan to
be there.

Participants:
 * Jim Fulton
 * Garrett Smith
 * Brian Skahan

If you don't sign up, you can still come and participate.
The sign up is to give us an idea who will be there.
