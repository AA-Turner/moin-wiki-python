We'll have a Zope 3 sprint at PyCon 2004

This will be a good opportunity to:
  * Learn about Zope 3 development
  * Contribute to Zope 3
  * Meet other Zope 3 developers

The tasks and format of the sprint will depend on the
participants.  For example, if any participants haven't
worked on Zope3 before, then I'll provide a tutorial.

Participants:
 * Jim Fulton
 * Erik Dahl
 * Mark Mc''''''Eahern
 * Nathan Yergler
 * Lex Berezhny
 * Sathya Rangaswamy
 * Naveen Parameshwara
 * Stephan Richter
 * MichaelBernstein
