A. Policies and Procedures
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   round of grants (2004/2005).  The budget will be set by the board
   in future years.

2. Grants can go to anybody who submits a proposal for the call below,
   except for committee members.

3. After the deadline, the committee members review the proposals, and
   rank them as a) strong accept b) weak accept c) weak reject d)
   strong reject

4. Proposals that get a single d) vote or only c) votes are rejected.

   reviews, and the highest-ranking proposals are accepted until the
   money is exhausted, or we run out of proposals.

6. The board is asked for approval of the suggested projects.

7. The committee oversees approved projects, and clears payments to

   results.

B. Call for Proposals (2004)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python Software Foundation is seeking grant proposals for projects
related to the further development of Python, Python-related
technology, and educational resources. The PSF plans to issue calls
for proposals regularly.

Proposals should be for specific projects with a clear objective,
rather than support for ongoing activities. Proposals should be brief
(a few pages of text), and they should explain:

a) what the objective of the project is,

b) what precisely the funds are needed for,

c) a delivery plan, indicating what deliverables will be provided at
   what time, and

d) a payment plan, indicating what payments should be made at what
   time.

Awarded grants can range up to $40,000.

Proposals for this call must be submitted before October 1, 2004.
Projects will start on November 1, 2004, and must be completed by
October 30, 2005.
