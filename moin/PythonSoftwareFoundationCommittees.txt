   rank them as a) strong accept b) weak accept c) weak reject d)
   strong reject

4. Proposals that get a single d) vote or only c) votes are rejected.

B. Call for Proposals (2004)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python Software Foundation is seeking grant proposals for projects
related to the further development of Python, Python-related
technology, and educational resources. The PSF plans to issue calls
for proposals regularly.

Proposals should be for specific projects with a clear objective,
rather than support for ongoing activities. Proposals should be brief
(a few pages of text), and they should explain:

a) what the objective of the project is,

b) what precisely the funds are needed for,

c) a delivery plan, indicating what deliverables will be provided at
   what time, and

d) a payment plan, indicating what payments should be made at what
   time.

Awarded grants can range up to $40,000.

Proposals for this call must be submitted before October 1, 2004.
Projects will start on November 1, 2004, and must be completed by
October 30, 2005.
