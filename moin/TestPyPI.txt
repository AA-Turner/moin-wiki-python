= Test PyPI Server =

Just learning the packaging ropes or trying some system integration out?

Why not use our new '''test''' PyPI server at https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

To upload packages to it:
{{{
   python setup.py upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
}}}
To install packages from it:
{{{
    pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi <package name>
}}}
