= Test PyPI Server =
Just learning the packaging ropes or trying some system integration out?

Why not use our new '''test''' PyPI server at https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

To upload packages to it you need to:

1. Register with the site. It has a different user database than the main PyPI server. It also gets cleaned out on a semi-regular basis.

2. Fill in your test PyPI credentials in your ~/.pypirc file. You should end up with something like this:

{{{
[distutils]
index-servers=
    pypi
    pypitest

[pypitest]
repository = https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username = <your user name goes here>
password = <your password goes here>

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = <your user name goes here>
password = <your password goes here>
}}}
3. Use the test server URL to register your project (it gives you the right to modify your project on the server):

{{{
   python setup.py register -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
}}}
4. Then uploading it:

{{{
   python setup.py upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
}}}
Now that your project is on the server, test that you can install your package from testpypi (it may be a good idea to run your unit tests from another directory to make sure you are using the version you just installed):

{{{
    pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi <package name>
}}}
If you need to push your project again, change the version number in `setup.py` otherwise the server will give you an error.
