= Test PyPI Server =

Just learning the packaging ropes or trying some system integration out?

Why not use our new '''test''' PyPI server at https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

To upload packages to it you need to:

1. Register with the site. It has a different user database than the main PyPI server. It also gets cleaned out on a semi-regular basis.

2. Fill in your test PyPI credentials in your ~/.pypirc file. You should end up with something like this:

{{{
[distutils]
index-servers=
    pypi
    test

[test]
repository = https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username = richard
password = <your password goes here>

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = richard
password = <your password goes here>
}}}

3. Then use the test server URL when uploading or installing packages:

{{{
   python setup.py upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
}}}
To install packages from it:
{{{
    pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi <package name>
}}}
