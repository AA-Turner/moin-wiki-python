EMACS and vi are used to be the most popular families of text editors.
There are several implementations for each.

The user interface of EMACS is mostly modeless.  The user interface of
vi traditionally has a '''command mode''' and an '''insert mode'''.  Each
character has different meanings depending on in which mode '''vi''' is in.
Commands in EMACS are traditionally given by modifier keys like {{{Ctrl}}},
{{{Alt}}} and so on.

At earlier times EMACS became ''famous'' about his size and memory consumption
(EMACS = Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping ;) ).  With todays computers this
is no longer a problem.  EMACS contains a Lisp interpreter, which makes it 
very extensible.  

Modern implementations of vi are also extensible.  For example vim http://www.vim.org
is extensible with Python scripts.

Which editor suits your personal needs better is a matter of taste.
Since both are OpenSource, free and mature, try both and choose one. :)
