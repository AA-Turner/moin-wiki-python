PyIMSL is a collection of Python wrappers to the mathematical and statistical algorithms in the [[http://www.vni.com/products/imsl/c/imslc.php|IMSL C Numerical Library]]. PyIMSL is available as part of the [[http://www.vni.com/pyimslstudio|PyIMSL Studio]] product or as a separate download. If using PyIMSL as a separate download, a IMSL C Numerical Library license is required.

PyIMSL is unique in that developers get 100% consistency between the mathematical and statistical algorithms used for prototyping as used for production. Developers can use Python and PyIMSL for rapid prototyping. Using IMSL C Library in a production C application, developers can get the the same mathematics and statistics algorithms in both development environments.

PyIMSL is available at no charge to current IMSL C Numerical Library customers or is available with [[http://www.vni.com/pyimslstudio|PyIMSL Studio]].
