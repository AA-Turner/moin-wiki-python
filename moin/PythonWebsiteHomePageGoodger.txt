=====================================================
 David Goodger's Python.org Home Page Candidate Plan
=====================================================

Home Page
=========

I think the home page should contain as little **static** text as
possible, and should be as small as possible.  The "News and
Announcements" section should be visible without scrolling.

Remove all current subheads from "Python for the web... and data" to
"Python is friendly... and easy to learn" inclusive (put these on
secondary pages, on the ABOUT page, or under 
"Applications" section & "About -> Benefits").

Change the page title to "Python Programming Language -- Official
Website".  With "The Official Python Programming Language Website",
the all-important word "Python" disappears too quickly from browser
tabs.

Left sidebar:

* navigation menu
* Quick links (*not* "quicklinks").  "Cheese Shop" is confusing to
  those not in the know; perhaps "Cheese Shop (Python Projects)" or
  "Python Projects ('Cheese Shop')"?

Center:

* One-paragraph intro, but remove the "What is Python?" header
* Add a prominent "More About Python" link after the paragraph.
* Under "Try Python Today!" header: prominent Download, Get Started,
  Documentation links/buttons/icons
* News & Announcements

Right sidebar:

* A Quote (static? randomly changed? manually changed? how often?)
* Success Story excerpt or photo, with a "continued..." link
* "Using Python For..."
* "Written in Python"


Navigation Menu
===============

* "FOUNDATION" (was "PSF")

   * move higher up the menu, to the second item, between "About" & "News"
   * change to "Python Software Foundation", even if it wraps (AMK
     changed "PSF" to "FOUNDATION", which is better, but still not
     clear IMO; could be confused with "foundation classes" etc.)
   * bug: when I click the FOUNDATION link, the "Community" submenu opens up
   * add a sub-menu

* Change "Python-dev" to "Developers"

* Add "Applications" section (see below)


ABOUT section
=============

Change order:

* Getting Started
* Benefits (new page; see http://www.squidoo.com/pythonology/)
* Success Stories
* Quotes
* Website
* Help


APPLICATIONS section
====================

One item & page per major application area (i.e. "Using Python For..."
items from the home page)
