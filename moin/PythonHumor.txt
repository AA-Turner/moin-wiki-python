So! There's a /doc/humor page at http://www.python.org/doc/humor/ that tells you to put suggestions for additions on a wiki page that does not exist (wiki.python.org/PythonHumor is where it links to).

Since that doesn't exist, I've created this page to suggest my all-time favorite CLP posting for inclusion: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/7613422265cdc010 .
