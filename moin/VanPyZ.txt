=== Python 3000 ===

Brett Cannon: September 4, 2007

Under development in the mind of Guido for years, Python 3.0 is finally becoming a reality with a planned alpha in August. While great strides are being taken to not change the feel of the language, Python 3.0 does break backwards-compatibility and introduce many new features to the language (while removing other features to make room for the new one). This talk will be a basic overview of what Python 3.0 is trying to accomplish and how it is accomplishing it.

Brett is working towards his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of British Columbia while being one of the core developers of Python.

=== Stock trading with Python ===

April 3, 2007

An Automated Trading System (ATS) is used to find profitable trading strategies and electronically execute these strategies across in realtime.

We examine how the ATS retrieves data using TCP/IP sockets and stores large datasets in a HDF5 database. The trading platform uses this data to backtest trading strategies and manage executions across hundreds of stocks. Finally, we review how electronic stock trades can be made using a broker API... all using Python.
