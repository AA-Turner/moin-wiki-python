== Comments ==

Another set of annotatable documentation is at http://pydoc.amk.ca/frame.html .

That site wraps a frameset around the Python 2.3.4 documentation and adds some JavaScript that updates another frame to display a Wiki page for the documentation page you're viewing.

Please go and add any commentary, links, or other material you wish.   If it becomes clear that people will actually use these annotated docs, they'll probably get moved onto python.org.

I've checked out Andrew's setup.  It's brilliant!  I've been looking at a system for parsing the current CVS documentation, creating wiki pages out of it, and updating them as the docs are changed.  Meanwhile, Andrew has come up with a scheme to view the standard HTML pages side-by-side with comments.

Since that's so functional, and these docs are obsolete already, I'll probably stop work on this version until I think of something better.  Err, make that "if".

Thanks Andrew!
