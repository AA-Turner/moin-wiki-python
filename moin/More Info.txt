      So far, I only have 5 lectures posted. The first and second lecture is not recorded yet. They are about the history of python as well as where you can download them. The beginner's series will be about 50 lectures covering the most basic programming ideas. (loops, if/else, functions, files) as well as some fun Tkinter widget manipulation.

      I am currently looking for volunteers that are willing to teach more advance python lectures. The more advance topics will inclue swig, jython, XML manipulation, etc. If you are interested in volunteering, you can reach me at my ourmedia.org site. [WWW] http://ourmedia.org/user/4887


You don't need any expansive video equipment to record yourself. If you are using linux, the voice is recorded in Audacity, the screen capture is done in gvidcap, and the movie divx format is done is avidmux2. They are all open source and free to download at http://www.sourceforge.net
