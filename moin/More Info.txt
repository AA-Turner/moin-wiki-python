       You don't need any expansive video equipment to record yourself. If you are using linux, the voice is recorded in Audacity, the screen capture is done in gvidcap, and the movie divx format is done is avidmux2. They are all open source and free to download at http://www.sourceforge.net

    


I refuse to take any donations, but if you must please donate to theis charity effort

       This organization helps kids that have been abused and ran away. Everyday more and more children end up homeless. They were not given a fair chance in life as we have. This organization take in the homeless and give them a second chance.
