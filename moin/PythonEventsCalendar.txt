= Python Events Calendar =

The ''Python events calendar'' is a combination of Google calendars maintained by the Python Calendar Team and published on the following sites:

 * http://www.python.org/ (in the events box on the front page and on the [[https://www.python.org/events/|events calendar]] pages)
 * http://www.pycon.org/ (calendar widget under the conference listing)
 * https://twitter.com/PythonEvents (@PythonEvents)
 * http://legacy.python.org/ (in the side bar on the left of all pages)

The events are also listed on a map mashup created by Luis Miguel Morillas:

 * http://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/

Here's a snapshot showing all events from Jan 2012 - April 2015:

== Submitting an Event ==

If you would like to get new events listed on these calendars, please write to events@python.org mentioning:

 * the name of the event (including the user group name for user group events)
 * type of event (conference, bar camp, sprint, user group meeting, etc.)
 * focus on Python and approximate size (number of attendees)
 * the location (venue address, including city and ''country'')
 * the dates/times (including the time zone)
 * a URL with more details for the event (using the format "{{{<a href="http://url/">name of the event</a>}}}")

For recurring events, please also include the recurrence information.

''EMail template:'' {{{
Please add the following event:

 * name of the event: 
 * type of event: 
 * focus on Python: 
 * approximate number of attendees: 
 * location (incl. country): 
 * dates/times/recurrence (incl. time zone): 
 * URL: <a href="http://url/">name of the event</a>
}}}

For ''trainings, courses and similar type of events'', please post your event on the PythonTraining page. We currently do not have a calendar for these.

/!\ Please leave ''at least a week notice'' when submitting events. The calendar team is volunteer driven. While we try to add new events swiftly, we cannot guarantee response times.

== RSS Feeds ==

''Note: Google has [[https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285065?p=xml_deprecation&rd=1|switched off calendar RSS feeds]] on Nov 18 2015, so these links no longer work.''

== Twitter Feed ==

 * [[https://twitter.com/PythonEvents|@PythonEvents]]

 This Twitter account automatically gets all new entries from both calendars as tweets. The triggering is setup using [[https://ifttt.com/|IFTTT]]. Note that changes to the calendar entries are not reported on the Twitter feed. This appears to be a limitation of the IFTTT trigger.

== Embedding Calendars ==

If you'd like to embed the calendar into your site, please ping us at events@python.org before doing so. We'd like to keep a list of sites where the calendars are displayed.

You can find the embedding code further below on this page.

=== Mailing List ===

The team uses the python-events mailing list for discussion and to process events. The events@python.org address is an alias for the python-events mailing list.

=== Guidelines for entries ===

In order to make the decision of whether to add an event and where to add it easier, we've setup a few guidelines:

==== General Requirements ====

 * Events have to have some focus on Python: The event should either target Python, a project written in Python, or showcase Python in some form.
 Examples are Python conferences, conferences which have a Python track or tutorial, conferences at which Python is presented in some form. The same goes for conferences which target a project written mostly in Python (e.g. Plone, Django, [[OpenStack|OpenStack]], etc.) and for other events such as sprints.

 * The calendars should only list the events themselves. CFP deadlines, registration openings or similar announcements should not be listed in the calendars.

==== Calendar Choice ====

 * Python Events Calendar: This calendar should only receive entries for conferences of at least around 100 attendees, which at least around a 3rd non-local attendees. Smaller events with at least around 30 attendees such as sprints, barcamps, PyDays or smaller unconferences may also be added to this calendar if they are scheduled as separate event, will have a significant impact and reach out to larger regions.
 Examples: [[PyCon|PyCon]] conferences, OSCON, Django conferences, Plone conference, Need-for-speed sprints, Python BarCamps/Unconferences/etc.

 * Python User Group Calendar: This calendar is meant for user group activities which are open to Python people from outside the group (new prospective members and visitors from out of town). It is not meant for user group internal events.
 Examples: monthly local user group meetings, project sprints that are open for non-group members, workshops organized by user groups, Django Girls events.

==== Notes regarding calendar entries ====

Some notes regarding entries for the admins:

 * Please add the conference/event year to the title, if available. For user group meetings or other events that occur more often that's probably not necessary.

 * For conferences please use "All day" events, for user group events please add the start time and end time, if known. Full day user group events can also be added as "All day" event to give them a little more attention in the calendar.

 * Please include the location as "City, Country".

 * Please add a link to the event as description. We found that using HTML links works well, e.g. {{{<a href="http://www.pycon.fr/2012/>PyCon FR 2012</a>}}}

 * Please don't add more than the link to the description. If an event does not have a website, it's fine to add a one line text description. Background: The entries should not be used as advertisement text for events, only as reference.

 * Please don't select an event color. People who subscribe to the calendars will have their own color preferences, so it's better to leave the default color set for all events.

 * Reminders should not be setup for the events. They can be annoying for users subscribing to the calendars.

 * We've always used "Show me as: Available" for new entries. No idea whether that matters or not.

 * Please select "Privacy: Default" for new entries. This makes the entries public, since that's the default setting.

All calendar admins can invite more people as calendar admins. When doing so, please add the new admins to the above list and ping the team by writing to events@python.org (also to get their email address added to the python-events mailing list).
