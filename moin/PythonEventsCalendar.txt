The Python events calendar is a group of Google calendars maintained by volunteers and published on the following sites:

 * http://pycon.org/
 * http://python.org/ (in the side bar on the left of all pages)

== Submitting an Event ==

If you would like to get new events listed on these calendars, please write to events@python.org mentioning:

 * the name of the event (including the user group name for user group events),
 * the location (including country),
 * the dates/times (including the time zone) and
 * a URL.

For recurring events, please also include the recurrence information.

/!\ Please leave ''at least a week notice'' when submitting events. The calendar team is volunteer driven. While we try to add new events swiftly, we cannot guarantee response times.

== Embedding Calendars ==

If you'd like to embed the calendar into your site, please ping us at events@python.org before doing so. We'd like to keep a list of sites where the calendars are displayed.

You can find the embedding code further below on this page.

=== Known sites embedding the calendars ===

 * http://python.org/ - in the side bar of the site
 * http://pycon.org/ - on the front page
 * http://dehradunpython.com/

== Administration ==

The following people currently have admin rights to the calendars:

 * Richard Jones
 * Mike Müller
 * Tarek Ziade
 * Tetsuya Morimoto
 * Skip Montanaro
 * Marc-Andre Lemburg

=== Mailing List ===

The team uses the python-events mailing list for discussion and to process events. The events@python.org address is an alias for the python-events mailing list.

 * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-events

=== Notes regarding calendar entries ===

Some notes regarding entries for the admins:

 * Please add the conference/event year to the title, if available. For user group meetings or other events that occur more often that's probably not necessary.

 * For conferences I use "All day" events, for user group events I add the start time and end time, if known.

 * Please include the location as "City, Country".

 * Please add a link to the event as description. I found that using HTML links works well, e.g. {{{<a href="http://www.pycon.fr/2012/>PyCon FR 2012</a>}}}

 * I've always used "Show me as: Available" for new entries. No idea whether that matters or not.

 * Please select "Privacy: Default" for new entries. This makes the entries public, since that's the default setting.

All calendar admins can invite more people as calendar admins. When doing so, please add the new admins to the above list and ping the team by writing to events@python.org (also to get their email address added to the python-events mailing list).

=== Guidelines for entries ===

In order to make the decision of whether to add an event and where to add it easier, we've setup a few guidelines:

==== General Requirements ====

 * Events have to have some focus on Python: The event should either target Python, a project written in Python, or showcase Python in some form.
 Examples are Python conferences, conferences which have a Python track or tutorial, conferences at which Python is presented in some form. The same goes for conferences which target a project written mostly in Python (e.g. Plone, Django, [[OpenStack|OpenStack]], etc.) and for other events such as sprints.

 * The calendars should only list the events themselves. CFP deadlines, registration openings or similar announcements should not be listed in the calendars.

==== Calendar Choice ====

 * Python Events Calendar: This calendar should only receive entries for conferences of at least around 100 attendees, which at least around a 3rd non-local attendees. Smaller events with at least around 30 attendees such as sprints, barcamps or smaller unconferences may also be added to this calendar if they are scheduled as separate event, will have a significant impact and reach out to larger regions.
 Examples: [[PyCon|PyCon]] conferences, OSCON, Django conferences, Plone conference, Need-for-speed sprints, Python BarCamps/Unconferences/etc.

 * Python User Group Calendar: This calendar is meant for user group activities which are open to Python people from outside the group (new prospective members and visitors from out of town). It is not meant for user group internal events.
 Examples: monthly local user group meetings, project sprints that are open for non-group members.
