The Chandler Sprint is a good chance to learn about Chandler and meet people working on the project.

There will be a presentation during the conference  on how to write a Chandler parcel, and during the Sprint, we will probably be working on a number of simple parcels.  We'll update this page with some additional parcel ideas, please feel free to add your own ideas for ""simple"" parcels.
