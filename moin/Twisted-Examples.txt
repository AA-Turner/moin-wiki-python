  * Twisted is an open source network framework written entirely in Python. It allows you to create a SMTP, HTTP, proxy and ssh servers in python with minimal effort.  It is Asynchronous and event driven and allows applications to respond to different network connection without the use of traditional threading models.

  * Be Sure to Download the [http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/ Twisted Sumo 2.1] (main Twisted package),[http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/                 PyOpenSSL ], and [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html PyCrypto] (cryptographic libraries and primitives for ssh connections) before running these Python Twisted examples.

  * Install the ZopeInterface that is bundled with the Twisted Sumo download before installing Twisted. (cd ZopeInterface* && python setup.py install)

  * Install Twisted. (python setup.py install)

  * Install PyOpenSSL. (make sure you have base [http://www.openssl.org openssl] installed on the system) If during the PyOpenSSL install, you see any errors about Kerberos header files, try this:

If your OpenSSL header files are not in /usr/include, you may need to supply
the -I flag to let the setup script know where to look. The same goes for the libraries of course, use the -L flag. Note that build won't accept these
flags, so you have t o run first build_ext and then build! Example:
 
    python setup.py build_ext -I/usr/kerberos/include (or wherever your header files are)

    python setup.py build

    python setup.py install
    

  * Install PyCrypto (python setup.py install)
  * Verify that all the package are installed correctly by importing pyOpenSSL-0.7, twisted,  Crypto from a python shell and we are ready to go.

== Simple HTTP Proxy Server (proxy.py) ==
{{{
from twisted.web import proxy, http
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.python import log
import sys
log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
 
class ProxyFactory(http.HTTPFactory):
        protocol = proxy.Proxy
 
reactor.listenTCP(8080, ProxyFactory())
reactor.run()
}}}

  * Execute the above Twisted python example script (python proxy.py)

  * Connect your internet browser to the proxy server you just created (localhost:8080) and you have written a simple proxy server using Python and Twisted.
