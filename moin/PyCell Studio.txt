PyCell Studio is a complete, stand-alone environment for creating universal OpenAccess PCells and layout generators. PyCells operate within any OpenAccess tool, including Cadence Virtuoso, Silicon Canvas Laker, and Mentor Calibre.

PyCells are authored using Python and the Ciranova Layout API, accessed as a Python extension package. 

PyCell Studio is available for free download (after registration) at the Ciranova web site: http://www.synopsys.com/Tools/Implementation/CustomImplementation/Pages/pycell-studio.aspx
