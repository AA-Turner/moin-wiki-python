= What is PyTables? =

[http://www.pytables.org PyTables] is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed to efficiently and easily cope with extremely large amounts of data.

[http://www.pytables.org PyTables] is built on top of the [http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/ HDF5] library, using the Python language and the [http://numpy.scipy.org/ NumPy] package. It features an object-oriented interface that, combined with C extensions for the performance-critical parts of the code (generated using [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex]), makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool for interactively dealing with, processing and searching very large amounts of data. One important feature of [http://www.pytables.org PyTables] is that it optimizes memory and disk resources so that data takes much less space (specially if on-flight compression is used) than other solutions such as relational or object oriented databases.

= Design goals =
!PyTables has been designed to fulfill the next requirements:

   1. Allow to structure your data in a '''hierarchical''' way.
   2. '''Easy to use'''. It implements the '''natural naming''' scheme for allowing convenient access to the data.
   3. All the '''cells''' in datasets can be '''multidimensional''' entities.
   4. Most of the '''I/O operations speed''' should be '''only limited by the underlying I/O subsystem'''.
   5. Enable the end user to save large datasets in a efficient way, i.e. '''each single byte''' of data on disk has to be '''represented by one byte plus a small fraction''' when loaded in memory.
