= Running scripts from Xcode =
 
It's not terribly difficult to tell Xcode to launch a Python process and start your script. Create a custom executable, point it at Python, and set the arguments and environment variables appropriately. Detailed instructions are here:

= User Scripts =
 * attachment:StartupScript - A Python replacement for the Apple-provided example written in Perl. Install at {{{~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/}}}
 * attachment:50-un_commentLines.py - A Python version of the Apple-provided "Un-Comment" script to be Python-aware. (You'll need to remove the shortcut in the first comment script.) Install at {{{~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Scripts/10-User Scripts/30-Comments}}}. [1/1/5] Fixed error with perl scripts, and added support for commenting applescripts.
 
= Xcode Plug-Ins =
 * [http://undefined.org/python/XOgre-0.0.tgz XOgre-0.0.tgz] - A quick hack to replace Xcode's Find menu with [http://www-gauge.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sonobe/OgreKit/ OgreKit]'s (regular expression engine). Put the pbplugin at {{{~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Plug-Ins}}}.
 * [http://undefined.org/python/XPython-0.0.tgz XPython-0.0.tgz] ([http://undefined.org/python/XPython-bin-0.0.tgz XPython-bin-0.0.tgz] for built Plug-In and two examples) - I put Python in Xcode! Unpack the built version at {{{~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/}}}. Check this out: [[BR]]

And even scarier.. here's the ["/PyObjC"] class browser demo INSIDE Xcode. Just look at all those proprietary Apple classes: [[BR]]

= Notes =
 * The User Scripts feature is totally "borrowed" from [http://www.lorax.com/FreeStuff/TextExtras.html TextExtras]! Look at {{{/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsInterface.framework/Versions/A/Resources/UtilityScripts}}} -- it's *the same*.
