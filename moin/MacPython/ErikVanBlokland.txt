= Hello =

Erik Van Blokland is a Dutch type designer. Started the ../LettError virtual
type foundry with ../JustVanRossum, with whom he worked at
[http://www.metadesign.com/ Meta Design]. Have a look at http://www.letterror.com for some of their
exploits.

Fame came with the release of
Beowolf (co-designed with ../JustVanRossum), a font whose ragged edges shift
randomly each time you print the font. Another font of his, Kosmik, has a
version that flips between three alternates for each character for a more
friendly, hand-drawn feel. Most of his fonts are published by
[http://www.fontfont.com/ FontFont]. He is a key developer on the ../RoboFog
project with ../JustVanRossum and ../PetrVanBlokland.
