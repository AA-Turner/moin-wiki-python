Find It! Keep It! - http://www.ansemond.com <<BR>>
<<BR>>
Save webpages including some kinds of video to a local database with Find It! Keep It!  Find the pages later by browsing your archive, or searching with tags and/or words.<<BR>>
<<BR>>
Find It! Keep It!'s UI is written in /PyObjc but it also uses custom C extensions. Python's interactive command line made understanding Cocoa easier and sped up prototyping. Exceptions improved reliability, but segfaults in Cocoa called from Python were very hard to debug. Being able to constrain functions types and faster execution would be have been handy.

!FontLab - http://www.fontlab.com/ <<BR>>
<<BR>>
"The World's Most Powerful Font Editor - A full featured digital typeface editor".  The Python macro language is a really powerful tool that can save you loads of time in performing tedious tasks. Need to add a bevel to all the characters in your font? A Python macro can do it in a flash. Want to rename all your fonts to add your foundry intials? Do the whole library in seconds with a macro. Got an idea for a new /FontLab tool? Write it in Python and add it to the /FontLab menus. <<BR>>
<<BR>>
Note:  In order to use FontLab's Python support in Mac OS X, you must use a CFM version of Python.  /FontLab has not been compiled as a Mach-O binary for OS X and is therefore not compatible with the normal OS X version of Python.  The version of Python you must install for /FontLab interoperability is called [[/MacPython-OS9]].  Don't worry, it does run natively on OS X.  To download: http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html - the installer will be named something like: MacPython2.3full.bin.  With the release of Python 2.3, MacPython was split two ways:  MacPython-OSX (commonly referred to as just MacPython) and MacPython-OS9.  MacPython-OS9 is a fully Carbonized CFM application that is compatible with CFM applications on both OS 9 (All OS 9 applications are CFM) and OS X (OS X supports both CFM and Mach-O).  MacPython-OSX is a Mach-O application exclusively for OS X.
