[wiki:MacPython/DrawBot DrawBot] - http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/DrawBot [[BR]]
Author: JustVanRossum [[BR]]
[[BR]]
DrawBot is a simple application for MacOSX that allows you to write simple Python scripts that generate two-dimensional graphics. The builtin graphics primitives are currently pretty braindead, it currently only supports rectangles, ovals and (bezier) paths and polygons. A future version will also support text and images.  Note that /DrawBot can export PDF to files and clipboard, so you can bring your /DrawBot creations right into applications such as Adobe® Illustrator® as vectors!

Golly (http://golly.sourceforge.net) is an open source,
cross-platform application for exploring Conway's Game of Life and
other cellular automata.  The GUI is written in wxWidgets (C++, not

Author: DinuGherman [[BR]]
[[BR]]
RegexPlor is a tool for interactively exploring regular expressions.  It provides a graphic frontend for experimenting with such regular  expressions in a intuitive way. You can edit an input text as well  as a regular expression as well as colors for matched text, etc.  and study various effects at every keystroke. This is a much more  convenient way of hunting down the one expression you're after,  without typing any code at all in the usual trial-and-error method.

Author: DinuGherman [[BR]]
[[BR]]
["/ReSTedit"] is a GUI tool for editing and interactivly exploring texts  in the /ReStructuredText format (or ReST) as introduced by the  Docutils project. Despite being very simple ReSTedit is very useful for quickly checking if Docutils renders some text as you would expect it. You only paste it into a ReSTedit window to see if it's ok or not, without writing any test code around it. See a sample movie.

TomatoTorrent - http://sarwat.net/bittorrent/ [[BR]]
Author: SarwatKhan (based on the original BitTorrent, by BramCohen). [[BR]]
[[BR]]
The main goal of this project was to separate the /BitTorrent code from the Macintosh code, so that either can be updated without having to modify the other.  It supports torrent generation from the user interface, remembers recent downloads, shows detailed statistics and torrent information, can launch a torrent tracker, supports unicode, etc.

Transana (http://www.transana.org) is software for professional researchers who want to analyze digital video or audio data. Transana lets you analyze and manage your data in very sophisticated ways. Transcribe it, identify analytically interesting clips, assign keywords to clips, arrange and rearrange clips, create complex collections of interrelated clips, explore relationships between applied keywords, and share your analysis with colleagues. The result is a new way to focus on your data, and a new way to manage large collections of video and audio files and clips. Transana is written with wxPython and developed by David Woods.

Find It! Keep It! - http://www.ansemond.com [[BR]]
[[BR]]
Save webpages including some kinds of video to a local database with Find It! Keep It!  Find the pages later by browsing your archive, or searching with tags and/or words.[[BR]]
[[BR]]
Find It! Keep It!'s UI is written in /PyObjc but it also uses custom C extensions. Python's interactive command line made understanding Cocoa easier and sped up prototyping. Exceptions improved reliability, but segfaults in Cocoa called from Python were very hard to debug. Being able to constrain functions types and faster execution would be have been handy.

FontLab - http://www.fontlab.com/ [[BR]]
[[BR]]
"The World's Most Powerful Font Editor - A full featured digital typeface editor".  The Python macro language is a really powerful tool that can save you loads of time in performing tedious tasks. Need to add a bevel to all the characters in your font? A Python macro can do it in a flash. Want to rename all your fonts to add your foundry intials? Do the whole library in seconds with a macro. Got an idea for a new /FontLab tool? Write it in Python and add it to the /FontLab menus. [[BR]]
[[BR]]
Note:  In order to use FontLab's Python support in Mac OS X, you must use a CFM version of Python.  /FontLab has not been compiled as a Mach-O binary for OS X and is therefore not compatible with the normal OS X version of Python.  The version of Python you must install for /FontLab interoperability is called ["/MacPython-OS9"].  Don't worry, it does run natively on OS X.  To download: http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html - the installer will be named something like: MacPython2.3full.bin.  With the release of Python 2.3, MacPython was split two ways:  MacPython-OSX (commonly referred to as just MacPython) and MacPython-OS9.  MacPython-OS9 is a fully Carbonized CFM application that is compatible with CFM applications on both OS 9 (All OS 9 applications are CFM) and OS X (OS X supports both CFM and Mach-O).  MacPython-OSX is a Mach-O application exclusively for OS X.
