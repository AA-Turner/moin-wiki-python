I'm lucky enough to spend a fair amount of my time at work coding in Python, as well as the majority of my home/hobby time.  I'm working on a game with my seven-year-old daughter using ../PyGame and I participate in the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig Edu-Sig] mailing list.  Currently I'm exploring the use of ["../PyObjC"] to wrap some of the work I'm doing on [http://www.svgopen.org/2003/papers/SVGAndCollaborativeWeb/ data-level collaboration].  I've been working extensively with XML since it was called SGML-Web and with Python for the past several years.

Non-work projects I've been working on, most of which will be using ["../PyObjC"] and/or PyGame:

 * Quick-fix to [Pathological] so multiple logins share high-scores.  My kids really love this game (so do I)
 * Game framework in ../PyGame to make it easier and faster to develop games, including:
   * FayRay, a map-based fairy game with my 7 year-old daughter contributing graphics and game design
   * BoggleTrainer, a port of Boggle which "solves" puzzle, makes spelling suggestions, and looks up definitions of words, gives hints, etc. to help with kids' spelling and vocabulary
   * GoMoku, playable now, needs some tweaks
   * Kutia, a Logo-like turtle-graphics tool to explain programming
   * Quipu, a hex-based path game
 * ["../PyObjC"] clone of [http://www.curvedspace.org/software/oblique.html Oblique Strategies] so I can add my other quotes and also to learn ["PyObjC"]
 * Port [VPython] to OS X natively (not using X Windows)
 * I contribute occasionally to ["../ReStructuredText"]
 * VPython explorations to visual geometry for kids (fun for grownups too)
 * Command-line access to OS X's VTwin search engine

If anyone is interested in seeing these, let me know and I'll make them public sooner.
