Does anyone know how to add a track to a playlist using appscript?

Maybe something like this:

def add to playlist(a, t, pl ):
	a.duplicate( t, to=pl )

Find a connected ipod making no assumptions about the name of the ipod:
------------
from appscript import *

def find_ipod( a ):
	for src in a.sources.get():
		if src.kind.get() == k.iPod:
			return src

ipod = find_ipod( app('Itunes') )
----------

Find the library making no assumptions about the name of the library (e.g. for non-english versions of itunes it's not "Library"):
----------------
from appscript import *

def find_library( a ):
	for src in a.sources.get():
		if src.kind.get() == k.library:
			return src

library = find_library( app('Itunes') )
------------------

Create a new playlist on a certain source (i.e. either the library or an ipod, as returned from one of the functions above).
------------------
src.make( new=k.user_playlist, with_properties={k.name: 'My new playlist'} )
-----------------
