VPython is a very easy to use, "pythonic" way to create interactive 3D applications.  It was developed primarily for use in physics simulations, but I have used it to demonstrate various geometric shapes and properties to my kids, and to demonstrate the bookshelf I wanted to build for my wife. --DetheElza
