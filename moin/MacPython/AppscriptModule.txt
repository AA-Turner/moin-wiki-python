= What is Appscript? =
 
Appscript is a high-level, user-friendly MacPython-to-Apple Event Manager bridge that allows you to control scriptable Mac OS X applications using ordinary Python scripts. Appscript makes MacPython a serious alternative to Apple's own /AppleScript language for automating your Mac.
 
For example, to get the value of the first paragraph of the topmost document in TextEdit: {{{
app('TextEdit').documents[1].paragraphs[1].get()
}}}
 
This is equivalent to the /AppleScript statement: {{{
get paragraph 1 of document 1 of application "TextEdit"
}}}
 
Appscript builds upon lower-level Python packages (aem, osaterminology) to provide:
 1. an Apple event-based ''RPC mechanism'' for sending commands to applications
 1. a mechanism for converting data between common Python and Apple event types
 1. a simple ''embedded query language'' for constructing references to an application's object model
 1. a mechanism that uses application-defined terminology to present these references in human-readable form
 1. an integrated help system for exploring application terminology information
 1. a clean, ''object oriented-like syntax'' for ease of use.
