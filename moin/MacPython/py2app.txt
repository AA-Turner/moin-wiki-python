== 2010-07 ==

=== Problems ===

* for 64-bit systems, the pypi package (0.4.2) failed.
  even with macholib, altgraph and modulegraph gathered from all around.
* here is some workaround http://hg.hardcoded.net/py2app, 
  that i have not tested, as macholib is missing

=== current state ===

* http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk
* http://svn.pythonmac.org/macholib/macholib/trunk
* http://svn.pythonmac.org/altgraph/altgraph/trunk
* http://svn.pythonmac.org/modulegraph/modulegraph/trunk

checkout and install. install with "python setup.py install"
