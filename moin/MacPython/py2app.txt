py2app is a Python setuptools command which will allow you to make standalone application bundles and plugins from Python scripts. py2app is similar in purpose and design to py2exe for Windows.

Latest Version 0.5.2

== Installation ==

(py2app version 0.5 2010-07-28 Ronald Oussuroren)

"easy_install-X.Y -U py2app" should install the software, where X.Y is your favorite version of Python.

There is one new feature in this release: experimental support for python 3.   This basicly means that I managed to build a single application as a standalone application bundle, without much testing.   Alias builds and plugin bundles almost certainly don't work (the first because alias builds use the Carbon module which isn't available in python 3, the latter because I had to rewrite the C code in the application bundles and probably have to do the same for plugin bundles).

== Notes ==

Execute a bundled app from the commandline to see error messages:

  myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp

== Link Collection ==

Current repository:

 checkout and install. install with "python setup.py install"
 or let easy_install do it for you.

 '''ATTENTION''' some things are in /Library/Python and some things
 in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ and there is /usr/lib/python too.

Original version:

  * source http://undefined.org/python (points to repository)
  * documentation http://undefined.org/python/py2app.html (might be old)

=== Problems before 0.5 ===

 * for 64-bit systems, the pypi package (0.4.2) failed.
   even with macholib, altgraph and modulegraph gathered from all around.
 * here
 is some workaround http://hg.hardcoded.net/py2app, 
   that i have not tested, as macholib is missing

=== current state 0.5.2 ===


=== questions ===

is it really necessary to run 'python setup.py py2app' with sudo ?

it writes into /Library ?

and there still is an error that :: 

 '/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/py2app-0.5-py2.6.egg/py2app/apptemplate/prebuilt/main-i386'

is missing. There is only ::

  main-fat3	main-intel	main-universal

linking main-fat3 to main-i386 ::

  'cd /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/py2app-0.5-py2.6.egg/py2app/apptemplate/prebuilt'

  'ln -s main-fat3 main-i386'

makes the build succeed, when using sudo ::

  sudo python setup-mac.py py2app

but the app crashes ::

  mine.app/Contents/MacOS/mine

  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "MySQLdb/__init__.pyc", line 19, in <module>
  File "_mysql.pyc", line 18, in <module>
  File "_mysql.pyc", line 15, in __load
  ImportError: '/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/_mysql.so' not found

_so is in the app, but not in the system (i like to keep things local)

copying _mysql.so into /usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload, cured this.

Then it works.

== Development ==

=== Python Versions ===

modulegraph/util.py requires python>=2.6 for immutable bytes by 'b"something"'.

=== Testing ===

py.test is used for testing. modulegraph/util.py contains tests in util.py.
maybe revert to unittest.
