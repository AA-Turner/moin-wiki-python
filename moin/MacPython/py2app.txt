== 2010-07 ==

=== Problems ===

 * for 64-bit systems, the pypi package (0.4.2) failed.
   even with macholib, altgraph and modulegraph gathered from all around.
 * here is some workaround http://hg.hardcoded.net/py2app, 
   that i have not tested, as macholib is missing

=== current state ===

 * http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk
 * http://svn.pythonmac.org/macholib/macholib/trunk
 * http://svn.pythonmac.org/altgraph/altgraph/trunk
 * http://svn.pythonmac.org/modulegraph/modulegraph/trunk

checkout and install. install with "python setup.py install"

'''ATTENTION''' some things are in /Library/Python and some things
in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/.

=== questions ===

is it really necessary to run 'python setup.py py2app' with sudo ?

it writes into /Library ?

and there still is an error that :: 

 '/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/py2app-0.5-py2.6.egg/py2app/apptemplate/prebuilt/main-i386'

is missing. There is only ::

  main-fat3	main-intel	main-universal

linking main-fat3 to main-i386 makes the build succeed, but the app crashes

I did not try main-intel or universal yet.

== Development ==

=== Python Versions ===

modulegraph/util.py requires python>=2.6 for immutable bytes by 'b"something"'.

=== Testing ===

py.test is used for testing. modulegraph/util.py contains tests in util.py.
maybe revert to unittest.
