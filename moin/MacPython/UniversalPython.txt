Differences between MacPython 2.4.1 and Universal Python 2.4.2:

 * {{{/ApplicationsMacPython-2.4}}} is now {{{/Applications/Python 2.4}}}
 * PythonIDE, /PackageManager are gone.  These applications have been deprecated for quite a long time, and depend on [http://www.merzwaren.com/waste/ WASTE], which is somewhat non-free and is not available for x86.
 * select.poll and related constants exist on systems that have a correct poll implementation (definitely 10.4.4).
 * pythonw is now an executable that does an execv (instead of a script), so it may be used in #!scripts
 * All extensions and the framework are built universal for ppc and i386
 * The MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET defaults to 10.3, and extensions are built such that they will probably be compatible with 10.3.9+
 * Versions of Mac OS X prior to 10.3.9 are not supported with this build

Unfinished differences between MacPython 2.4.1 and Universal Python 2.4.2:

 * The Python HTML documentation is now in ``Python.framework/Versions/2.4/Doc/html``, which IDLE knows about.
 * The python in the bin directory is now also pythonw, so pythonw is only necessary for legacy purposes.
 * The installer places the framework's bin directory on the ``PATH`` for normal shells

Patches in Universal Python 2.4.2 vs Python 2.4.2 source trees:

 * select.poll brokenness detection is moved from configure time to runtime
 * CONFIGURE_MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is now MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
 * distribution scripts have been rewritten in python rather than a hodgepodge of makefiles
 * /PythonLauncher is built without xcode/pbxbuild
