http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html

As an almost complete MacPython 2.3 installation is already included in Panther by Apple the only thing you need is the MacPython 2.3 for Panther addons installer, which contains the IDE, the ../PackageManager and the waste module on which they depend. This is the second build of the additions, in comparison with the first build this version allows you to install the full Python documentation and it fixes an IDE startup bug
