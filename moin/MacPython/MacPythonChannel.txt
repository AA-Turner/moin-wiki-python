The "official" chat room for the MacPython community is the [irc://irc.freenode.net/#macpython #macpython] channel on the irc.freenode.net network.  This IRC channel supersedes the old MacPython AIM/iChat chat room.

Topics:

 * MacPython
 * ["../PyObjC"]
 * newbie questions
 * dev questions

If you're new to IRC, or are looking for a nice Cocoa IRC client, we highly recommend [http://colloquy.info/ Colloquy].
