Powerpoint and Word have extensive Applescript dictionaries.

Here's how to get the path of the folder of the current document in Word, and the name of the file:

{{{
  from appscript import *
  a = app("Microsoft Word")
  path = a.active_document.path()
  file = a.active_document.name()
  print path, file
}}}
