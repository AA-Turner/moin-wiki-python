I (DonovanPreston) have been noodling around with wrapping the low level /CoreAudio APIs necessary to generate sound on Mac OS X using Python. After struggling with threading and callbacks into Python issues I managed to get a simple hello world going which just plays a sine wave for 5 seconds. The bulk of the code is in a pyrex file here:

And here is the simple driver python script:

You compile the pyrex to a c file, and then there is a setup script which will build the extension module:
