= /RoboFab =

LtrWiki:RoboFab is a Python package written by LtrWiki:TalLeming, /ErikVanBlokland and JustVanRossum. It started its life as an attempt for a better Python scripting layer for LtrWiki:FontLab, but it has grown to a platform and application independent library of font and glyph objects and tools.

== status ==

LtrWiki:RoboFab is currently at version 1.1, public release.
