wiki:LtrWiki/RoboFab is a Python package written by wiki:LtrWiki/TalLeming, /ErikVanBlokland and JustVanRossum. It started its life as an attempt for a better Python scripting layer for wiki:LtrWiki/FontLab, but it has grown to a platform and application independent library of font and glyph objects and tools.

== status ==

wiki:LtrWiki/RoboFab is currently at version 1.1, public release.
