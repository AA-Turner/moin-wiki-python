= aeve =
aeve is a near-complete rewrite of the Apple Event support (gensuitemodule, etc.) for Python. It's extremely pythonic and easy to use, but it's chattier than doing it "raw" and currently does not support any kind of asynchronous mode. This is normally not an issue, but I'm looking into adding that sort of stuff. The version posted below is a work in progress, your mileage may vary. I'd like to hear from you if you do anything with it, especially if you have any contributions (bugfixes, example code, etc.), problems or suggestions. Note that it's only going to work in Python 2.3 or later.
