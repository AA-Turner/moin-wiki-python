Just van Rossum is a Dutch (typo)graphic designer / MacPython guru. Started the /LettError virtual type foundry with ErikVanBlokland, with whom he worked at [http://www.metadesign.com/ Meta Design]. Fame came with the release of Beowolf (co-designed with ErikVanBlokland), a font whose ragged edges shift randomly each time you print the font. He's the developer of the ["/MacPythonIDE"], designed the popular [http://starship.python.net/~just/pythonpowered/ Python Powered] logo, developed /DrawBot and FontTools, helps out with ["PyObjC"] and MacPython, etc.

We've started a page with notes about learning Cocoa using ["/PyObjC"]: LtrWiki:StartCocoa
