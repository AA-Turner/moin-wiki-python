Since the beginning of time, MacPython/FileMakerPro has been shipping with an 'Apple Events Reference' database, full of information about its OSA support and providing tons of macPython/AppleScript examples...

Good news: I'm almost finished translating these examples to Appscript... stay tuned ! :-)
