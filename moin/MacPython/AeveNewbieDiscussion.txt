= How to use aeve for newbies =

This aeve module sounds great, exactly what I've been looking for, but I must say that I have been having a ton of trouble getting things to work.  Some more documentation would really help.  To see what I can add to the effort, I've added this page to jot down my findings. - ../WinstonWolff Nov 03

''' Q: How do I Install this thing?'''
A: In order to install aeve on Panther you need these modules: - ww nov 03
      1. pyrex - http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
      2. ../LaunchServices - available on this Mr. Ippolitti's website: http://undefined.org/python/#LaunchServices
      3. TECManager - also at undefined.org
      4. Finally, you can install aeve.  I installed all of the above using "python setup.py build" and then "sudo python setup.py install"

''' Q: How do I get started?  I know Python, but I don't know a thing about ../AppleScript.'''
A: To get a primer on how to "read" ../AppleScript and understand it as a Python programmer, I found Apple's "!AppleScript Language Guide" the most useful. - ../WinstonWolff Nov 03

''' Q: I've seen the iCal example of how to "make" an object, but I want to automate Omni Graffle.  How do I create these properties to pass into make()?  I've tried the following, but the iter Objects For Name() doesn't work.'''

{{{
#!python
import aeve
app = aeve.talkto('/Applications/OmniGraffle.app')
from aeve.Applications import ../OmniGraffle as og
origin 	= og.shape._aereg_.iterObjectsForName("origin", aekind="property", deep=True).next()
size 	= og.Standard_Suite._aereg_.iterObjectsForName("size", aekind="property", deep=True).next()
name 	= og.Standard_Suite._aereg_.iterObjectsForName("name", aekind="property", deep=True).next()

shape = app.make(new=og.shape, with_properties={ origin:(100,100), size:(20,20), name:"Circle" } )
}}}
