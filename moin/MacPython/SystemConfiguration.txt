Note on a solution to problems running the installer for SystemConfig 0.3 on a MacBook Pro running OS 10.4:

Bob:

I was trying to install the SystemConfig python wrapper in order to use Nicholas Riley's OpenVPN helper script 
(http://njr.sabi.net/2005/08/04/overriding-dns-for-domains-in-os-x-tiger/ )

I'm not a python expert by any stretch, but when I ran  "setup.py install", I got this error:

warngin: no files found matching '*' under directory 'build/lib.macosx-10.3-fat-2.4/SystemConfiguration/UNSystemConfiguration.framework'


Changing this line in the setup.py script:
        template = ['recursive-include build/lib.%s-%s/%s/UNSystemConfiguration.framework *' % (get_platform(), get_python_version(), NAME),],

to this:
        template = ['recursive-include build/lib.%s-%s/%s/ Default/UNSystemConfiguration.framework *' % (get_platform(), get_python_version(), NAME),],

finds the files and eliminates the warning.

Is this something which should be fixed?  Or did I misunderstand something about the install process?  
If I just failed to read some instructions, then forgive my oversight.

I just tried to add the above to http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/SystemConfiguration to no avail.  Perhaps someone with patience could add
