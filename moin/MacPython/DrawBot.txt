[http://drawbot.com DrawBot]  is a simple application for MacOSX that allows you to write simple Python scripts that generate two-dimensional graphics. The builtin graphics primitives are currently pretty braindead, it currently only supports rectangles, ovals and (bezier) paths and polygons. A future version will also support text and images.
 
Currently developed by JustVanRossum.
 
BobIppolito and BrendanHall are hacking on a !DrawBot based project that includes dynamic GUI generation (using [http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/ GNUStep Renaissance]) and more, it will probably end up being a fork as the plans are to become a tool for designing, not so much for teaching. You can download the prototype, which includes a self-contained application and the source from the links section. Here's a screenshot: [[BR]]
