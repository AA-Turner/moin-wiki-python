Here's where you should list packages that you would like to see available in a MacPython/PackageManagerRepository.  You should also note if there is a new version out that you would like to see.

  * RPy
  * SciPy
  * MayaVi
  * wxPython (automatic installer, not dmg)
  * PyQt
  * Tkinter (automatic installer for ../TclTkAqua)
  * Chaco
  * pySerial
  * eric3
  * ../VisualPython ported to Aqua rather than X on OS X 
  * OssAudioDev - or some cross-platform access to the audio system
