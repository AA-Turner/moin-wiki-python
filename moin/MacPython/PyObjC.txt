= PyObjC =

The [[/PyObjC]] project aims to provide a bridge between the Python and Objective-C programming languages.  The bridge is intended to be fully bidirectional, allowing the Python programmer to take full advantage of the power provided by various Objective-C based toolkits and the Objective-C programmer transparent access to Python based functionality. What this really means is that you can write full fledged [[http://developer.apple.com/cocoa|"Cocoa"]] applications in pure Python.

Currently developed by RonaldOussoren, BillBumgarner, SteveMajewski, JustVanRossum, JackJansen, and others.
