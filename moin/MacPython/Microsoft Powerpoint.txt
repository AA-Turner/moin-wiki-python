Powerpoint and Word have extensive Applescript dictionaries.

Here's how to get the path of the folder of the current presentation in Powerpoint, and the name of the file:

{{{
  from appscript import *
  a = app("Microsoft Powerpoint")
  path = a.active_presentation.path()
  file = a.active_presentation.name()
  print path, file
}}}
