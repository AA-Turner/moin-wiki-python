Error in MacPython 2.4.3 for Panther.

When I attempted to run idle or python I received the following message

'''
dyld: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python can't open library: /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)
Trace/BPT trap
'''

Any sugggestions as to how to resolve this.

== MySQLdb ==
I have searched and searched for a way to connect to MySQL using python without luck. I downloaded MySQLdb from [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22307&package_id=15775&release_id=491012|SourceForge.net]] but only got a different Traceback message:

{{{

How do I connect to MySQL using python on Leopard?
