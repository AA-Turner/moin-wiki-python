= Logging into Roundup =

If you have ever used your SourceForge account on the old Python bug tracker, you also have a Roundup account. To get your password,
you need to go through the "forgotten password" procedure (even though you really did not forget it on SF we do not have access to it for the Roundup tracker). On the tracker, go to "Lost your login" (XXX hyperlink), and enter your SF username into the Username field.

This will send you an email (Confirm reset of password for Tracker), where you need to follow the link. You will get another email (Password reset for tracker) which contains the new password. The two-email procedure prevents somebody else malicously resetting your password.

You then might want to change your password. You can also change the email address, so that emails won't get sent through sourceforge.net anymore.

= About Differences =

[http://roundup.sourceforge.net/ Roundup] is not hugely different from SourceForge in terms of usage.  Because the initial transition is mostly for resource reasons (i.e., to control our own tracker), the information presented for issues is almost identical to what the SF tracker had.

The largest change people will notice, though, are the additions of some Roundup-specific fields.  Those are denoted with '''NEW''' in their descriptions.  All of them help with the management of bugs and thus should be used when possible and even filled in on existing issues brought over from SF.

Another change is that of monitoring.  SF had a '''monitor''' button that subscribed you to an issue so that you always received an email on all updates.  That is now replaced by the ''nosy list''.  By entering your username on the nosy list you will receive an email every time the issue is changed.  More details can be found in the explanation of the field.

Lastly, Roundup provides an email interface to issues.  This means that you can actually post to issues by simply replying to an email that you receive.  This makes posting replies very easy as one does not need to go through the web interface if the reply does not involve changing fields or uploading files (which can be done through email as well).


= If there is a problem =

If you encounter a problem with the tracker (both in terms of it running and the transition), please create an issue at the [http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/ meta tracker].  Tracker-discuss (which is discussed below) will be notified and it will be dealt with as best as possible.


= Improving the tracker in the future =

Please remember that the initial transition is not meant to drastically change how issues are handled or reported.  It is simply to get Python's issue tracker under the control of the PSF.  With that in place, discussions can begin about improving the handling of issues.

After the transition is complete and stability has been proven then discussions can begin in earnest to improve the handling of issues.  To participate in such discussions, please subscribe to the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tracker-discuss tracker-discuss] mailing list.  This list is meant to discuss the improvement and maintenance of the various trackers hosted by python.org.
