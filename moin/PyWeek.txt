PyWeek is the bi-annual Python Game Programming Challenge run at http://pyweek.org/

The PyWeek challenge:

 1. Invites entrants to write a game in one week from scratch either as an individual or in a team,
 2. Is intended to be challenging and fun,
 3. Will hopefully increase the public body of game tools, code and expertise,
 4. Will let a lot of people actually finish a game, and
 5. May inspire new projects (with ready made teams!)
