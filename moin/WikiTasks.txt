== News / Changes ==

 * [[Date(2003-02-13T00:46:26)]] - update to rev 1.168, which especially means backups on editor submits for people having a homepage, and spam protection via the `MailTo` macro
 * [[Date(2003-02-07T20:44:54)]] - update to CVS head
 * [[Date(2002-12-29T15:29:08)]] - Split up the too large frontpage into multiple head pages.
 * [[Date(2002-12-13T03:32:56)]] 
   * updated to CVS current (rev 1.166)
   * Friday the 13th lived up to the promise... several bugs fixed
   * linksThatStartWithLowerCase are not links anymore, thus boost.python/InternalDataStructures stopped to work; but ["boost.python/InternalDataStructures"] works, and on the ["boost.python"] page, `/InternalDataStructures` works too (i.e. use the short form of subpage links).
 * [[Date(2002-11-21T06:16:54)]] - updated to CVS current (rev 1.163)
 * [[Date(2002-11-06T22:40:50)]] - You can now refer to PEPs like so: '''`PEP:0123`''' -> PEP:0123
 * [[Date(2002-08-02T00:19:27)]] - Outgoing mail works now

== Things that need doing, unless they're done ==

 * Decide explicitly a convention for page deletion for unpriviliged users.
 * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
 * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s).

== Discussion ==
''Unfortunately, the ISBN links point to amazon.com, not amazon.de'' -- DanielDittmar

Well, this is hardly surprising in an English wiki. You can use full http links, though. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-26T02:01:40)]]

''I wasn't surprised, but I was thinking of adding ISBN.de http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/ to intermap.txt (now that I found how ISBN works).'' -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-26T21:14:18)]]

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Imposing (widely accepted) structure is not unwiki, actually it is a goal of refactoring. Otherwise, you end up with a spaghetti wiki, i.e. chaos. -- jh

Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summarize those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

'''''The entire point of a wiki is to capture discussion in such a way that it will be remembered IMO''''' - dhl 20020716

  That still means that you can capture from news, or from the wiki itself. Both ways are valid, but always refactoring/summarizing is A Good Thing. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-17T21:24:51)]]
----
How useful is the MailTo macro? It seems to add spam protection only in the editable version of the page, not in the plain page which is most likely to be seen be address harvesters. -- -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2003-02-22T00:39:32)]]

 Do robots open an account here? Most likely not. The trick is to shut out the bots ''without'' making it harder for humans.
