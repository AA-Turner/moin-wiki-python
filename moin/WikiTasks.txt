Things that need doing...

 * Update MoinMoin software. (./)

 * Fix up the ["Python"] and FrontPage's (./)

 * Python logo instead of MoinMoin logo, and changing the sitename (below the logo). (./)

 * Announce on c.l.p and Daily Py URL when we're fully alive

IMO we're not ready to go live yet - we need to do more:
    * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
    * Links to wiki-etiquette.
    * The FrontPage is little more the a list of links right now. Some information on what a wiki is and how to use it should be added.
    * Possibly software, documentation and community should have their own head pages
    * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s)

 * Tell Guido to link from python.org to FrontPage. ''Too late!'' (./)
   * I don't think that's so bad, a wiki lives from its community, and is not something you prepare in a dark chamber and then present (set in stone) to the world. Still, the above observations are valid, and we'll want to ''steer'' the growth into a sane structure. --jh
