''Unfortunately, the ISBN links point to amazon.com, not amazon.de'' -- DanielDittmar

Well, this is hardly surprising in an English wiki. You can use full http links, though. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-26T02:01:40)]]

''I wasn't surprised, but I was thinking of adding ISBN.de http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/ to intermap.txt (now that I found how ISBN works).'' -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-26T21:14:18)]]

IMO we're not ready to go live yet - we need to do more:
    * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
    * Links to wiki-etiquette.
    * The FrontPage is little more the a list of links right now. Some information on what a wiki is and how to use it should be added.
    * Possibly software, documentation and community should have their own head pages
    * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s)

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Imposing (widely accepted) structure is not unwiki, actually it is a goal of refactoring. Otherwise, you end up with a spaghetti wiki, i.e. chaos. -- jh

There are areas which could be moved from the regular web site to the wiki, because they live from contributions anyway. Examples would be some of the SpecialInterestGroup''''''s or the page listing editors suitable for Python. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Should we get permission to move content from the python.org webmasters first? I'd like to take up the editors page. -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-07-16T02:42:17)]]

 ''Real moving implies getting such a permission, since the HTML page has to be removed, and the links redirected to the wiki pages. Please don't just copy pages w/o informing anyone, and consider how often a page changes (i.e. if there's a real reason to take it into the wiki).'' -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-16T03:54:04)]]

 ''As you can see at PythonEditors, I've moved the [http://python.org/editors/ editors page] to the Wiki. Skip Montanaro was okay with it. The [http://python.org/hosting/ hosting page] is also a candidate for moving, according to him, but I'n not doing that right now. Anyone? '' -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-07-21T23:01:03)]]

Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summary those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

'''''The entire point of a wiki is to capture discussion in such a way that it will be remembered IMO''''' - dhl 20020716

  That still means that you can capture from news, or from the wiki itself. Both ways are valid, but always refactoring/summarizing is A Good Thing. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-17T21:24:51)]]

I've turned the Python bookstore into a set of pages, starting from the PythonBooks node.  Feel free to link to it from the FrontPage. 

Question: if you look at http://www.amk.ca/bookstore/, 
you'll notice that there were also lists of non-Python books that were useful, such as XML or database books.  This was an effort to capture the community's wisdom about which books were worth reading; is it worth continuing?  (I got few suggestions after my initial request, but maybe
having the Wiki will change that.)  Should I move over the MontyPython books, too?  --amk

After translating WikiTippDesTages, there are two questions left:

 * what does the entry about WikiBadge actually means?
   * ''things like DeleteThisPage are WikiBadge``s''
 * there is a tip about using ! to escape wiki words, but it is an optional feature and isn't activated in this wiki. Should it be enabled or should the tip be removed?
   * ''I commented it out''
 -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-08-01T00:20:37)]]
