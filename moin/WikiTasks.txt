''Unfortunately, the ISBN links point to amazon.com, not amazon.de'' -- DanielDittmar

Well, this is hardly surprising in an English wiki. You can use full http links, though. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-26T02:01:40)]]

''I wasn't surprised, but I was thinking of adding ISBN.de http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/ to intermap.txt (now that I found how ISBN works).'' -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-26T21:14:18)]]

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Imposing (widely accepted) structure is not unwiki, actually it is a goal of refactoring. Otherwise, you end up with a spaghetti wiki, i.e. chaos. -- jh
---- 
There are areas which could be moved from the regular web site to the wiki, because they live from contributions anyway. Examples would be some of the SpecialInterestGroups or the page listing editors suitable for Python. 
Real moving implies getting permission from the python.org webmasters, since the HTML page has to be removed, and the links redirected to the wiki pages. Please don't just copy pages w/o informing anyone, and consider how often a page changes (i.e. if there's a real reason to take it into the wiki).
----
Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summary those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

'''''The entire point of a wiki is to capture discussion in such a way that it will be remembered IMO''''' - dhl 20020716

  That still means that you can capture from news, or from the wiki itself. Both ways are valid, but always refactoring/summarizing is A Good Thing. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-17T21:24:51)]]

I've turned the Python bookstore into a set of pages, starting from the PythonBooks node.  Feel free to link to it from the FrontPage. 

Question: if you look at http://www.amk.ca/bookstore/, 
you'll notice that there were also lists of non-Python books that were useful, such as XML or database books.  This was an effort to capture the community's wisdom about which books were worth reading; is it worth continuing?  (I got few suggestions after my initial request, but maybe
having the Wiki will change that.)  Should I move over the MontyPython books, too?  --amk

It seems like DeleteThisPage and DeleteTestAndWelcome are used most of the time to indicate pages that should be deleted. There are now 9 pages that should be deleted. Will anything be done about them? -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-09-29T14:37:43)]]

This was posted to the PythonEditors page, where it probably doesn't belong:

''Please!! get a wiki running side-by-side with the docs eg: 1 corresponding wikiable page for every page here in the pydocs. The startup data is simply that of the docs, so just mirror their structure. Then after the wiki docs start offering lots of useful information, the actual doc writers can incorporate this. To summarize, I think python's documentation (like the lib reference) is basically a big melange of api data and some snippets of useful info. This wiki will help replace those places that just use API data to fill up space, and turn it into something better.''

This seems a bit like [the eff-bot guide to] The Standard Python Library? -- -- JohannesGijsbers [[DateTime(2002-10-15T12:02:34)]]
