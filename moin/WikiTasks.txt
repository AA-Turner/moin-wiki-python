Things that need doing...

 * Update MoinMoin software. (./)

 * Fix up the ["Python"] and FrontPage's (./)

 * Python logo instead of MoinMoin logo, and changing the sitename (below the logo). (./)

 * Announce on c.l.p and Daily Py URL when we're fully alive

IMO we're not ready to go live yet - we need to do more:
    * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
    * Links to wiki-etiquette.
    * The FrontPage is little more the a list of links right now. Some information on what a wiki is and how to use it should be added.
    * Possibly software, documentation and community should have their own head pages
    * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s)

 * Tell Guido to link from python.org to FrontPage. ''Too late!'' (./)
   * I don't think that's so bad, a wiki lives from its community, and is not something you prepare in a dark chamber and then present (set in stone) to the world. Still, the above observations are valid, and we'll want to ''steer'' the growth into a sane structure. --jh

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

There are areas which could be moved from the regular web site to the wiki, because they live from contributions anyway. Examples would be some of the SpecialInterestGroup''''''s or the page listing editors suitable for Python. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summary those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]
