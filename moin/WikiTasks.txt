== News / Changes ==

 * [[Date()]] - Split up the too large frontpage into multiple head pages.
 * [[Date(2002-12-13T03:32:56)]] 
   * updated to CVS current (rev 1.166)
   * Friday the 13th lived up to the promise... several bugs fixed
   * linksThatStartWithLowerCase are not links anymore, thus boost.python/InternalDataStructures stopped to work; but ["boost.python/InternalDataStructures"] works, and on the ["boost.python"] page, `/InternalDataStructures` works too (i.e. use the short form of subpage links).
 * [[Date(2002-11-21T06:16:54)]] - updated to CVS current (rev 1.163)
 * [[Date(2002-11-06T22:40:50)]] - You can now refer to PEPs like so: '''`PEP:0123`''' -> PEP:0123
 * [[Date(2002-08-02T00:19:27)]] - Outgoing mail works now

== Things that need doing, unless they're done ==

 * Decide explicitly a convention for page deletion for unpriviliged users.
 * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
 * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s).

''Unfortunately, the ISBN links point to amazon.com, not amazon.de'' -- DanielDittmar

Well, this is hardly surprising in an English wiki. You can use full http links, though. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-26T02:01:40)]]

''I wasn't surprised, but I was thinking of adding ISBN.de http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/ to intermap.txt (now that I found how ISBN works).'' -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-26T21:14:18)]]

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

Imposing (widely accepted) structure is not unwiki, actually it is a goal of refactoring. Otherwise, you end up with a spaghetti wiki, i.e. chaos. -- jh
---- 
There are areas which could be moved from the regular web site to the wiki, because they live from contributions anyway. Examples would be some of the SpecialInterestGroups or the page listing editors suitable for Python. 
Real moving implies getting permission from the python.org webmasters, since the HTML page has to be removed, and the links redirected to the wiki pages. Please don't just copy pages w/o informing anyone, and consider how often a page changes (i.e. if there's a real reason to take it into the wiki).
----
Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summary those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar [[DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)]]

'''''The entire point of a wiki is to capture discussion in such a way that it will be remembered IMO''''' - dhl 20020716

  That still means that you can capture from news, or from the wiki itself. Both ways are valid, but always refactoring/summarizing is A Good Thing. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-17T21:24:51)]]
