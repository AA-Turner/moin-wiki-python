If you have booted from the PythonCd, the web pages you are looking at right now are locally mirrored pages of the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/ Python.org Wiki].

The software running the PythonCd wiki is a pure Python thing: MoinMoin wiki running under TwistedMatrix (used as web server).

/!\ As you are running from CD, local changes to this wiki will be '''lost''' on reboot / power down. If you want to contribute, first go to the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/PythonCd master page on the Python.org wiki].

Is it ok to mirror the python.org wiki?

''All the pages, or just the pages you've written? You'll run into a lot of copyright trouble if you're going to try for the former. -- JohannesGijsbers''

All the pages would be easier. So we could reference to other content about python here in the wiki and wouldn't have to duplicate that doc effort on our own. As those pages are readable world-wide on this wiki, is it really a problem if they are readable on a non-profit PythonCd, too?

''Practically, probably not. It's highly unlikely anyone will sue you for copyright infringement, but it is possible. This wiki has no copyright policy, so you can only assume the rights granted in the MeatBall:DefaultCopyright. That doesn't include the right to redistribute to other sites or a CD. -- JohannesGijsbers''
