If you have booted from the PythonCd, the web pages you are looking at right now are locally mirrored pages of the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/ Python.org Wiki].

/!\ Is it ok to mirror the python.org wiki?

/!\ As you are running from CD, local changes to this wiki will be '''lost''' on reboot / power down. If you want to contribute, do it on the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/ Python.org Wiki].

The software running the PythonCd wiki is a pure Python thing: MoinMoin wiki running under ["Twisted"].
