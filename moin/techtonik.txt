=== Python wishlist ===

Core Python flaws.

 * locals() returns a variable that can be updated at any moment (and changes behavior under trace function)
 * internal representation of .py file paths is not normalized (comparisons and identity checks are impossible)

Missing features of community development process.

 * +1 on mailing list posts, on tracker comments and bugs
 * personal roadmaps listing features people find important and work on
 * de-facto roadmap for the next Python version - Trac milestones
 * real-time activity feed for http://bugs.python.org/
   * activity by module, by version

=== Component wishlist ===

Public domain or MIT preferred.

 * [[https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify|wikify]] - micro-framework for text wikification (easy to extend and debug) ([[http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/msg4572|1]], [[http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/msg2666|2]])
   * [ ] describe the "conflicting replacements" (idempotency) problem what the wikify solves
   * split text by regexp, process matched, exclude processed
   * run the next regexp on the list of text that is left
   * reassemble
 * treeworks - tools to work with 2D data structures (trees), including common visualization and debugging

=== Skill credits for readers of this page ===

Welcomed open source art:

 * 3D robot nut in Blender for rirror on Bitbucket
 * 128x128 wikify logo on Bitbucket
 * Logo for [[http://webpy.org/|web.py]]

GSoC/Help needed for tools that support Python development:

 * complete module-2-source tree map at https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/python-stdlib
   * this will allow to track changes in repository on a module level
   * this will allow to find out where a file belongs to
 * steal twisted highscores - http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/
   * and Subversion crediting - http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/conventions.html#crediting
