=== Python wishlist ===

Core Python flaws.

 * locals() returns a variable that can be updated at any moment (and changes behavior under trace function)
 * internal representation of .py file paths is not normalized (comparisons and identity checks are impossible)

Missing features of community development process.

 * +1 on mailing list posts, on tracker comments and bugs
 * personal roadmaps listing features people find important and work on
 * de-facto roadmap for the next Python version - Trac milestones

=== Component wishlist ===

Public domain or MIT preferred.

 * [[https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify|wikify]] - micro-framework for text wikification (easy to extend and debug) ([[http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/msg4572|1]], [[http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/msg2666|2]])
   * split text by regexp, process matched, exclude processed
   * run the next regexp on the list of text that is left
   * reassemble
 * treeworks - tools to work with 2D data structures (trees), including common visualization and debugging

=== Skill credits for readers of this page ===
