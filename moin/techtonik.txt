=== Python wishlist ===

Core Python 2 flaws.

 * locals() returns a variable that can be updated at any moment (and changes behavior under trace function)
 * internal representation of .py file paths is not normalized (comparisons and identity checks are impossible)
 * `-*- coding -*-` header [[http://bugs.python.org/issue17439|is not used as default encoding]] when transforming string literals in the source file
 * can not modify variables in outer scope (see nonlocal from Python 3)

Missing features of community development process.

 * +1 on mailing list posts, on tracker comments and bugs
 * personal roadmaps listing features people find important and work on
 * de-facto roadmap for the next Python version - Trac milestones
 * real-time activity feed for http://bugs.python.org/
   * activity by module, by version
 * tracker fixes
   * 'action item' issue type
   * everybody should be able to add/remove blockers
   * 'reply' link for each message to track threads
 * monthly mailing list FAQ (status) posts on busy mailing lists [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2010-March/015907.html|.]]
   * contain the most updated info on list topic
   * encourage replies with fixes
   * encourage collaborative roadmaps

PEP process improvements.

 * credit contributors, and not only authors as rereading and validating the spec requires time too
 * reduce formalism on [[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-December/123231.html|who can participate]]
 * accept edits as patches ([[https://code.google.com/p/pydotorg/source/browse/?repo=doceditor|create online editor]])
 * build list of contributors with Mercurial

Ideas:

 * Normalized Python
 * Iterative Development Process
 * Language for humans should help them save time for most frequent operations
 * Replace pipes with channels for subprocess (rotated queue of strings)

=== Component wishlist ===

Public domain or MIT preferred.

 * [[https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify|wikify]] - micro-framework for text wikification (easy to extend and debug) ([[http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/msg4572|1]], [[http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/msg2666|2]])
   * [ ] describe the "conflicting replacements" (idempotency) problem what the wikify solves
   * split text by regexp, process matched, exclude processed
   * run the next regexp on the list of text that is left
   * reassemble
 * treeworks - tools to work with 2D data structures (trees), including common visualization and debugging

=== Ideas open for the taking ===

Open Source artists wanted (credits available):

 * 3D robot nut in Blender for rirror on Bitbucket
 * 128x128 wikify logo on Bitbucket
 * Logo for [[http://webpy.org/|web.py]]

GSoC/Help needed for tools that support Python development:

 * complete module-2-source tree map at https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/python-stdlib
   * this will allow to track changes in repository on a module level
   * this will allow to find out where a file belongs to
 * steal twisted highscores - http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/
   * and Subversion crediting - http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/conventions.html#crediting

=== steAm and SMArt (dealing with complexity) ===

Canvas2D ideas:

 * redo *key status script* for PySDL2, pyprocessing and (maybe) pyglet

 * http://devinvenable.blogspot.com/2009/12/creating-digital-synth-sounds-using.html
 * http://devinvenable.blogspot.com/2010/07/opengl-intellivision-man.html

=== Language Translation Table ===

How to keep humans happy.

|| '''From''' || '''To''' || '''Comment''' ||
|| it's annoying, urgent, really serious || -- || humans don't like serious issues, remove ||
|| fix it ASAP || -- || humans read it as a direct command, become aggravated, remove ||
|| you're wrong || I'm not sure that's a good idea || humans don't like to be wrong, become demotivated ||
|| X suxx || I think Y would be a better solution that X || humans attached to X don't like when X suxx, but may like Y ||
