At #python.web we warn against using mod_python. Here's a handful of the reasons:

 1. It complicates your upgrade process, as versions of Python, Apache, and mod_python must be coordinated. The appropriate versions are not always available for some combinations.
 2. It makes user separation or chrooting of webapps impossible.
 3. If you're using PHP and mod_python, and you're using MySQL in both languages, you generally '''must''' coordinate versions of MySQL as well, or suffer lots of configuration headaches. The same applies for many other popular C libraries.
