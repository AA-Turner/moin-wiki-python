See cabal (the "haskell distutils") for an example

There is a setup.hs to drive the build/installation, and a .cabal file for the metadata. It looks like simple packages can get away with only the simple, static .cabal file + a trivial setup.hs. For things which cannot be defined statically (system dependent options, etc...), there are hooks, which are implemented in setup.hs.
