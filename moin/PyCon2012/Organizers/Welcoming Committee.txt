The Welcoming Committee provides a welcoming experience for newbies of all kinds to PyCon.  If you are new to\:

* PyCon

then the Welcoming Committee may be of service to you.

Participate
===========
Please take a moment to help us by answering the question, "How could PyCon make you feel (even) more welcome?"

Plans are being formed for the following events.

* Prior to the Tutorial Sessions, how to install a proper python development environment and how to avoid common newbie mistakes, e.g., don't rely on the default Mac python, how to use virtualenv.
* Newbie Night, to be held Thursday, March 8, 2012, to welcome all newbies of all kinds.

The Welcoming Committee is a sub-committee of the PyCon Organizers group.  Anyone who wants to own any part of Welcoming may participate.

Membership
==========

The "committee" (it's something of a joke name, since it does not meet or vote) is loosely made up of the following people, possibly plus unnamed others. Please add yourself if you wish to help.
