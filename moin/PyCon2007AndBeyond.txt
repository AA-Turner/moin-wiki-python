At this BoF, we'll begin planning for PyCon 2007, and also discuss plans for PyCon in 2008 and the following years.

Who should attend:

 * Members of the PyCon planning committee
 * Parties interested in hosting PyCon 2008

Attendees:

 * AndrewKuchling (Chair, PyCon 2007)
 * SteveHolden (Sponsorship Coordinator, PyCon 2006)

Notes:

I'd '''definitely''' like to see if we can revive our East coast University contacts for 2008. That has the potential to remove many of the commercial pressures, and coul dbe a jolly good venue too! ''SH''
