The intent of this page is to list the most commonly used Python modules, in hopes that it will provide useful for other programmers (especially beginners).

Please avoid listing modules that either:
 * You have made
 * Don't have community aproval (ie: are not widely used, are regarded as "unpythonic")

Do list modules that:
 * Get recommended often in the Tutor or comp.lang.python lists

Be warned that this list is subjective by its very nature. It's only intended as a helpful guide. It is not definitive in any way, nor should it discourage developers into developing their own modules.

Please provide a short description for each module. Try to put each module in the category that matchs it's "main" audience, since a module might fall into a couple of categories.
