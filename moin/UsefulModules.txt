= Useful Modules, Packages and Libraries =
The intent of this page is to list some of the most commonly used Python modules, in the hope that it will provide useful recommendations for other programmers (especially beginners). Remember that in addition to the listings below, there are other directories of Python modules - see PublishingPythonModules for details. Another collection of library details can be found on the [[Libraries]] page.

Be warned that this list is subjective by its very nature - it is only intended as a helpful guide. It is not definitive in any way, nor should it discourage developers from developing their own modules.

== Editorial Notes ==
Please avoid listing modules where...

 * You are one of the developers (and you just want to promote your work somewhere).
 * The modules in question do not have widespread approval or usage.
If you do want to make people aware of a module, package or library (perhaps your own), consider submitting it to one or more of the directories mentioned in PublishingPythonModules, perhaps also adding it to the topic-specific part of this site (eg. WebProgramming, GuiProgramming).

Do list modules that:

 * Get recommended often in the Tutor or comp.lang.python lists
Please provide a short description for each module. Try to put each module in the category that matches its "main" audience, since a module might fall into a number of categories.
