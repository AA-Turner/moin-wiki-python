This page documents the development of the Python Cheese Shop:

  http://cheeseshop.python.org

The PyPI (packages index, Cheese Shop web interface) code resides in SVN at:

  https://svn.python.org/packages/ (trunk,features,branches)

Requests for new Trove categories:

  Python frameworks with plugins or packages that target the framework 
  can get their own category.  The category should only be added *after* 
  such packages exist.  Complimentary packages can link to each other 
  from their descriptions, they do not need a category to link them 
  together; only when packages are provided by different people does a 
  category need to be created.  To ask for a category email 
  catalog-sig@python.org.

Patches and bug reports should be submitted to:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=66150&atid=513503

Discussion about the Cheese Shop should be had on the Catalog SIG mailing list:

  http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/catalog-sig


== TO-DO list ==

 * [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0345.html PEP for metadata 1.2] -- not finished and needs more catalog-sig discussion)
 * edit [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0243.html PEP 243] to reflect reality
 * auto-generate download_urls for package uploads
 * command-line tool to query pypi and fetch entries
 * DOAP support
 * documented procedures for "taking over" entries should the original owner of the entry go away (and any required system support)
 * better searching (eg. single search box on the front page)
 * tooltips for field labels
 * change notification emails
 * auto-compute [http://pycheesecake.org Cheesecake] scores
 * moderated user reviews and ratings

Something that's been requested, but needs much more thought and analysis to see whether it causes any problems: the ability to treat project names and versions as case-insensitive, while removing extraneous characters (as in pkg_resources.safe_name()) for 
purposes both of searching and determining name uniqueness when registering.
