This page is about development of [[http://pypi.python.org|Python Package Index]] (formerly known as Cheeseshop):

 * PyPI APIs: [[PyPIJSON|JSON]], [[PyPIXmlRpc|XMLRPC]]

== PyPI.nextgen: ==

Currently, as of 2013-11-11, PyPI is undergoing a complete rewrite from scratch, and as a result much of the information on this page is not actual. You can see preview of the new site at:

 https://warehouse.python.org/

The development moved from Mercurial (Python) to Git (C, shell). License changed from BSD-3 to Apache 2.0. Project code named 'warehouse' can be downloaded from:

 https://github.com/pypa/warehouse


== Previous PyPI version ==

"previous" version of PyPI is the code that was running on http://pypi.python.org from ... till the end of 2013. It was originally written by ... and was running on ... . The information below should help you get around the code.

 .
 The PyPI code was hosted under the Python Packaging Authority project: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi and is now on GItHub: https://github.com/pypa/pypi-legacy

== PyPI architecture and endpoints ==


PyPI is a WSGI application that can be executed standalone using `python pypi.wsgi` command if all requirements are met. `pypi.wsgi` contains usual WSGI wrapper code and delegates request processing to `WebUI.run()` method from `webui.py`. This method just opens DB and handles exceptions, actual request processing is done in `WebUI.inner_run()`. This method analyzes URL endpoint and executes appropriate handler. As of 2011-04, the rules to match endpoints to handlers are the following:



||/simple ||WebUI.run_simple() ||dump all package names on single html page ||
||/simple/(.+)/ ||WebUI.run_simple() ||dump all links for a package in html list ||
||/serversig/(.+)/ ||.run_simple_sign() ||save as above, but signed by server ||
||/mirrors ||.mirrors() ||display static page with a list of mirrors ||
||/daytime ||.daytime() ||display current server time ||





...


XML-RPC requests are detected by CONTENT_TYPE=`text/xml` variable in CGI environment and processed by `rpc.RequestHandler().__call__()`. List of XML-RPC "endpoints" is available on [[PyPIXmlRpc]] page.


== Testing Your Stuff Against PyPI ==


If you need to test stuff against PyPI (registration, uploading, API activities) then please use the alternative server "testpypi.python.org".


== TO-DO list ==


 * A dump of download counts.
 * A big structured dump of all package meta-data.
 * A link from package to RTFD.
 * [[http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0345.html|PEP for metadata 1.2]] -- not finished and needs more catalog-sig discussion)
 * documented procedures for "taking over" entries should the original owner of the entry go away (and any required system support)
 * tooltips for field labels
 * change notification emails
 * per-classifier "wiki" content to allow description and discussion around each classifier (perhaps what packages are available and how they relate to one another)
 * screenshot images (with thumbnailing and a "latest screenshot" on the front page?) - or perhaps icons instead of thumbnails for some packages?


Something that's been requested, but needs much more thought and analysis to see whether it causes any problems: the ability to treat project names and versions as case-insensitive, while removing extraneous characters (as in pkg_resources.safe_name()) for purposes both of searching and determining name uniqueness when registering.


=== Done ===


 * command-line tool to query pypi and fetch entries: [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk|yolk]]


== Not Going TO-DO ==


 * Edit [[http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0243.html|PEP 243]] to reflect reality. The interface is implemented in the distutils register and upload commands. This code is good enough for documentation, especially because it's the only implementation necessary.
 * moderated user reviews and ratings (this would require quite a lot of support from volunteers though)


== Proposals ==


 * [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/EnhancedPyPI|EnhancedPyPI]] Enhance multiple package index servers support in Distutils.


== Development Environment Hints ==


WARNING: Most of the information in here are out of date, see the instruction on the PyPI-legacy GitHub repository for more information, and most likely ask the developers for hints before trying to work on PyPI locally on your own !

PyPI uses postgresql 8.3 as a database, with a roll it yourself web framework based on different python modules. It uses apache2 as the web server.


It can run using wsgi, cgi, fcgi and mod_python.


Before restoring database, "pypi" role must exists:





{{{
  createuser pypi
}}}


These are notes so we can remember how to dump / restore the packages database:





{{{
  pg_dump -Fc -b packages >packages-20060706.dump
  createdb packages
  pg_restore -O -d packages -Fc packages-20060706.dump
}}}


Ask [[RichardJones|RichardJones]] if you need a database dump. Note that dumps should not be imported into an existing database that has had the pkdump_schema.sql DDL script run against it. The pg_dump file will create all of the database tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, etc. that are required.


[[PageTemplates|PageTemplates]] are obtained from:





{{{
  svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.pagetemplate/trunk zope.pagetemplate
  svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.tal/trunk zope.tal
  svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.interface/trunk zope.interface
  svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.i18nmessageid/trunk zope.i18nmessageid
  svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.tales/trunk zope.tales
}}}


We also need to install ez_setup, celementtree, docutils, psycopg2, and [[M2Crypto|M2Crypto]].


# For debian, this should get you most of the dependencies. apt-get install zope3 python-celementtree python-psycopg


Then go ahead and edit pypi.ini and this line in pypi.cgi:





{{{
  cfg = config.Config('/tmp/pypi.ini', 'webui')
}}}


if your config.ini isn't in /tmp/pypi.ini. You can leave it as 'config.ini' if it's in the same directory as pypi.py.


You will need to add cheesecake_password=yourpasshere into the config.ini in the webui section.


To integrate it with Apache, we recommend to use WSGI through mod_wsgi. Your configuration should look like this:





{{{
   WSGIDaemonProcess pypi display-name=wsgi-pypi python-path=/usr/lib/zope2.9/lib/python processes=4 threads=1
   WSGIProcessGroup pypi
   WSGIPassAuthorization On
   WSGIScriptAlias /pypi /data/pypi/src/pypi/pypi.wsgi
   WSGIScriptAlias /simple /data/pypi/src/pypi/pypi.wsgi
}}}
