Cheese Shop Development

This page documents the development of the Python Cheese Shop:

  http://cheeseshop.python.org

The PyPI (packages index, Cheese Shop web interface) code resides in SVN at:

  https://svn.python.org/packages/ (trunk,features,branches)

Requests for new Trove categories:

  Python frameworks with plugins or packages that target the framework 
  can get their own category.  The category should only be added *after* 
  such packages exist.  Complimentary packages can link to each other 
  from their descriptions, they do not need a category to link them 
  together; only when packages are provided by different people does a 
  category need to be created.  To ask for a category email 
  catalog-sig@python.org.

Patches and bug reports should be submitted to:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=66150&atid=513503

Discussion about the Cheese Shop should be had on the Catalog SIG mailing list:
