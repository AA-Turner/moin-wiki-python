There have been many proposals for changes and improvements to `distutils`,
but any actual activity on improving `distutils` appears to have come to a
complete halt.  All activity has moved to third-party tools which layer
on top of `distutils`.

There is a case to be made for integrating the best of the enhancements
directly into `distutils` itself, with the most important being shared
maintenance and making the tools readily available for use by smaller
distributions.  Currently, many larger distributions of Python code are
incorporating `distutils` extensions directly into their distributions.
This isn't much of a problem for large distributions (like Zope and PEAK),
but seems out of place for smaller distributions of a single pakcage
(like `ZConfig`).

The extensions which we should consider adding directly to distutils
include:

 * Support for installing both modules and packages from a single distribution.

 * Support for more easily installing data files into a package.  Phillip Eby's `setuptools` has implemented one reasonable approach to this; there may be others.

 * The ability to install packages into other packages without having to hack around in ''setup.py'' scripts.  (For example, the option to install `zope.app.sqlscripts` into an existing installation of `zope.app`.)

 * Some ability to use more declarative forms of metadata from ''setup.py'' without having to write a pile of extension code.  This is being explored some at Zope Corporation.

 * Dependency support.  This is also being worked on by Phillip Eby, but it would be nice to get more information from the community about the requirements.

If any `distutils`-related sprints emerge, hopefully there can be a progress
report from that; it is not yet clear that there will be a distutils sprint.
