== Intro ==

Python provides a 'Python/C API' that allows you to create C/C++ 
extension modules and to embed the Python interpreter in your C/C++ 
programs. Pointers to Py``Objects are the Python/C API's way to use Python 
objects from the C/C++ side.

BoostPython uses advanced C++ techniques to provide a much easier 
interface to the Python/C API. One manifestation of this is in 
python::object which is basically a (very) convenient, high-level 
wrapper around Py``Object*. A lower level wrapping around Py``Object* is 
python::handle.

=== self ===

When a python class is being inherited from a c++
class, one must write a c++ wrapper around the c++
class.

This wrapper must have a pointer to a Py``Object called
self. It's the Python object which contains the C++ object instance.


== Memory consumption ==

In general, a wrapped C++ object with a corresponding Python object is
the size of:
  * a new-style class (derived from 'object' in Python) instance plus
  * the extra size required to allow variable-length data in the instance, plus
  * the size of the C++ object, plus
  * the size of a ''vtable'' pointer, plus
  * a pointer to the C++ object's instanceholder, plus
  * zero or more bytes of padding required to ensure that the instanceholder is properly aligned.  

You can see this in {{{boost/python/object/instance.hpp}}}. Most Python
objects are represented by {{{instance<value_holder<T> >}}}, for some C++ class T.

All the code for implementing C++ object wrappers is in
{{{libs/python/src/object/class.cpp}}}.  

Instance dictionaries are created only "on demand", the first time the instance's __dict__ attribute is
accessed (see instance_get_dict).
{{{
    >>> a = A()  # some extension class A, no instance dict
    >>> a.x      # Attribute lookup fails, still no instance dict
    Traceback ...

    >>> a.y = 1  # y is a C++ data member, still no instance dict
    >>> a.x = 1  # creates an instance dict
    >>> z = A()
    >>> z.__dict__  # also creates an instance dict
}}}

If your C++ data structure contains pointers or smart pointers, you
can arrange for Python objects to be created which only embed those
pointers (instance<pointer_holder<Ptr> >). These Python objects will
be in existence only as long as your Python code holds a reference to
them.
