== Introduction ==

The BoostPython Library binds C++ and Python in a mostly-seamless fashion. It is just one member of the boost C++ library collection at http://www.boost.org.

Use the BoostPython Library to quickly and easily export C++ to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++ classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python. The system should simply ''reflect'' your C++ classes and functions into Python. Boost.Python bindings are written in pure C++, using no tools other than your editor and your C++ compiler.

The Python [http://www.python.org/sigs/c++-sig/ C++-sig] serves as a mailing list for users of the library. Documentation for the current release is available at http://www.boost.org/libs/python/. Development documentation, which is usually more up-to-date, is available through the [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/boost/boost/libs/python/doc/index.html Boost CVSWeb] interface.
