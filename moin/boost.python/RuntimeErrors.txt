["boost.python"] tries hard to provide best possible run-time errors.
But often enough they need futher explanation.
Some of them are mentioned below:

==== TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation ====
Usualy means BPL couldn't find c++ method/function with appropriate signature.
Very often that is wrong number of arguments, wrong argument(s) type and so on.
