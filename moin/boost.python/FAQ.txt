1. ''The constructors of some classes I am trying to wrap are private because
instances must be created by using a factory. Is it possible to wrap such
classes using bpl v2?''

Sure. Of course you can only create the instances using the factory...
  
If you look at libs/python/test/test_pointer_adoption.cpp you'll see the
factory function "create" is being used to generate new instances of class
A. It uses return_value_policy<manage_new_object> to instruct Python to
adopt the A* to hold the instance.
{{{
A* create(std::string const& s)
{
    return new A(s);
}

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE_INIT(test_pointer_adoption_ext)
{
        def("num_a_instances", num_a_instances);

        // Specify the manage_new_object return policy to take
        // ownership of create's result
        def("create", create, return_value_policy<manage_new_object>());
        
        class_<A>()
            .def("content", &A::content)
            .def("get_inner", &A::get_inner, return_internal_reference<>())
        ;
}
}}}

2. ''What is the relation between this '''no_init''' and '''boost::noncopyable?'''''

The only relationship is that they both deal with constructors.
 *  `no_init` means "do not try to define a Python __init__ function"
 *  `noncopyable` means "do not try to register a converter which can convert C++ T return values to python".
