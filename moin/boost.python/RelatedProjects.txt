From DavidAbrahams:

Boost.Python is designed with the idea in mind that users never touch a Py``Object*.

Boost.Python depends on quite a few of the other boost libraries (possibly a few others):
 *  type_traits
 *  bind
 *  function
 *  mpl
 *  smart_ptr

IIUC, ["weave"] can be used for embedding nontrivial C++ code, if you're
willing to stick it all inside one function body. Furthermore, tools like
weave.blitz() can make an enormous difference by compiling an entire C++
expression template corresponding to an arbitrarily complicated Python
expression. Surely that's nontrivial. It's definitely ''cool''. I think weave
offers enormous power to the person who's programming mostly in Python.
