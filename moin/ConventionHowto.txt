Rough checklist for running PyCon-style conventions.

This table intends to list every single step required to plan and carry out a conference.  ''Do not remove items'' from this list, because this isn't the to-do list for any particular year; the list of remaining tasks for a specific conference such as PyCon 2006 would be on other pages.  Do feel free to ''add'' any tasks that you think of.
