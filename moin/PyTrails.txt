Pytrails is a project for an educational game. The game is in the spirit of the Old Oregon Trail games, to be historical and interactive. The game will be written in Python to allow for flexibility for the students and children who want to play this game by using the fact that python can run under various operating systems. This allows the child to play on whatever computer they have access to, being old or new, Linux or Windows. Pygame will be the program in which Pytrails will work under, to help with the flexibility of the Operating Systems.
