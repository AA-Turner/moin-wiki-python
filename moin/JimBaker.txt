I live in Longmont, Colorado, just outside of Boulder. This is a beautiful part of the world. I consult for [http://zyasoft.com Zyasoft] and lead the [http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers Front Range Pythoneers], which is the Boulder Python users group. Here are some relevant links:

 * [http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/ Blog] - occasional useful info on concurrency, databases, Django, iterators, Jython, and what not in Python

 * [http://www.linkedin.com/in/zyasoft LinkedIn] - this gives a more corporate bio
