I live in Longmont, Colorado, just outside of Boulder. This is a beautiful part of the world. I consult for [[http://zyasoft.com|Zyasoft]] and lead the [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers|Front Range Pythoneers]], which is the Boulder Python users group. Here are some relevant links:

 * [[http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/|Blog]] - occasional useful info on concurrency, databases, Django, iterators, Jython, and what not in Python

 * [[http://www.linkedin.com/in/zyasoft|LinkedIn]] - this gives a more corporate bio
