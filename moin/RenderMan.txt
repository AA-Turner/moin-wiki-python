A generalized standard for 3d animation rendering systems, originally created by Pixar.  Often confused with Pixar's Photorealistic Renderman software, the term Renderman actually refers to a set of file formats and other conventions that otherwise divergent rendering system could use.  It is intended to be "the postscript of 3d".
