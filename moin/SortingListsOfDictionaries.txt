= Sorting Lists of Dictionaries =

Frequently you want to sort a list of dictionaries, based on some particular key.

For example:

{{{
#!python
a = {"key1": 5 , "key2": 8, "key3": 2}
b = {"key1": 7 , "key2": 4, "key3": 9}
c = {"key1": 6 , "key2": 1, "key3": 1}
undecorated = [a, b, c] # how do you sort this list?
}}}

There are many ways to do this. Here's the fastest way to do it, as it avoids using a custom comparison function, instead using builtin comparisons. This is the ''decorate-sort-undecorate'' pattern, or the ''Schwartzian transform'' if you're coming from Perl.

{{{
#!python
sort_on = "key2"
decorated = [(dict_[sort_on], dict_) for dict_ in undecorated]
decorated.sort()
sorted = [dict_ for (key, dict_) in l]
}}}

In case you're wondering, the variable is named `dict_` because we want to have Wiki:MeaningfulNames, but we don't want to shadow the `dict` builtin, so we append an underscore.
