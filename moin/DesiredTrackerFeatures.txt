Desired Tracker Features
========================

Patch and Test Tracking
-----------------------
Instead of the 'needs test' and 'needs patch' stages, it would
be better to have a checkbox grid something like this::

                    NA      needs patch     has patch
        docs       ( )          ( )           ( )
        tests      ( )          ( )           ( )
        code       ( )          ( )           ( )

We could then have a 'patch incomplete' stage instead of the 'needs'
stages, where the checkboxes would make clear what things were missing.

Python Version Tracking
-----------------------
Instead of a multi-selection list for python versions, perhaps we could
have a list of versions like this::

            confirmed   will apply  committed
    3.3        ( )         ( )      [      ]
    3.2        ( )         ( )      [      ]
    3.1        ( )         ( )      [      ]
    3.0        ( )         ( )      [      ]
    2.7        ( )         ( )      [      ]
         ...

This would allow the tracker to record which versions a bug is present
in, even if it doesn't get fixed in that version, and also allow us
to track the progress when more than one version needs to be patched.
We might perhaps want to add a stage 'committing' when a patch has
been committed to one branch but not all.  (Note: for feature requests
'confirmed' would be left blank).  'will apply' would be checked when
someone determines that the patch, whether it exists or not, should be
applied to the given branch.  'committed' would be the revision in which
the patch was committed.  Ideally this would be auto-filled by the change
management system based on tags in the commit message.

If the above is deemed too complex, then we should at least have a way to
mark issues as accepted regardless of whether or not they have a complete
patch.  This is to differentiate between issues that just need work,
and issues where we haven't even decided that we are going to accept it.

This doesn't need a patch, but is noted here so the idea doesn't get
lost: it has been suggsted that an additional type of 'refactoring'
be added.

Misc
----
When an issue is closed stage should be automatically set to
'committed/rejected'.

    * confusing, 'fixed' issue is neither 'committed' nor 'rejected' at all times -- anatoly techtonik

There should be a field in which you can enter an issue number of
an issue of which this issue is a duplicate, and submitting it
should

    1) merge the nosy list from this issue into the specified issue

    2) set the resolution to duplicate

    3) close the issue (setting stage to committed/rejected per above)
        * `duplicate` would be better  -- anatoly techtonik

There should be an anchor at the top of the page linked to the last
message and other links to go back to the top of the page. This is
especially useful when there are lot of messages.

It would probably be better if the default search returned results
from closed bugs; this should cut down on the number of bug reports
for things that have already been fixed but not released. See `issue311 <http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/issue311>`__.

When a user adds a file there should be a note among the messages
(or even inside the message) with a link to the added file.
This would avoid confusion if the user says "This patch ..." and
there are several files attached.

The tracker should be in some way integrated with maintainers.rst.
It should be possible to map at least some of the "Components" in the
tracker with the "Interest areas" (e.g. "Unicode", "Windows") in maintainers.rst
and/or provide a way to consult the file while adding/editing an issue.
Another option is to add fields like "maintainer of" or "interest
areas" to the users, but it will probably be hard to keep it in sync
with maintainers.rst.
