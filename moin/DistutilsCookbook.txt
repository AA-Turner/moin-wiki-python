The Distutils Cookbook collects various useful recipes and tips for using the Distutils.

When creating new recipes, use the RecipeTemplate.

 * DistutilsInstallDataScattered -- make resource data-files get installed in the same directory tree as the Python files that depend on them
 * DistutilsAutoDataDiscovery -- specify data-files to install with smart_install_data recursively by specifying only a top-level directory
 * DistutilsAutoPackageDiscovery -- specify packages to install recursively by specifying only the top-level package
 * Jeremy Hylton has written a Python Package Index (PyPI) [http://www.python.org/~jeremy/weblog/030924.html tutorial]. This covers the use of the distutils register command.
 * DistutilsWininstFilename -- provide customisation point for altering the filename of bdist_wininst installer (such as to include numpy version information)
