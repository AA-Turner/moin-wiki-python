Q: I tried http://www.jldupont.com/services/pypirss/rss/lockfile but got an error.  Does something need to be set up for each package?

A: There is no downloads available for this package, hence no statistics on downloads.
  ERROR: Error accessing "downloads" attribute from package[lockfile]

Q: You mean no downloads since you implemented this feature, or no downloads
at all?

A: Sorry for the confusion: the XMLRPC interface to Pypi returns that an error code to the effect that no 'package_data' is available. If I look at the page on Pypi [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lockfile], I don't see one either i.e. a download URL is made available BUT there are no "uploaded files" to Pypi.

Q. Interesting.  People tell me they use lockfile, and it actually has a score
listed when you search PyPI for "lockfile".  Collecting download stats must be a relatively recent phenomenon.
