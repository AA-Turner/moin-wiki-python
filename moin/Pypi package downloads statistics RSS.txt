Download statistics for package registered on Pypi can be obtained, in RSS format, by subscribing your favorite RSS reader (e.g. GoogleReader) with the following:

Q: I tried http://www.jldupont.com/services/pypirss/rss/lockfile but got an error.  Does something need to be set up for each package?

A: There is no downloads available for this package, hence no statistics on downloads.
  ERROR: Error accessing "downloads" attribute from package[lockfile]

Q: You mean no downloads since you implemented this feature, or no downloads
at all?

A: Sorry for the confusion: the XMLRPC interface to Pypi returns that an error code to the effect that no 'package_data' is available. If I look at the page on Pypi [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lockfile], I don't see one either i.e. a download URL is made available BUT there are no "uploaded files" to Pypi.

Q. Interesting.  People tell me they use lockfile, and it actually has a score
listed when you search PyPI for "lockfile".  Collecting download stats must be a relatively recent phenomenon.

[http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPiXmlRpc Pypi XMLRPC]. I must say that the XMLRPC interface could be augmented to make it easier to derive per-package-version statistics.

Thanks.  Got it now:

Kind of a weird download distribution, but it explains things (I think).  Delete all this stuff when you tire of seeing it... -- Skip

I forget to mention that the service only fetches the stat for the latest package release on record. -- jld.
