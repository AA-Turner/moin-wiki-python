I am one of the core developers of the MoinMoin Python Wiki Engine (also used here).

I discovered wikis some years ago (and decided for MoinMoin (written by JuergenHermann) as it looked like the best engine at that time).

Soon I began hacking the MoinMoin code and thus fell in love with Python, too. Felt a bit dumb, though, and asked myself why I didn't use that great language earlier (I coded in quite some different languages, but Python beats them all).

I usually hang around on #moin IRC channel on irc.freenode.net, so if you need any MoinMoin help, feel free to contact me there.

My (mostly german) wiki homepage is at LinuxWiki:ThomasWaldmann.
