I am interested in mentoring projects for development of mathematical
libraries for (discrete) algebraic structures in Python, particularly
those projects which relate to arithmetic of abelian groups, finite
rings, and solution of algebraic equations over them, motivated by applications to cryptography.  Of particular interest are
applications which advance the development of SAGE
[http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage].
