== The Winnipeg Python Users Group ==

Welcome!  We are [http://www.python.org Python] users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We meet monthly, typically to listen to a presentation and learn from each other's experience programming in Python.  We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren't tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome.

Feel free to [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg join]
our '''mailing list''' or view the
[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/winnipeg/ archives].

=== Meeting Times and Location ===

Meetings are held the fourth Wednesday of the month from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 or 9:30 p.m.  They are held at the University of Winnipeg, currently in room 2M70, although this may move (with or without notice) to the room across the hall from 2M70.

Room 2M70 at the UW is on the second floor of Manitoba hall.  To reach this room, head up the main escalators in Centennial Hall to the 2nd floor, turn right to head east into Manitoba hall, turn left down the hallway and look for the room on your right.

If the schedule below is stale it doesn't mean we're inactive.  We've occasionally been 2 months behind updating it, but we're still meeting!
