== The Winnipeg Python Users Group ==

Welcome!  We are [http://www.python.org Python] users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We meet monthly, typically to listen to a presentation and learn from each other's experience programming in Python.  We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren't tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome.

Feel free to [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg join]
our '''mailing list''' or view the

Do you want to find out more about Python from a demo, a tutorial, or a class?  Do you have other questions about this group?  Contact [mailto:stuartw@mts.net Stuart Williams]

=== Meeting Times and Location ===

Meetings are held the fourth Wednesday of the month from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 or 9:30 p.m.  They are held at the University of Winnipeg with the specific room location listed in the schedule below.

Room 4CM04 at the UW is on the mezzanine above the 4th floor of the library.  To find this room, head up the main escalators in Centennial Hall to the 4th floor, then about-face to your right and proceed into the library. After passing the circulation desk on the left and going through the second doorway, turn right to the spiral staircase, go up one level to the mezzanine, head across to the only door on that level and into the suite of offices where the room is located.  If the door is locked, ring the bell.
