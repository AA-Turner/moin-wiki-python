== The Winnipeg Python Users Group ==

Welcome!  We are about 60 [[http://www.python.org|Python]] users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We formed in 2005 and for 3+ years we met monthly to listen to a presentation, learn from each other's experience programming in Python, or occasionally work on a project together.  Since February 2009 we have not been meeting as regularly.  Time will tell if this means we're dormant, taking a break, or just functioning as a mailing list of Python users in Winnipeg.  We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren't tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome. There is no charge to attend the meetings or join the group.

We encourage you to [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg|join]] our '''mailing list'''.  The traffic is low and it provides a point for connection to Winnipeg Python users for events, job offers, etc.  There are [[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/winnipeg/|archives]].

=== Meeting Times and Location ===
Meetings have traditionally been held the fourth Wednesday of the month from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. at the University of Winnipeg.  As of February 2010 there is some discussion on the mailing list about moving those meetings to daytime and possibly meeting sometimes downtown, sometimes at the University of Manitoba.  Our next meeting is tentatively planned for October 27th downtown -- see the list archives.
