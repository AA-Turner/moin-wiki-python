== The Winnipeg Python Users Group ==

Welcome!  We are [http://www.python.org Python] users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We meet monthly, typically to listen to a presentation and learn from each other's experience programming in Python.  We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren't tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome.

Feel free to [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg join]
our '''mailing list''' or view the

Do you want to find out more about Python from a demo, a tutorial, or a class?  Do you have other questions about this group?  Contact [mailto:stuartw@mts.net Stuart Williams]
