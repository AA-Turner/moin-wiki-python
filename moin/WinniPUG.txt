== The Winnipeg Python Users Group ==

Welcome!  We are [http://www.python.org Python] users in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba.

We meet monthly, typically to listen to a presentation and learn from each other's experience programming in Python.  We have members at all levels of experience from expert to novice, and our discussions aren't tied to any particular operating system or platform - so all are welcome. There is no charge to attend the meetings or to be a member of the Winnipeg Python Users Group.

Feel free to [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/winnipeg join]
our '''mailing list''' or view the
[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/winnipeg/ archives].

=== Meeting Times and Location ===

Meetings are held the fourth Wednesday of the month from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 or 9:30 p.m.  They are held at the University of Winnipeg in Room 3M59. The meetings used to be held in room 2M70 which is unavailable for 2007 - 2008 due to construction.

Room 3M59 at the UW is on the third floor of Manitoba hall.  To reach this room, head up the main escalators in Centennial Hall to the 3rd floor, turn right to head east into Manitoba hall, turn left down the hallway and look for the room on your left.

If the schedule below is stale it doesn't mean we're inactive.  We've occasionally been 2 months behind updating it, but we're still meeting!
