They are currently held at the University of Winnipeg in room 5C02 on the fifth floor of the library.  To find this room, head up the main escalators in Centennial Hall to the 4th (not 5th) floor, then about-face to your right and proceed into the library.  After passing the circulation desk on the left and going through the second doorway, turn right to the spiral staircase, go up to the 5th floor (past the mezzanine), and follow the curved wall around to your left.
