The International Python Conference (IPC) is held anually, in the U.S., more or less in the end of their winter. The biggest names in the community gather there and make talks; it's a great opportunity to meet people. In the past it was also used to make decisions about the future of Python, and there is talk of bringing this aspect back in the next conferences.
