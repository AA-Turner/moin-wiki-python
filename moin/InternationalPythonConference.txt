For much of the 1990s, the International Python Conference was held annually in the U.S, organized by a professional conference management firm.  The conferences were quite expensive yet reportedly lost money, so eventually the firm stopped holding the conferences.  The IPC conferences have been replaced by the volunteer-run PyCon; the O'Reilly Open Source Conference also has Python-related content.  European conferences have formed, notably EuroPython and ["PythonUK"].
