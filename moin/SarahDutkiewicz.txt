== Sarah Dutkiewicz ==

I'm the PyOhio Publicity Pythonista for PyOhio 2009, and I look forward to getting the word out about this awesome event.

My Python involvement right now is still young - I spoke at PyCon 2009 on IronPython, and I speak in the Microsoft Heartland District (OH/MI/KY/TN) on IronPython.  I hope to have an IronPython Getting Started Guide up on my site soon.

If you want to get a hold of me, I can be reached at <sarah AT codinggeekette DOT com>.
