=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

Draco has an integrated session management mechanism. Sessions can be logged in and made persistent. Authentication has to be performed in the application.

=== Persistence Support ===

Draco make use of the namespace concept. A namespace is a place where you can store (almost) arbitrary Python variables using the Python dictionary API (ns['varname'] ect.). There are different namespaces, some of which are persistent. These include the ''session'', ''user'', ''application'' and ''server'' namespace.
