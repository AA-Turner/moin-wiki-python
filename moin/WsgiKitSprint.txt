This will be a sprint on [http://svn.colorstudy.com/trunk/WSGIKit WSGIKit], and by association [http://webwareforpython.org Webware] and [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html WSGI].  Really the emphasis will be on building reusable framework-neutral WSGI middleware to help replicate (and improve!) Webware's functionality; so you don't have to be interested in Webware to participate, you just have to be interested in Python web programming.

Discussion should take place on webware-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
