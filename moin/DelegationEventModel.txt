I'm no pattern expert, but I believe the accepted name for this pattern is Wiki:ObserverPattern. You've combined it in your example with the Wiki:CommandPattern, which I think is unnecessary for the point you are trying to make. (Which, I believe, is the Observer``Pattern.)

I'd make ''two'' pages on this wiki; One for the CommandPattern, and one for the ObserverPattern, both demonstrating the code in Python, and talking about it specificly from the perspective of Python. I would link ''both'' pages to their Wiki:PortlandPatternRepository equivalents. It's true that it's messy over there, some times, but until we get a wiki with higher [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/community/DegreesOfEditorialControl|DegreesOfEditorialControl,]] C2 wiki is the canonical place for talking about design patterns in the abstract on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/community/ThePublicWeb|the public web.]]

I do not think so. Look at [[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/awt/1.3/designspec/events.html|DEMAtSun]]. Note that the Wiki:CommandPattern is slightly different but not that far or it might also be an instanciation of the DelegationEventModel...
What I'm trying to do is to add usefull code here so I may be wrong on the name... ;-)

So, adjust Wiki:CommandPattern, to include your case, or make a new page on C2? I guess my basic idea is: I think it would be cool to cooperate with C2. :)
