## page was renamed from WikiTasks

== Things that need doing, unless they're done ==

 * We need a mission statement on the front page. What it's for, who can/should participate.
 * Need to create a discussion / ask for help section(s).
 * Theme-related suggestions by LionKimbro <<DateTime(2006-03-25T16:48:34Z)>>:
   * Replace current icons with more common images - for example, current edit icon `python.org/img/moin-edit.png` is hard to associate with action
   * If possible, make the icons text, instead of icons?
   * "Toggle Line Numbers" draws way too much attention to itself; ''Especially'' when you have only 2 or 3 lines of code! Remove it entirely, or make it much smaller, or (whatever.)
     * Or use `numbers=disable` in the code regions. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2009-12-09T17:07:42+0100)>>
   * Bullet point items are spread too far apart. Less white space above and below them.
   * If I could, I'd make the top bar half as tall as it is.
   * I'd try to find a way to either (A) eliminate the sidebar, or (B) make it editable. That way, regulars could maintain it. (ex: see [[http://www.communitywiki.org/en/FrontPage|the CommunityWiki SideBar,]] which [[http://www.communitywiki.org/cw?action=edit;id=SideBar|is editable]])

== Discussion ==
''Unfortunately, the ISBN links point to amazon.com, not amazon.de'' -- DanielDittmar

Well, this is hardly surprising in an English wiki. You can use full http links, though. -- JürgenHermann <<DateTime(2002-07-26T02:01:40)>>

''I wasn't surprised, but I was thinking of adding ISBN.de http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/ to intermap.txt (now that I found how ISBN works).'' -- DanielDittmar <<DateTime(2002-07-26T21:14:18)>>

Some ideas about the aims of this wiki:

What I would like to use this Wiki for is for comparisons between Python packages. Most areas seem to have multiple solutions. Is it very unwiki to impose some structure like I did in WebProgramming and trying to keep it up? GuiProgramming and IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages are also candidates for this kind of style. -- DanielDittmar <<DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)>>

Imposing (widely accepted) structure is not unwiki, actually it is a goal of refactoring. Otherwise, you end up with a spaghetti wiki, i.e. chaos. -- jh

Discussions about Python should be held on comp.lang.python and the SIGs, but it is OK to summarize those discussions in the wiki. -- DanielDittmar <<DateTime(2002-07-15T02:21:48)>>

'''''The entire point of a wiki is to capture discussion in such a way that it will be remembered IMO''''' - dhl 20020716

  That still means that you can capture from news, or from the wiki itself. Both ways are valid, but always refactoring/summarizing is A Good Thing. -- JürgenHermann <<DateTime(2002-07-17T21:24:51)>>

What kind of conversation are we talking about?

 * Philosophy - I don't care where it goes (usenet, here, C2, elsewhere)
 * "How does this piece work?" - it works great here

"How does this work" has been great. If you need me to back this up for you, I can back it up with many anecdotes; Most of the pages I write here have seen some related action. People tell me that they read and use (and correct) my pages, and it'd be sad to see that come to an end.

The only thing that annoys me are pages with questions for names. Instead, the page name should be the name of the piece, and then the question should appear on the page. That is, [[How can "normal" users report bugs in Python or the documentation?]] should be a page called PythonDocumentation, and then the question attached to ''that'' page.

-- LionKimbro <<DateTime(2005-09-15T22:31:31Z)>> [[[lwickjr]]: Sorry about that, Lion. :I ]

I think this Wiki would best serve as continuing from where standard Python documentation
left off: showing examples of use, adding information about good packages not existing in the standard distribution, and talking about higher-level stuff like 'tips for parallel processing'. Examples are very important for newcomers, and hey, many people like to learn new things first from examples, and dive into reference when details become important (including me). As for discussing Python in general, I think c.l.p is invaluable and needs no replacement - so I guess I'm along the same lines as DanielDittmar and JürgenHermann. -- EdvardMajakari <<DateTime(2005-09-15T15:14:13Z)>>
