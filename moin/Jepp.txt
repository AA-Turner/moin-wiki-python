Its [[http://jepp.sourceforge.net/|home page]] advertises
Jepp as "Java Embedded Python".  While that same home page rather mysteriously suggests that "Java-based languages" may be "massive[ly]" slower than [[CPython]], and likely to "suddenly change widely-used features", its characterizations of Jepp itself are not problematic:  Jepp appears to handle threading reliably, for example.

Be careful to distinguish Jepp from [[JPype]].
