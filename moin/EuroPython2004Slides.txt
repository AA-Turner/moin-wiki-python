If you are a speaker at EuroPython2004 looking for somewhere to upload your slides, you've come to the right place!

If you can upload your slides to your own website, you can do that and add a link in the appropriate section of that page.  Alternatively, you can get a link or the slides into the hands of MichaelHudson (mwh@python.net) and he'll sort things out.
