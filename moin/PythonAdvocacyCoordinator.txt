In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire JeffreyRush for full-time work on ["Advocacy"].

["AdvocacyAccomplishments"]

My prototype of the advocacy site has been fully ported over the advocacy.python.org and checked into svn.python.org.  The site is up and down as I'm working on it, however I have established a clone of the site at advocacy.dfwpython.org.  The clone will be the development site and advocacy.python.org will be the production site, with a subversion check-in/check-out cycle used to catch the production site up with development.

Current Tasks:

 * Write up authoring guidelines, for web content, whitepapers
   and flyers, so as others contribute documentation, it is
   consistent in appearance and tone.
 * Add additional content to the advocacy site re answering common questions from the perspective of various audiences.
 * Get my installation of Pyramid working and begin adding links from www.python.org to the advocacy site.

----
Existing Challenges (most recent at top):

 * I have been spending (too much) time on PyCon and need to refocus on other forms of advocacy.
 * I have found a huge amount of really great Python material scattered on sites and am trying to organize/link it into the advocacy site.  A good situation to be in but a lot of reading and evaluating.
 * An Apache process on ximinez.python.org machine was leaking memory and swapping like crazy, slowing everything considerable.  Sean R. changed Apache from a threading to a process model and the problem has not reoccurred.

----
Future Tasks (in order of priority, from most urgent to least):

 * Refine component for organizing advocacy files; collapse documents in different formats into one entry with format icons; provide an upload link into a quarantine area, provide for searching for tagged files re all slide presentations, all flyer handouts, etc.
 * Implement a component to establish a database of user groups,
   with an RSS feed and searchable by geographic location.
 * Ping pydotorg for site statistics, if they already exist.
 * Finish processing the audio recordings from past !PyCons.
 * Figure out how to integrate Nabu with subversion, such that documents maintain an audit trail.
 * Encourage adoption of a standard presentation template for !PyCon.
 * For !PyCon:
    * rename Apache rewrite rule from "apps" to "apps06".
    * rename fastcgi start/stop scripts  to have "06" in them.
    * rename the django/pycon directory to django/pycon06
    * update the sudo config for the renamed files.
 * Further restyling of us.pycon.org website
 * Install the python api for subversion, so I can directly manipulate repositories, as needed.
