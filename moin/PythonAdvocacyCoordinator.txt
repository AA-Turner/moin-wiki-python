In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire JeffreyRush
for full-time work on ["Advocacy"].

----
["AdvocacyAccomplishments"]

----
Current Tasks:

 * Migrate over the prototype portal from advocacy.dfwpython.org to   advocacy.python.org.
 * Establish a subportal under advocacy.python.org for those who want to help promote Python.
 * Gain access to the correct portion of Python SVN to hold my creations, both software and content.
 * Make announcment re advocacy onto CLP and CLPA.

----
Existing Challenges:

 * Consider which versions of software to use on the site; there is some push to use Python 2.5 as well as the just-released Zope 3.3.0, except that Zope3 doesn't work with 2.5 without patches (and maybe more).  There are also version issues to resolve re psycopg1 vs psycopg v2, and which SVN revision of psycopgda to bridge between Zope3 and psycopg.  And last there is a question of which version of Nabu to use, the last release of Dec 2005 or a more recent snapshot from subversion.

 * Consider the correct directory and subversion layout to achieve separation of content from software written specifically for advocacy.

 * Consider whether to style the advocacy site exactly like www.python.org or to vary it either slightly (like us.pycon.org) or significantly.  A quiet look is good for those who come to a site frequently but something a bit louder can be useful to excite those who show up for the first time.  The louder site may tend to annoy those who must see it again and again.

----
Future Tasks:

 * Put out call for !PyCon talk and tutorial ideas; post my suggestion   list.
 * Ping pydotorg for site statistics, if they already exist.
 * Further restyling of us.pycon.org website
 * Install the python api for subversion, so I can directly manipulate repositories, as needed.
 * Figure out how to integrate Nabu with subversion, such that documents maintain an audit trail.
 * Finish processing the audio recordings from past !PyCons.
 * Encourage adoption of a standard presentation template for !PyCon.
 * For !PyCon:
    * rename Apache rewrite rule from "apps" to "apps06".
    * rename fastcgi start/stop scripts  to have "06" in them.
    * rename the django/pycon directory to django/pycon06
    * update the sudo config for the renamed files.
    * help Doug chg password for the pycon06 DB.
