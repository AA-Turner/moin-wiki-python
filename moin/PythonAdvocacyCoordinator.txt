In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire JeffreyRush for full-time work on [[Advocacy]].  The contract was renewed for another six months starting March 15, 2007, along with a [[http://www.python.org/psf/grants/advocacy/revised-tasks.pdf|list of tasks to tackle]].

Current Tasks:

 * Produce more "5-Minutes with Python" screencasts -- I've produced nine screencasts so far (not all 5-min though).
   * Python, Numbers and Array Processing
   * Python and Strings
   * Python and the Imaging Library
   * Python and Relational Databases
   * Python and Object Databases
   * Python and Scientific Computing
 * Work on "Starting and Running a Successful Python User Group" paper, with select members of the Usergroup Support Committee who have volunteered to help.
 * Hold another online meeting of the Usergroup Support Committee.

 * Use the [[http://www.dfwpython.org:8000/|www.python.org mockup area]] to test some proposed changes, re a "spotlight" topic and a "get involved" feature, and get feedback from the community.
 * Decide how to create a "spotlight" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.
 * Decide how to create a "get involved" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.

Existing Challenges (most recent at top):

 * crunching a talk down into only 5-minutes - it is surprisingly difficult
 * figuring out why threads I start re advocacy and usergroups die out, lacking persistence.
 * why no response pretty much at all to the repeated calls for podcasts and screencasts -- why is the community so averse to multimedia?
