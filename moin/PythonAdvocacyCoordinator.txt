In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire JeffreyRush for full-time work on ["Advocacy"].  The contract was renewed for another six months starting March 15, 2007, along with a [http://www.python.org/psf/grants/advocacy/revised-tasks.pdf list of tasks to tackle].

["AdvocacyAccomplishments"]

Current Tasks:

 * Use the [http://www.dfwpython.org:8000/ www.python.org mockup area] to test some proposed changes, re a "spotlight" topic and a "get involved" feature, and get feedback from the community.
 * Produce more "5-Minutes with Python" screencasts -- I've produced five so far.
   * Python, Numbers and Array Processing
   * Python and Strings
   * Python and the Imaging Library
   * Python and Relational Databases
   * Python and Object Databases
   * Python and Scientific Computing
 * Work on "Starting and Running a Successful Python User Group" paper, with select members of the Usergroup Support Committee who have volunteered to help.
 * Hold another online meeting of the Usergroup Support Committee.
 * Decide where to put reST/S5 slides on www.python.org and how to hook them into the build system so they are functional web slideshows.
 * Decide how to create a "spotlight" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.
 * Device how to create a "get involved" box on www.python.org, in consultation with the pydotorg group.
 * Begin reviewing 12th edition of "Understanding Computers" textbook. - deferred

Existing Challenges (most recent at top):

 * crunching a talk down into only 5-minutes - it is surprisingly difficult
 * figuring out why threads I start re advocacy and usergroups die out, lacking persistence.
 * why no response pretty much at all to the repeated calls for podcasts and screencasts -- why is the community so averse to multimedia?
