In mid-2006, the PSF agreed to hire JeffreyRush
for full-time work on ["Advocacy"].

["AdvocacyAccomplishments"]

My prototype of the advocacy site has been fully ported over the advocacy.python.org and checked into svn.python.org.  The site is up and down as I'm working on it, however I have established a clone of the site at advocacy.dfwpython.org.  The clone will be the development site and advocacy.python.org will be the production site, with a subversion check-in/check-out cycle used to catch the production site up with development.

I'm not happy with the colors and layout of the advocacy site but decided to put further tweaking aside and focus on getting all the pieces working so people have something to critique, and so we can start adding content to it.

----
Current Tasks:

 * Add support for filterable documents to the advocacy site, and come up with a decent presentation layout for said documents.
 * Establish a subportal under advocacy.python.org for those who want to help promote Python.
 * Make announcment re advocacy onto CLP and CLPA.

----
Existing Challenges:

 * Consider whether to style the advocacy site exactly like www.python.org or to vary it either slightly (like us.pycon.org) or significantly.  A quiet look is good for those who come to a site frequently but something a bit louder can be useful to excite those who show up for the first time.  The louder site may tend to annoy those who must see it again and again.

----
Future Tasks:

 * Ping pydotorg for site statistics, if they already exist.
 * Further restyling of us.pycon.org website
 * Install the python api for subversion, so I can directly manipulate repositories, as needed.
 * Figure out how to integrate Nabu with subversion, such that documents maintain an audit trail.
 * Finish processing the audio recordings from past !PyCons.
 * Encourage adoption of a standard presentation template for !PyCon.
 * For !PyCon:
    * rename Apache rewrite rule from "apps" to "apps06".
    * rename fastcgi start/stop scripts  to have "06" in them.
    * rename the django/pycon directory to django/pycon06
    * update the sudo config for the renamed files.
    * help Doug chg password for the pycon06 DB.
