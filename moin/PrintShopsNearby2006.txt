  This is not an exhaustive list.  If these shops don't suit you, post a note on the PyCon mailing list and I will get others added.  I looked for 5 Print Shops that were close to the Marriot Quorum, where PyCon 2006 is being held.

= Overall notes =
 * All the printers can create collated sets of handouts on normal american sized papers.  That means 8.5 x 11, 8.5 x 14 and 11 x 17.  I'll comment about other sizes available.  All printers listed can take paper copies to be duplicated, but I expect people will want to submit electronic copies to be duplicated.   Every printer expresses a strong preference for PDF files as the format to receive.  I'll comment about other formats that are accepted.
 * I asked them all about delivery times for  what I thought was a normal job.  The normal job is a printout to be used for tutorials and would be 50 copies of 40 to 100 pages each.  Bigger jobs may take longer, so ask if time is important.
 * I think any of these shops should be fine, but I do have editorial comments on a couple.  They are listed in the order I visited them, so don't read anything into the ordering.

== The Master's Press ==
 *  M-F 8:30AM - 5 PM
 *  (972) 387-0046
 *  (972) 404-0317 - fax
 *  aaron@themasterspress.com
 *  Takes payment by amex/MC/visa/discover
 *  Can take word/powerpoint files, but converts them to pdf before printing.
 *  Expect next day delivery for black and white copies
 *  Expect 2 days delivery for color copies.
 *  When arranging payment, they will fax you a credit form.  They want you to fill it in and sign it.  You can either fax it back or scan it and email the image to them.
 *  This would be my first choice of these shops.  I would expect a decent, but not the best price.  They seemed very professional and I looked at a few works in progress that looked first class.

== FedEx Kinko ==
 *  Open 24 hours/day, 7 days/week
 *  (972) 960-9449
 *  usa3112@fedexkinkos.com
 *  Takes payment by amex/MC/visa/discover/diners club
 *  They have a strong preference for receiving requests for information by phone.  Evidently, they are getting a lot of spam, and they just throw away a lot of email if it does not look like an order.  If you are outside the USA, please state that at the very top of the email as the reason you are sending email, instead of calling.

 *  ods00150cpc@officedepot.com
 *  4949 Beltline Rd, Dallas, TX 75240
 *  I have used them for printing, so don't take this too harshly, but they are less professional than any other print shop in the list.  The people there just basically run copy machines and I would not go to them with anything tricky.  They do stand behind their work and my copies were fine, but I would put this shop a step behind the others in the list.
