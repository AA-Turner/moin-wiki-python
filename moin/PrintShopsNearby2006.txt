  This is not an exhaustive list.  If these shops don't suit you, post a note on the PyCon mailing list and I will get others added.  I looked for 5 Print Shops that were close to the Marriot Quorum, where PyCon 2006 is being held.

= Overall notes =
  All the printers can create collated sets of handouts on normal american sized papers.  That means 8.5 x 11, 8.5 x 14 and 11 x 17.  I'll comment about other sizes available.  All printers listed can take paper copies to be duplicated, but I expect people will want to submit electronic copies to be duplicated.   Every printer expresses a strong preference for PDF files as the format to receive.  I'll comment about other formats that are accepted.
  I asked them all about delivery times for  what I thought was a normal job.  The normal job is a printout to be used for tutorials and would be 50 copies of 40 to 100 pages each.  Bigger jobs may take longer, so ask if time is important.
