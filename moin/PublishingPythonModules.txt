= Publishing Python Modules =

There are a couple of popular sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

 * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi|The Python Package Index]] (aka "PyPI" -- formerly known as the "Cheese Shop") is the current preferred location to list packages.  It is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python: you can upload distribution files to PyPI so that the code will be available for downloading.  See the CheeseShopTutorial or [[http://docs.python.org/dist/package-upload.html|Uploading Packages to the Package Index]] for more information.
 * [[http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/|The Python Cookbook]], for small useful snippets of code.

Your operating system distribution may have software collections. Searching for Python software can yield numerous packaged libraries and applications. For example:

 * [[http://packages.debian.org/stable/python/|Python packages in Debian stable]] (see also the [[http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages|Debian package search page]])
 * [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/|Python packages in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS]] (see also the [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu package search page]])

There are a few other less useful or older sites, in case you are searching for code and the above didn't help.

 * [[http://www.uselesspython.com/|Useless Python]] is indiscriminate, for all bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing. ''Now apparently inactive.''
 * [[http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py|Vaults of Parnassus]] - a link store for Python modules. You must host files elsewhere, but this is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code. ''Now apparently inactive.''
 * [[http://www.pycode.com/|PyCode]] - an older site where you could share modules.  ''No activity since 2006.''
 * This wiki - if a module is relatively short
