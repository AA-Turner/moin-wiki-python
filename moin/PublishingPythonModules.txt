= Publishing Python Code =

== Distributing projects ==

[[http://pypi.python.org/pypi|The Python Package Index]] (aka "PyPI" -- formerly known as the "Cheese Shop") is the preferred hub for publishing Python packages and modules. Python's [[StandardLibrary|standard library]] supports code uploads to PyPI through its distutils module.

See the [[CheeseShopTutorial|PyPI tutorial]] on this site or the official instructions on [[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html|Packaging and Distributing Projects]] published by the [[PythonPackagingAuthorities|Python Packaging Authorities]].

As an author of a project published on PyPI you may also be interested in these links:
 * [[http://pypi-ranking.info/alltime|PyPi Ranking]] lists projects on PyPI ranked by downloads, giving an indication of popularity.
 * [[http://pythonhackers.com/open-source|Top 400 Python Projects in Github]] is another list of popular projects/modules.

== Sharing code snippets ==

The [[http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/|Python section of the ActiveState Code Recipes]] is a popular place to publish small useful snippets of code.

Alternatively, you may add such snippets to this Wiki and link to them from the [[Code]] page.

Your operating system distribution may have software collections. Searching for Python software can yield numerous packaged libraries and applications. For example:

 * [[http://packages.debian.org/stable/python/|Python packages in Debian stable]] (see also the [[http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages|Debian package search page]])
 * [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/|Python packages in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS]] (see also the [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu package search page]])


== Outdated / inactive hosting sites for Python code ==

 * ''Useless Python'' was a site for indiscriminate publishing of all bits of Python code you didn't think were ''worth'' publishing. Now inactive and web address (`www.uselesspython.com`) used to place ads.
 * ''Vaults of Parnassus'' - a former link store for Python modules. You had to host files elsewhere, but this was one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code. Now non-existent.
 * ''!PyCode'' - an older site where you could share modules. Site (`www.pycode.com`) now used for unrelated blogging.
