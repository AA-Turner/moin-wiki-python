There are a couple of popular sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

 * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi The Python Package Index (aka "PyPI")] is the current preferred location to list packages.  It is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python: you can upload distribution files to PyPI so that the code will be available for downloading.  See the CheeseShopTutorial or [http://docs.python.org/dist/package-upload.html Uploading Packages to the Package Index] for more information.
 * [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/ The Python Cookbook], for small useful snippets of code.

There are a few other less useful or older sites, in case you are searching for code and the above didn't help.

 * [http://www.uselesspython.com/ Useless Python] is indiscriminate, for all bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing. 
 * [http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py Vaults of Parnassus] - a link store for Python modules. You must host files elsewhere, but this is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code.
 * [http://www.pycode.com/ PyCode] - an older site where you could share modules.  No activity since 2006.
 * This wiki - if a module is relatively short
