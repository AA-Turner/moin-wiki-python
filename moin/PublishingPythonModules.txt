There are various sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

 * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi Python Package Index (aka "PyPI")] - seems to be the current preferred location to list packages, and is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python.  You can upload distribution files to PyPI so that the code will be available for downloading. See the CheeseShopTutorial for more information.
 * [http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py Vaults of Parnassus] - a link store for Python modules. You must host files elsewhere, but this is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code.
 * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/ Python Cookbook], hosted by ActiveState, for small useful bits.  Code submitted there is reviewed, and takes a while to appear on the site, if submitted by e-mail. Code submitted directly through a web form appears immediately.
 * [http://www.uselesspython.com/ Useless Python] is indiscriminate, for all bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing. 
 * [http://www.pycode.com/ PyCode] - a new site that allows you to upload modules.
 * This wiki - if a module is relatively short

Where is the PyCode site? Canceled? If so, it's a pitty. It was such a good idea to have a place to upload software.

'Note that packages can be uploaded to PyPI. -- amk

I haven't found a way to upload anything but a PKG-INFO file to PyPI. What kind of magic is needed for that? Anyway, if someone ''knows'' what has happened to the Py``Code site, and whether it will re-appear or it is cancelled, then please tell us.

B) After several days of inaccessiblity, the Py``Code site has just re-appeared. I have removed the comments near the reference above.

See the CheeseShopTutorial for information on using PyPI to upload distribution files.

I've cleaned the page up a bit. I took out the repetition of PyPI (listed twice), and [http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/index.phtml/fid/199/ faqts], since I didn't see that it was a "place to publish modules." I did reference it in the "See also's," since it did have relevant information.

Personally, I'de prefer not to have a page called "How to publish Python modules." It doesn't exactly lend itself to becomming [http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/LinkLanguage LinkLanguage.] I'd rather call the page: "PublishingPythonModules", or "PublishPythonModules", or even just a section of "PythonModules".

["lwickjr"]: "[PublishingPythonModules]" it is.
