The list is ordered with a preference to number of downloads per month, followed by the number of subscribers to the project mailing list.

The list is under construction. Suggestion on formatting, help finding more projects and keeping data up-to-date is welcome.

In order to keep the list focused, some metrics have to be established so that every Python-related project isn't in the list. For example, a minimum of three thousand (3K) downloads per month, a few hundred subscribers to the project mailing list, or an obviously large established user base (e.g. Mailman). In addition, the list doesn't include modules or packages in the standard libraries such as Tkinter.

Download figures will vary for a project as new releases are made. Perhaps the download figures below should be an average of the last full three or four previous months? You can see detailed monthly downloads by following the links below for projects hosted on SourceForge.

The download figures were last updated in March 2004. -- KevinAltis

== Additional notes ==
 * Mac OS X includes Python - Jaguar used Python 2.2.0, Panther uses Python 2.3.0
 * RedHat and Debian Linux distributions include Python and RedHat uses Python extensively and some Python projects are also included with the distributions.
 * Due to bundling and the use of mirror sites we can't collect meaningful download totals for Linux users for many projects. In those cases, maybe it is better to use the size of the mailing list as a popularity gauge?
