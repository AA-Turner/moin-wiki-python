Suggestions for 2009
====================

This page should be used as a place to capture the ideas that we don't want to forget to incorporate in 2009 given our fresh perspectives on 2008... so.... list away!  (also, feel free to add topics/sections, the list below was just a quick start...

*************

Financial Aid
-------------

* Make reimbursement process easier by creating a pdf for recipients to fill out instead of making them create their own.

Food, etc.
----------

* Have water be available in the hallways, not just the rooms
* Convince the food vendors / hotel to leave the food trays around for longer than the few minutes when scheduled meal breaks are.  Numerous times I missed the provided food due to an extended conversation following a talk or having been in the vendor area.


Lightning Talks
---------------


Networking
----------

* wired network for speakers' podiums, vendors & sponsors who request it, tutorials (esp. tutorial instructors)
* wired network for tutorials -- too many people need to install at the beginning of a tutorial and it was too easy for the wireless to go down thus holding up progress on tutorials.


Open Space
----------

* introduction to open space for attendees
* more announcements about open spaces

  * each session chair mentions open spaces that they're interested in
  * add scheduled open spaces to the daily schedule changes sheet

Sponsorship
-----------



Talk Selection Process
----------------------


Talk Logistics
--------------

* Better wrangling of speakers at speaking time
* Headset mics to free up both hands?
* Buffer zone around A/V setup to avoid RFI from Blackberrys and such
* Email in advance and/or give a handout to all presenters (including lightening talkers) to include:

   * suggestion to turn off screensavers, IM clients, etc that might interupt the talk
   * warnings against poorly contrasting colors (e.g. yellow on green)
   * supported projector resolutions
   * recommended minimum font size for legibility at various resolutions
   * suggestion to backup their presentation prior to the day of their talk :-)

* A spare DVI to VGA adapter per room
* Perhaps a spare projector in the speaker's ready room which can be used to test the speaker's equipment out prior to their talk
