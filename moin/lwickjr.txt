Attention, please: I am interested in the possibility of de-linting some of the documentation. How do I go about signing up?

FredDrake sez:  See the [[http://www.python.org/dev/doc/|Documentation Development]] page.

[[lwickjr]] <<DateTime>>: Done, which I noted on your page some time ago. :) [I find myself wondering if anyone found the delinted pages.]

[[lwickjr]] <<DateTime>>: LionKimbro: "Parnassus". ;)

Welcome to my page.

After reading Wiki:RealNamesPlease, Wiki:RealNamesPleaseDiscussion, and Wiki:OneNamePlease,

I respectfully decline to change my login ID.

This is the ID I use exclusively online, it is derived from my "RL" name, and it is the ID under which I receive my e-mail.

In accordance with Wiki:OneNamePlease and Wiki:RealNamesPleaseDiscussion, I conclude that while "lwickjr" is not "exactly" in accordance with Wiki:RealNamesPlease, it IS "close enough".

Please, no flames; no offense intended.

If anyone with GOOD American-English spelling skills would care to proofread this page and correct any spelling errors that I can't find, feel free. I've been adding known-correctly-spelled words to the online spelling checker, but I'm a tad unsure of a few of my spellings.
----
I have a few questions that I've been unable to find answer for.

All the documentation I've seen seems to assume that someone wanting to publish Python modules has -- and knows how to use -- a 24/7 file server available to use.

This is not always the case.

Further, I have found the documentation on distributing Python modules to be strong on the mechanics of how to PACKAGE modules [somewhat over-kill, I think, for simple drop-in single-file modules], and nearly nonexistent on how to PUBLISH them.

Could someone __please__ write a page on PublishingPythonModules that is understandable by someone with significant *computer* experience but minimal *Internet* experience?

Hi lwick, before I answer some of your questions, I'd like you to consider Wiki:RealNamesPlease. It is one of our WikiGuidelines, and it has worked well for us so far.

I'm not completely sure what you mean by publishing Python modules. If you need a space to upload your Python modules, you might want to consider StarshipPython. It used to be free for PSA members, but the PSA has ceased to exist, so I guess a small donation to the PythonSoftwareFoundation will do now. Would that solve your problem?

-- JohannesGijsbers

[[lwickjr]]: Possibly. I've written a few useful-to-me modules that I think others might also find useful. I'd like to share them, but I am NOT on-line 24/7, and would like someone to host them for downloading. As for [[WikiName]]s, would LWickJr do? If so, how do I change it?

With a real name I meant the one in your passport, not capitalizing your nick into a WikiName. Changing it is easy: just create the new page and cut all content from this page into it. Then delete this page and log in using your new name. -- JohannesGijsbers

[[lwickjr]]: Don't have a passport. As for my "nick", the L is my first initial, the Wick is my family name, and the Jr is because I've got the same name as my father. Isn't this "real" enough?

 /--- later the same day ---

  Having read Wiki:RealNamesPlease, Wiki:RealNamesPleaseDiscussion, and Wiki:OneNamePlease, I choose to continue using [[lwickjr]] as my login name. It is a persistent on-line identity. It is directly related to my given name. It is the *only* ID I use online. I doubt that anyone here would like to call me "the Hungry Hacker", with which I sign all my e-mail.

  Having stated my position, I simply shall ignore the issue and contribute as best I can. After all, isn't that why we're here?

  No offense taken; none intended.

BTW, what do you think of the modules I describe [[/Modules| here]]?

As for publishing modules, it seems to me that we in the Python community are not yet [[http://rubyforge.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php|as organized as the Ruby community.]]

For the most part, people set up their own website, maybe something on SourceForge, get a listing on PyPi or the vaults (of what-I-cant-spell,) and mention it on the python-announce usenet forum.

It would be a good subject for a new wiki page. I think there's already one that's started somewhere, that it would be worthwhile to revisit.

-- LionKimbro <<DateTime(2005-04-01T21:16:29Z)>>

[[lwickjr]]: Um, sorry about that. The descriptions are heavy on *what* the modules do, but totally void of either of how they work or why one would want to use them.

As for that WIKIPage you mention, [[PublishingPythonModules| How to publish Python modules]], I created it in hopes that someone would populate it with useful information. I'm thinking of doing just that. Ok, people, just how big is "small enough"?

Sombody else (Who?): You`re right, it *is* worth revisiting, in case someone _has_ done just that. Someone suggested that small modules can be posted here.

[[lwickjr]]: Yes; I've seen that.

[[lwickjr]]: Please note: "[[PublishingPythonModules| How to publish Python modules]]" has been superceeded by PublishingPythonModules.

I'm uploading some of my more publishable modules as attachments to [[/Modules| this page]]. "Alias" is in [[attachment:lwickjr/Modules/Alias.py|lwickjr/Modules:Alias.py]], "Edit" is in [[attachment:lwickjr/Modules/Edit.py|lwickjr/Modules:Edit.py]], and "UT" is in [[attachment:lwickjr/Modules/UT.py|lwickjr/Modules:UT.py]] - I *hope* they're not to big.

Does Edit interest you? Don't forget: it *does* require that the default subprocess be turned off, as it REQUIRES interaction between the user dataspace and the I.D.L.E. dataspace, and I don`t [currently] know how to use the IPC [Inter-Process Communication] that I.D.L.E. uses for the purpose. Alias has the same requirement, and for the same reason.
