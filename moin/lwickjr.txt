Welcome to my page.

I have a few questions that I've been unable to find answer for.

All the documentation I've seen seems to assume that someone wanting to publish Python modules has -- and knows how to use -- a 24/7 file server available to use.

This is not always the case.

Further, I have found the documentation on distributing Python modules to be strong on the mechanicals of how to PACKAGE modules [somewhat over-kill, I think, for simple drop-in single-file modules], and nearly non-existant on how to PUBLISH them.

Could someone __please__ write a page on ["How to publish Python modules"] that is understandable by someone with significant *computer* experience but minimal *internet* experience?

Hi Iwick, before I answer some of your questions, I'd like you to consider Wiki:RealNamesPlease. It is one of our WikiGuidelines, and it has worked well for us so far.

I'm not completely sure what you mean by publishing Python modules. If you need a space to upload your Python modules, you might want to consider StarshipPython. It used to be free for PSA members, but the PSA has ceased to exist, so I guess a small donation to the PythonSoftwareFoundation will do now. Would that solve your problem?

["lwickjr"]: Possibly. I've written a few useful-to-me modules that I think others might also find useful. I'd like to share them, but I am NOT on-line 24/7, and would like someone to host them for downloading. As for WikiNames, would LWickJr do? If so, how do I change it?

My more-interesting modules [by the way, how do I link to a Wiki page with text that doesn't match the destination page's name?] include "Alias", "Edit", and "UT". I'll add others to this page as I have opportunity [the machine I'm typing this on isn't my home system].

General outlines:

 * Alias
   * Provides a mechanism whereby arbitrary callables are *effectively* converted to commands in interactive Python, but not in modules.
