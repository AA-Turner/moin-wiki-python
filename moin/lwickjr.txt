Welcome to my page.

I have a few questions that I've been unable to find answer for.

All the documentation I've seen seems to assume that someone wanting to publish Python modules has -- and knows how to use -- a 24/7 file server available to use.

This is not always the case.

Further, I have found the documentation on distributing Python modules to be strong on the mechanicals of how to PACKAGE modules [somewhat over-kill, I think, for simple drop-in single-file modules], and nearly non-existant on how to PUBLISH them.

Could someone __please__ write a page on ["How to publish Python modules"] that is understandable by someone with significant *computer* experiance but minimal *internet* experiance?
