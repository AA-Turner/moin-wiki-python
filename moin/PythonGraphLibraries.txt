= Python Graph Libraries =

These libraries are concerned with graphs and networks, not the plotting of numeric data in graphical form.

From the [[PythonGraphApi|Python Graph API]] page, plus some others discovered through searching the Internet, quoting the descriptions for each package:

 * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/apgl/|Another Python Graph Library]] is a simple, fast and easy to use graph library with some machine learning features.
   * Apparently requires the [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MLPY/|MLPY]] package, and thus the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/|GNU Scientific Library (GSL)]] and [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/|NumPy]], [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/|SciPy]] and all its dependencies
 * [[http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/|igraph]] is a free software package for creating and manipulating undirected and directed graphs. It includes implementations for classic graph theory problems like minimum spanning trees and network flow, and also implements algorithms for some recent network analysis methods, like community structure search.
   * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-igraph|python-igraph]] is the set of Python bindings
 * [[http://networkx.lanl.gov/|NetworkX]] is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
 * [[http://compbio.washington.edu/~zach/py_graph/doc/html/public/py_graph-module.html|py_graph]] is a native python library for working with graphs.
 * [[http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/|python-graph]] is a library for working with graphs in Python. This software provides ï»¿a suitable data structure for representing graphs and a whole set of important algorithms.
