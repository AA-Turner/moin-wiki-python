'''NOTE:''' we've switched to a new branch.  The old py3k-struni branch is dead, and so is the misnamed p3yk branch.  If you have either one checked out, ''don't update'', but issue this command (slightly different if you have an anonymous checkout):
{{{
svn switch svn+ssh://pythondev@svn.python.org/python/branches/py3k
}}}
'''Don't check anything in to the obsolete p3yk or py3k-struni branches!'''
