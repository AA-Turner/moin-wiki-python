IT industry, this SIG can provide a place to discuss challenges and
hopefully foster knowledge sharing and tools development. Relevant
topics include tools for working with healthcare standard data
formats, industry news items, professional development, and success
stories about Python and open source in the healthcare industry. Along
the way, this SIG page can be updated with links to relevant projects
and resources.
