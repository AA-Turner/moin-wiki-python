= What's Python 3.0/Python 3000? =

Python 3.0 (a.k.a. "Python 3000" or "Py3k") is a new version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed. The standard library has also been reorganized in a few prominent places.

The aim of Python 3.0 is to clean up the language by removing little-used
features and changing functionality 

= What changed in Python 3.0? =

Read [[http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html|What's New in Python 3.0]], 
which lists the changes between Python 2.6 and Python 3.0.

= What will happen to the Python 2.x versions? =

There will be at least one more 2.x release, Python 2.7, and a 2.8 release cannot be ruled out.

As users attempt to port packages to 3.x, they will surely
report bugs in the compatibility and conversion tools, and Python 2.7 will 
incorporate the results of this feedback.
As a result, new warnings will be added to the 3.0-compatibility mode, and  
new fixers will be added to the `2to3` conversion tool.

Python 2.7 will also incorporate language changes from the Python 3.x series, 
as far as this is possible while remaining compatible with the existing body of 
2.x code.

2.7 will probably include some new features and/or modules.  Whatever these new features might be,
they will certainly also be present in Python 3.1.

= How should I port existing Python code to Python 3.0? =

Python 2.6 and 3.0 include a tool called 2to3
that parses Python 2.x code and rewrites it to work in Python 3.0.
2to3 includes a large set of ''fixers'', each one updating a particular language feature.

We suggest the following steps for porting a package to 3.0:

* Have a test suite that exercises significant portions of 
your library or application's functionality, the more the better.

* Run the test suite using Python 2.6 and specifying the `-3` switch, which enables warnings about code that's incompatible with Python 3.0.  Modify the code to avoid triggering the warnings.

* Run the `2to3` script over the code.  If `2to3` can't perform the conversion due to code constructs that can't be automatically translated, modify your 2.x code to use 3.0-compatible 
features.

* Once `2to3` can convert your code without complaint, try running the test suite using the 3.0-transformed version.  Examine any test failures and modify the 2.x code responsible to be 3.0-compatible until the test suite succeeds using the transformed version.


Consult [[http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html|the 2to3 documentation]] for more information.

One approach to distributing your 3.0 package is to use 3.0's build_py_2to3 implementation of
the build_py command. See `Demo/distutils/test2to3` for an example.

You will have a single lib.py, written in 2.x. When you install
in 3.0, lib2to3 will convert it to 3.x in the build area, and
then install the 3.0 version.

That, of course, requires you to adjust lib.py in such a way that
2to3 will successfully and completely convert it. 
In two experiments, Martin von Loewis
ported Django  and Mark Hammond ported PythonWin to 3.0, 
and found that these adjustments were quite feasible.
You look at what 2to3
does, find out what additional modifications need to be done, and
apply them to the input of 2to3 so that

* 2to3 leaves these changes in place
* they either have no effect or still work correctly when run in 2.x.

[[http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=227041|In this weblog posting]],
Guido van Rossum strongly suggests not changing 
your APIs when porting to 3.0, because API changes will 
make it difficult for users to tell whether test suite failures 
are due to the 2.6->3.0 transition or to the API changes.

= How should I port existing C extensions to Python 3.0? =

Benjamin Peterson's [[http://docs.python.org/howto/cporting.html|Porting Extension Modules to 3.0]] describes
some of the changes to Python's C API, and gives some tips for writing
code that will compile with both 2.x and 3.0.
