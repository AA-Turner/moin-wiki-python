Next episode: episode #11.

== Specific topics ==


Another suggested implementation of the GIL - and a legitimate reason for Brett to say F*ck during an episode:
http://bugs.python.org/issue7946
* LWN article on Con Kolivas' linux-kernel scheduler that inspires this patch. http://lwn.net/Articles/350100/
* FAQ on the Linux BFS scheduler http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/bfs/bfs-faq.txt

*More* new changes in unittest (addition of -c / -f command line options). New unittest2 release that contains these - 0.3.0. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

The futures api, PEP 3148: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148/

Google summer of code approaching again. (Applicants and mentors needed I believe?)

New Python podcast just starting: http://www.unquietdesperation.com/2010/03/24/from-python-import-podcast/

The change from using .pyc files to the __pycache__ directory is  interesting and will happen in Python 3.2. http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/

Before the last podcast Steve raised the issue of how people become Python committers and how good (or otherwise) the core team are at handling bug reports and patches on the tracker. We could discuss that in the CPython segment.

In the IronPython world the signal module just got implemented, although it will probably be in 2.7 not the forthcoming 2.6.1 (which has a big Unicode compatibility improvement plus perf and startup time improvements).
