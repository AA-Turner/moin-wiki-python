== Topics for #13 ==

[[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/|New PEP: 3147]]: PYC repository directories
* will happen in Python 3.2 (code already committed)
* makes it easier to share Python code among multiple versions/implementations.
* instead of writing out a .pyc/.pyo in the same directory as the .py, will write to a __pycache__ directory.
* will ignore .pyc if no .py exists

Short items:

2.7beta1 released
* What's New not completely updated.

New PSF board?

GHOP selection process now underway.
* program aimed at college-level students
* through which they can learn how to work on open-source projects.
* students write proposals describing what they want to work on.
* students work w/ mentors, who are existing developers.
* students are paid roughly $3-4K, so this replaces a summer job.

== Specific topics ==

*More* new changes in unittest (addition of -c / -f command line options). New unittest2 release that contains these - 0.3.0. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

Before the last podcast Steve raised the issue of how people become Python committers and how good (or otherwise) the core team are at handling bug reports and patches on the tracker. We could discuss that in the CPython segment.
