rev80724: py3k changes for Thread Sanitizer

== Topics for #13 ==

**recorded; needs to be edited**

PSF stuff:
 * new board
 * funding
 * include Tim Couper discussion in here?

[[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/|New PEP: 3147]]: PYC repository directories
 * will happen in Python 3.2 (code already committed)
 * makes it easier to share Python code among multiple versions/implementations.
 * instead of writing out a .pyc/.pyo in the same directory as the .py, will write to a __pycache__ directory.
 * will ignore .pyc if no .py exists

Short items:

2.7beta1 released
 * What's New not completely updated.

GSOC (Summer of Code) selection process now underway.
 * program aimed at college-level students
 * through which they can learn how to work on open-source projects.
 * students write proposals describing what they want to work on.
 * students work w/ mentors, who are existing developers.
 * students are paid roughly $3-4K, so this replaces a summer job.

[[http://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/the-sec-and-the-python/|SEC to mandate use of Python]] for expressing algorithms?
 * SEC = US Securities & Exchange Commission
 * Mission is "to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."
 * Draft rules for asset-backed securities state:

     In addition, we are proposing to require, along with the prospectus filing, the filing of a computer program of the contractual cash flow provisions expressed as downloadable source code in Python, a commonly used open source interpretive programming language.  

 * ABSes would have to post their assets as XML, and the Python program would read and analyze it to produce the resulting cashflow.

 * Motivation is: "We believe that, with the waterfall computer program and the asset data file, investors would be better able to conduct their own evaluations of ABS and may be less likely to be dependent on the opinions of credit rating agencies."

 * Requests for comments: is Python the right language?  Other languages that should be used?  Closed-source languages OK?


== Specific topics ==

*More* new changes in unittest (addition of -c / -f command line options). New unittest2 release that contains these - 0.3.0. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

Before the last podcast Steve raised the issue of how people become Python committers and how good (or otherwise) the core team are at handling bug reports and patches on the tracker. We could discuss that in the CPython segment.
