=== PyCon user's guide ===

* have learning objectives.  Think about what would make your job or  personal programming better.

* plan out your schedule at http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/

* try to sit up close so you have a better view of the slides and the presenter.

* pay attention to the presenter; don't just sit on IRC or do e-mail (you could have stayed home and done that!).

* go to open space.  Informal sessions; a great opportunity to talk to the developer of an app you use, or meet other users.

* Talk to people.  Strike up conversations with people at lunch /   between talks.

* figure out who you would like to meet.

* remember that this is a professional venue -- don't go completely wild  in the bar.

* bring business cards (or resumes if you're job-hunting).

* Collect business cards; be sure to write notes on the back.
