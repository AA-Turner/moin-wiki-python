== Mats Wichmann ==

Long time mostly-under-the-radar Python guy. I wrote a Python training course back around 2000, acted as tech editor on a well-known Python text, had my own book in development (though the project canceled before publication), then work took me mostly in other directions for many years.  These days I help out on the tutor mailing list, Python webmaster, and anyplace else people ask for help, trying to give back to the community. 

Very occasionally, I also [[http://writebetterpython.blogspot.com/|blog a bit]] about Python topics. 

If I'm not tied up with other things, I'm available for Python consulting and training engagements.
