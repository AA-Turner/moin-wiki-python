I'm pretty busy during the summer, so '''if you have a question about GSoC, there may be a mailing list you should contact to get the fastest possible answer.''' See below for which list you should email and when:


'''GSoC Students'''

For most questions regarding GSoC projects, you should be asking the developers for that specific project.  

There is a list of project here:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013

Each one has a mailing list and sometimes an IRC channel associated with it. That is where you should be introducing yourself and asking questions.

If you are not sure who to contact for any reason, you should be asking on the soc2013-general mailing list. You can subscribe to this here:
http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2013-general/

The only time you should contact me personally rather than using the mailing list or talking to your mentors is if you have a problem with your mentor or other question that you need to keep private.

'''GSoC Mentors'''

If you are subscribed to the mentors' mailing list already, ask there (we have lots of experienced mentors who can help you out!).  

If you're not subscribed yet but would like to be, or have a question that you want to keep more private (e.g. about a troublesome student), email me directly.
