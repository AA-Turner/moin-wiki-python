Please add a listing to this page if you're working on Distutils (and help us reduce duplication of effort).

'''Cheese Shop / PyPI''' -- the central repository of python package metadata and distribution files.

'''Python Eggs''' -- an effort to produce single-file distributions of packages similar to Java JARs. See http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs

'''PEPs for extending distutils / PyPI''' -- PEPs 262 "Database of Installed Python Packages" and 345  "Metadata for Python Software Packages 1.2" are currently open

'''Uraga''' -- an effort to develop a tool for download and installation of packages. See http://www.byteofpython.info/projects/uraga/uraga.html


Other efforts we know about:

Ian Bicking is looking to clean up and extend the use of release_urls in PyPI.

Maurice Ling is looking at implementing PEP 262 as an academic project.
