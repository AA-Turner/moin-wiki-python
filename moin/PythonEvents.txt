= Python Events in the World =
The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring around the world or online. We're especially interested in listing conferences where Python will be taught or where Python BOFs will be held.

If you have contributions for this page, please edit the page to add them. Please include dates of the event, contact information, and a URL that people can follow for more information. Try to add the appropriate colour from the [[#Legend|legend]].

Other event listings:

 * The [[http://pycon.org#calendar|Python Event Calendar]] on pycon.org and in the python.org website shows dates of upcoming conference and user group events. This is administered by a group of volunteers. Please see the PythonEventsCalendar wiki page for details on how to get events listed.

 * [[http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=Python|TechVenue.com]] has a more comprehensive calendar of Python events that includes regularly scheduled user-group meetings.

 * [[http://con-techie.com/|Con-Techie]] is a directory listing events related to open-source software (but appears defunct as of 2011-05-18).

See the [[PythonConferences|Python Conferences]] page for a general overview of the different Python conferences, but feel free to put exact conference dates in the calendar below.

If you want to set up your own training event, refer to the [[PythonTraining|Python Training]] page on this site or [[CameronLaird|Cameron Laird's]] page of [[http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_training.html|Python trainers]]. If you want to organize a conference or event in your city or community, read [[AdvocacyWritingTasks/RunningAConference|our guide to running a conference]] for helpful advice.

Also see the [[LocalUserGroups|local user groups]] list for recurring local events.
