= Python Events in the World =

The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring around the world or online.

== Event Listings ==

 * For conference and user group events, please see the PythonEventsCalendar page for details. The calendars are available on the python.org website as:

  * [[https://www.python.org/events/python-events/|Python Conferences Events Calendar]]
  * [[https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/|Python User Group Events Calendar]]

 or combined as:

  * [[https://www.python.org/events/|Python Events Calendar]]

 The calendars are maintained by a group of volunteers. If you want to submit conference and user group events, please see the [[PythonEventsCalendar#Submitting_an_Event|submission section]] of the project page.

 In recent years, the events calendars have grown to be a standard resource for people trying to find Python community related events, so we'd like to encourage your submission to those calendars.

 * If you are looking for training events in upcoming months, please see the [[PythonTraining/Events]] page.

 * [[http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=Python|TechVenue.com]] has another calendar of Python events that includes regularly scheduled user-group meetings.

Since the calendar on this page was only showing training events in recent months, we have moved those event listings to a new [[PythonTraining/Events]] page.
