= Python Events =

The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring around the world or online.  We're especially interested in listing conferences where Python will be taught or where Python BOFs will be held.

If you have contributions for this page, please edit the page to add them.
Please include dates of the event, contact information, and a URL that people can follow for more information.

[[http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=Python|TechVenue.com]] has a more comprehensive calendar of Python events that includes regularly scheduled user-group meetings.

See the PythonConferences page for a general overview of the different Python conferences, but feel free to put exact conference dates in the calendar below.
