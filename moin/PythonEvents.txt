= Python Events =

The following is a list of Python related events that are occurring
around the world.  We're especially interested in listing conferences
where Python will be taught or where Python BOFs will be held, local
user group meetings, etc.  If you have contributions for this page
please edit the page to add them.

Please include dates of the event, contact information, and a URL that
people can follow for more information.

Material about past conferences is linked from http://www.python.org/workshops/. See the PythonConferences page for a general overview of the different Python conferences, but feel free to put exact conference dates in the calendar below.

If you want to set up your own training event, refer to the PythonTraining page on this site or CameronLaird's page of [http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/python_training.html Python trainers].

Also see the LocalUserGroups list for recurring local events.
