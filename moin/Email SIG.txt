= The email package SIG =

The [[http://www.python.org/doc/current/library/email.html|email package]] is a large, complicated package that comes with Python, and which supports parsing, manipulating and generating email messages in RFC compliant formats.  Its development is ongoing.  Current focus is on version 6.0, with a target release in Python 3.1 (back ported to Python 2.7), and with standalone packages available to older versions of Python.

The information and pages below are used to record decisions and status related to the email package's development.  Discussions should be conducted on the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/email-sig|Email SIG mailing list]] [[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/email-sig/|(archive)]].

== Goals ==

== Schedule and Status ==

Ideally, email 6.0 would be ready for Python 3.1 [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0375/|(release schedule)]].  In order to be ready for Python 3.1, we would need to be feature complete by the first scheduled beta on May 2, 2009.  If we can't be ready by then, we'll target Python 3.2 which will likely be 18-24 months after Python 3.1 (so, something like beginning of 2011).  In all cases, we'll provide standalone packages via the [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi|(cheeseshop)]] for all older versions, include Python 2.x at least back to Python 2.5.
