= Sandboxed Python =

Is there such a thing as "Sandboxed Python"? Something where you can run a Python that is limited in what it can do. (See also ["How can I run an untrusted Python script safely (i.e. Sandbox)"] from the AskingForHelp page.)

You could do all ''sorts'' of cool things with a sandboxed Python:

  * You could turn a wiki into an RAD development platform. You just draw up your interface with Wiki:WikiSyntax, write up a little bit of Python code, and bam- instant application. :)
    * This is presumably similar to [http://www.tiddlywiki.com/ TiddlyWiki] - a JavaScript-based Wiki which behaves like a Web-based sandboxed application. -- PaulBoddie
  * You could make a distributed code system, where not just resources, but functionality as well, can distribute safely over multiple computers.

A "Sandboxed Python" would let you permit or forbid modules, limit execution slices, permit or deny network traffic, constrain filesystem access to a particular directory (floated as "/"), and so on.

You're referring to [http://docs.python.org/lib/restricted.html RestrictedExecution], right?

This was brought up recently by Mitch Kapor at PyCon and noted on his [http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000559.html#000559 blog].

Prior to Python 2.3, there were two modules, rexec and Bastion which were attempted to provide a sandboxed environment. Unfortunately there were known bugs and work-arounds in these modules, and the introduction of new-style classes in Python 2.3 simply made matters worse. Rather than provide a false sense of security, the modules were removed in Python 2.3.

There are a number of people who are interested in creating a new sandboxing system for Python. Zope provides a system which many believe is secure ([http://svn.zope.org/RestrictedPython/ RestrictedPython]), but is only permits a very restricted subset of Python. Another related work is [http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxProxy.html mxProxy].

For my part, I think this is something that the PSF should fund development on so that it happens sooner rather than later. There are enough interested parties, that lends itself to getting government or other grant funding. -- KevinAltis

Having used the rexec stuff years ago (1995-6), I seem to recall that the principles of that module involved restricting the modules available, possibly along with the attributes available from each module, class and object. Is there a concise summary of how such mechanisms could have been subverted/exploited and a description of why they are particularly hard to fix? Or is that what this page is about? -- PaulBoddie

I think it should be what the page is about. The basic problem is that Python's introspection allows several ways to "escape". For instance, code which is passed a file object, f, are given access to that single file, but it ALSO can use "type(f)", or "f.__class__" to get access to "file" itself, and then use it to open any file. Security experts will tell you that "plugging holes" is generally a poor approach to security because there usually turn out to be additional "holes" you hadn't considered -- true security requires an overall design with security considerations included. Doing this for Python is not impossible, but may prove difficult. On the other hand, I would agree that it is worthwhile. -- MichaelChermside

I also have another idea... I have long thought that much of the issues could be handled by creating a module which would make it easy to run bits of Python code in a ''separate'' interpreter, running as a separate process, and sandboxed using OS features. The difficulty would be that such a module would require OS-specific code... but it would have the potential to provide sandboxing that was as reliable as the OS would allow. -- MichaelChermside

Sounds like Parrot, (PythonAndParrot,) to me. -- LionKimbro

How so? -- MichaelChermside

Oh, sorry. No, Parrot doesn't refer to running bits of Python code in a seperate interpreter.

Parrot seems like a good target for running the sandboxed code in. I mean: ".NET" and all. Make it so you can secure the Parrot interpreter, and you're good. If a module requires custom C code links, or whatever, make it so you can close the gates to individual parts of C code, or something. And then make it so you can put various RestrictedExecution thingies on the Python code. -- LionKimbro

Perhaps a better solution with the same approach would be ["Jython"]. Java provides excellent sandboxing capabilities, and ["Jython"] has the distinct advantage that it ''already exists and works''. -- MichaelChermside

 * As does [http://boo.codehaus.org/ boo], which runs on the .NET and Mono runtimes, which also have excellent sandboxing capabilities (I do not claim that they are any better than java, however).  See [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=264462 this thread] (you would have to convert the C# example posted by Viz''''''One to boo.  There is a C# to boo converter in the boo add-in for the free Sharp''''''Develop IDE).


If there is a way to get Java running on Linux, I can't figure it out. I installed J2SE, the massive beast, as Sun recommends, ''once.'' It was a nightmare of a procedure. I had an easier time installing Oracle. After running the VM, my computer barely functioned.

Perhaps I've downloaded the wrong thing, right? But Sun doesn't make it easy. They push J2SE everywhere. "Oh, before you can download this, you need to download J2SE." Well, J2SE is immensly complicated. I've given up on running Java from Linux.

If you have any special clues for me, they'd be greatly appreciated.

Whereas Parrot; I think Parrot will function just fine. It'll just take a little time. -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2004-05-07T16:54:04Z)]]

You downloaded the "right thing".  Sun's implementation of Java is huge, and so are the memory requirements -- which may be why your Linux box bogged down.  So that's my special clue: buy more memory, or try IBM's VM.  Or forget about Java as a sort of evolutionary dead end.
