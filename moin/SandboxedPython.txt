Is there such a thing as "Sandboxed Python"..?

Something where you can run a Python that is limited in what it can do.

You could do all ''sorts'' of cool things with a sandboxed Python:

  * You could turn a wiki into an RAD development platform. You just draw up your interface with Wiki:WikiSyntax, write up a little bit of Python code, and bam- instant application. :)
  * You could make a distributed code system, where not just resources, but functionality as well, can distribute safely over multiple computers.

A "Sandboxed Python" would let you permit or forbid modules, limit execution slices, permit or deny network traffic, constrain filesystem access to a particular directory (floated as "/"), etc., etc.,.
