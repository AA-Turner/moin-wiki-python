Let's try to record a monthly round-table podcast that discusses Python-related events and news.

The [[http://wikipediaweekly.org/|Wikipedia Weekly]] podcast is a good model for us.  Try listening to episode 80 or 81, which are daily wrap-ups from the Wikimania 2009 conference, or episode 78, which is a Skype-recorded episode.

Let's aim for 1/2 an hour to an hour.  (Wikipedia Weekly will sometimes be 1.5 hours, but that seems too long; a bit more editing can make the discussion go faster.)

= Scheduling time =

AMK is available weekends (pretty much any time), and weeknights 7PM-10PM US Eastern (23:00-2:00 UTC).

Brett is available weekends (11:00 Pacific and later), and weeknights typically 19:00 - 23:00 Pacific. Tuesday/Thursday starting at 17:30 Pacific (although Thursday is better). Other days may be negotiable.

= Technical =

Wikipedia Weekly seems to record the audio from one single participant.  This means that the audio quality for a remote speaker will occasionally become bad or they'll drop out.
It would be better, though more effort, if *everyone* recorded their audio and sent to it to an editor.  That way everyone is represented by a high-quality local recording.

= Workflow =

1. Write an agenda/list of topics and distribute it to all the participants so they can read up on stuff (or not -- up to the participant).

2. Hold a Skype conference call between all the participants.  Each participant tries to record their own audio.

3. Everyone sends their audio to an editor who combines the best of each recording into a single track and edits out glitches and other errors.

4. Post the audio.
