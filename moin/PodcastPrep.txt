= Format =

Let's try to record a monthly round-table podcast that discusses Python-related events and news.

The [[http://wikipediaweekly.org/|Wikipedia Weekly]] podcast is a good model for us.  Try listening to episode 80 or 81, which are daily wrap-ups from the Wikimania 2009 conference, or episode 78, which is a Skype-recorded episode.

Let's aim for 1/2 an hour to an hour.  (Wikipedia Weekly will sometimes be 1.5 hours, but that seems too long; a bit more editing can make the discussion go faster.)

= Scheduling time =

AMK is available weekends (pretty much any time), and weeknights 7PM-10PM US Eastern (23:00-2:00 UTC).

= Technical =

Wikipedia Weekly seems to record the audio from one single participant.  This means that the audio quality for a remote speaker will occasionally become bad or they'll drop out.
It would be better, though more effort, if *everyone* recorded their audio and sent to it to an editor.  That way everyone is represented by a high-quality local recording.
