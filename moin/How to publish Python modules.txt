There are various sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

The [http://www.python.org/pypi Python Package Index (or PyPI)] seems to be the current preferred location to list packages, and is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python.

The best-known one is the [http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py Vaults of Parnassus].  It requires that you host the files elsewhere, but it is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code out there.

Also, ActiveState hosts the [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/ Python Cookbook] for small useful bits.  Code submitted there is reviewed, and takes a while to appear on the site.

Finally, there is [http://www.uselesspython.com/ Useless Python] for all those bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing. 


'''Please add other places to publish Python code, notes, suggestions or anecdotes about the places above, or what have you.'''
