There are various sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

The [http://www.python.org/pypi Python Package Index (or PyPI)] seems to be the current preferred location to list packages, and is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python.

The best-known one is the [http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py Vaults of Parnassus].  It requires that you host the files elsewhere, but it is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code out there.

Also, ActiveState hosts the [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/ Python Cookbook] for small useful bits.  Code submitted there is reviewed, and takes a while to appear on the site.

There is [http://www.uselesspython.com/ Useless Python] for all those bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing.
