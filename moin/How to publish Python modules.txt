There are various sites that list or host submitted Python modules.

 * [http://www.python.org/pypi Python Package Index (aka "PyPI")] - seems to be the current preferred location to list packages, and is integrated with the distutils in recent versions of Python.
 * [http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py Vaults of Parnassus] - a link store for Python modules. You must host files elsewhere, but this is one of the oldest and largest lists of available Python code.
 * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/ Python Cookbook], hosted by ActiveState, for small useful bits.  Code submitted there is reviewed, and takes a while to appear on the site.
 * [http://www.uselesspython.com/ Useless Python] is indiscriminate, for all bits of code you don't think are ''worth'' publishing. 
 * This wiki - if a module is relatively short

I've cleaned the page up a bit. I took out the repetition of PyPI (listed twice), and [http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/index.phtml/fid/199/ faqts], since I didn't see that it was a "place to publish modules." I did reference it in the "See also's," since it did have relevant information.

Personally, I'de prefer not to have a page called "How to publish Python modules." It doesn't exactly lend itself to becomming [http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/LinkLanguage LinkLanguage.] I'd rather call the page: "PublishingPythonModules", or "PublishPythonModules", or even just a section of "PythonModules".
