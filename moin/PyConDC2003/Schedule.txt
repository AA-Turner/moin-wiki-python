Moin``Moin markup can handle these tables just fine. Here is the schedule for each day, with hyperlinks to presentation descriptions:

 * There is only half-an-hour allocated for the "Subversion from Within" paper tutorial.  This doesn't seem to be enough time to present a tutorial.

 * There is only 15 minutes for the "Introduction to the Semantic Web" talk, with four speakers.  This certainly is not enough time.  The schedule needs revision, I'm sure.

''I've been watching for changes on the "official" schedule, but there have been none. I suppose we'll find out when we get there'' --Jeff K.
