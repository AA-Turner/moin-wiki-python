coala is an easy to use code analysis tool that works for [[a lot of languages|https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/wiki/Supported-languages]] and can also automatically fix stuff. ''We would love to'':

 * Help you setting up ''code analysis for all languages in your project''.
 * Help you ''writing own analysis routines for your special needs''.
 * Implement ''support for a language you think is missing''.
 * Help ''newcomers'' with any kind experience to ''get started contributing to coala''. Opportunities vary from organizational and documentation work to solving challenging software architectural problems and writing some great code.

We will also conduct a number of lightning talks with our GSoC students if they don't get the opportunity to do that before at the conference.
