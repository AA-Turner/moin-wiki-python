[[http://coala-analyzer.org/|coala]] is an easy to use code analysis tool that works for [[https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/wiki/Supported-languages|a lot of languages]] and can also automatically fix stuff. ''We will'':

 * Help you setting up ''code analysis for all languages in your project''.
 * Help you ''writing own analysis routines for your special needs''.
 * Implement ''support for a language you think is missing''.
 * Help ''newcomers'' with any kind experience to ''get started contributing to coala''. Opportunities vary from organizational and documentation work to solving challenging software architectural problems and writing some great code.

'''There will be a mini conference happening as well.'''

We will have some lightning talks, possibly talks and/or workshops from various community members.

Some coala members will be around right from the start of the sprints. (9:30) If you're a fellow sprinter we'd love to help you set up coala for yor project, maybe we can make a small coala team go a round to the other projects helping them if they're interested.
