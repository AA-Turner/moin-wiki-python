= EuroPython 2007 Open Space =

Although Open Space is a dynamic element of the conference, proposed and scheduled as things happen at the venue, it's still likely that participants have a few topics to suggest even before the conference begins. This page will collect suggestions before and during the conference; precise scheduling and more topic gathering will be done at the venue during the conference. Look out for the Open Space scheduling boards!

== Suggested Topics ==

 * Python 3000 - migration, porting, 2.x and 3.x co-existence, etc.
 * The future of EuroPython (plus other conference activities) - oiling the wheels of the machine!
