'''Video Overview:'''

This course is your one-shot guide to statistical and machine learning analysis. This course will teach you regression analysis (for both statistical data analysis and machine learning) in Python—all in a practical, hands-on way.

Specifically, the course will:

• Take you from a basic level of statistical knowledge to a level where you can perform some of the most common advanced regression analysis-based techniques

• Equip you to use Python to perform various statistical and machine learning data analysis tasks

• Introduce you in a hands-on way to some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts, so you can apply them to practical data analysis and interpretation

You will get a strong background in some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts and their applications in regression analysis. You will be able to decide which regression analysis techniques are best suited for answering your research questions and most applicable to your data; then you'll interpret the results.

This is a practical, hands-on course—we spend time dealing with some theoretical concepts related to both statistical and machine learning regression analysis.

'''Video Overview:'''

Coding for beginners and kids is now made exciting and easy. Learn to code fun games, graphics and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python, one of the most powerful programming languages known for its speed, flexibility, and ease-of-use. The Python coding language integrates well with other platforms and runs on almost all modern devices. This OSI-approved open-source language allows free use and distribution (including commercial distribution).

This course helps you delve into the graphics and UX (user experience) aspects of Python. You’ll get up to speed with this computer language in a hands-on manner by drawing shapes, coding a simple game, and designing GUIs (graphical user interfaces), including a functional GUI for a temperature converter app. The course will also guide you through analyzing scientific and statistical data. As you advance, you’ll get to grips with developing educational software. In addition to this, you’ll gain comprehensive insights into accessing and organizing databases, along with understanding how to manage networks.

By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with using not only Python 2 but Python 3 as well for designing immersive games and developing interactive applications and websites.

Migrate from R to Python to perform effective data analysis

R has been the go-to language in data science for the last decade. However, given the latest developments and enhancements in Python's capabilities and its numerous supportive libraries, Python has dethroned R and is the first choice for data science enthusiasts, especially those working on descriptive and prescriptive analytics.

With this course, you will be familiar with Python functions and will be able to transform your R code into Python with far fewer lines of code, better performance, and increased speed.

Learn to use Python for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

Assume your target is running unpatched Windows XP, Anti-Virus is disabled, the firewall is turned off, IPS is not in place then you may (or not) get into a system! Does that sound like a real-world penetration test for you?

If you have ever attended an ethical hacking course that teaches you how to use some tools and how to click on some buttons, then you probably already know that being an advanced hacker needs more knowledge than clicking a few buttons as most of these tools will fail in a real-world scenario.

Whether you get bored from theory and basic courses which repeat the same tools and techniques over and over again and fail to teach you how to hack into even insecure systems, or you want to push your skills from beginner to the next level, then you have come to the right place!

There are quite a lot of people who call themselves hackers but, few have the solid skills to fit the definition, when other's tools fail, writing your own makes you a true hacker.

A straight-to-the-point Python course to quickly get you started with writing Python code and creating Python programs.

This Python course will get you up and running with Python very quickly saving you time spent googling for video tutorials, exercises and examples. The course is ideal for those who haven't programmed before, but it also works for experienced programmers who want to learn Python as long as they don't get offended by a bit of extra explanations of programming concepts. You will start from scratch by learning all Python fundamentals and slowly progressing into more advanced Python third-party libraries and by the end of the course you will know how to write Python programs. You will actually build your a real Python program that has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python. As a bonus you will also learn how to convert that program into an executable that runs both on Windows and Mac as a standalone program so that you can give your program to anyone. The course also guides you on how to go about building even more advanced programs with Python. You will learn how to use Python third-party libraries for building programs in a wide range of application areas. This is not simply a tutorial. The content of the course consists of a mix of video lectures, quizzes, exercises, and discussions with the instructor and the fellow students giving you a complete package to help you become a professional Python programmer.
