'''Video Overview:'''

This course is your one-shot guide to statistical and machine learning analysis. This course will teach you regression analysis (for both statistical data analysis and machine learning) in Python—all in a practical, hands-on way.

Specifically, the course will:

• Take you from a basic level of statistical knowledge to a level where you can perform some of the most common advanced regression analysis-based techniques

• Equip you to use Python to perform various statistical and machine learning data analysis tasks

• Introduce you in a hands-on way to some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts, so you can apply them to practical data analysis and interpretation

You will get a strong background in some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts and their applications in regression analysis. You will be able to decide which regression analysis techniques are best suited for answering your research questions and most applicable to your data; then you'll interpret the results.

This is a practical, hands-on course—we spend time dealing with some theoretical concepts related to both statistical and machine learning regression analysis.

Learn to use Python for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

Assume your target is running unpatched Windows XP, Anti-Virus is disabled, the firewall is turned off, IPS is not in place then you may (or not) get into a system! Does that sound like a real-world penetration test for you?

If you have ever attended an ethical hacking course that teaches you how to use some tools and how to click on some buttons, then you probably already know that being an advanced hacker needs more knowledge than clicking a few buttons as most of these tools will fail in a real-world scenario.

Whether you get bored from theory and basic courses which repeat the same tools and techniques over and over again and fail to teach you how to hack into even insecure systems, or you want to push your skills from beginner to the next level, then you have come to the right place!

There are quite a lot of people who call themselves hackers but, few have the solid skills to fit the definition, when other's tools fail, writing your own makes you a true hacker.

Python is simple, but it isn't easy. Python emphasizes code readability, using indentation and whitespaces to create code blocks. This makes it simpler than C++ or Java, where curly braces and keywords are scattered across the code. Python is high-level, which allows programmers like you to create logic with fewer lines of code.

This course follows a problem-solution format to tackle common roadblocks in Python programming. How can we handle large datasets and files, processing them in Python efficiently? How can we address performance issues for long-running tasks?

Build high-performance, distributed, and parallel applications in Dask

Data analysts, Machine Learning professionals, and data scientists often use tools such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NumPy for data analysis on their personal computer. However, when they want to apply their analyses to larger datasets, these tools fail to scale beyond a single machine, and so the analyst is forced to rewrite their computation.

In this course, you’ll learn to scale your data analysis. Firstly, you will execute distributed data science projects right from data ingestion to data manipulation and visualization using Dask. Then, you will explore the Dask framework. After, see how Dask can be used with other common Python tools such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more.

'''Video Overview:'''

Creating actionable data from raw sources

For data to be useful and meaningful, it must be curated and refined. Data Wrangling with Python teaches you the core ideas behind these processes and equips you with knowledge of the most popular tools and techniques in the domain.

The course starts with the absolute basics of Python, focusing mainly on data structures. It then delves into the fundamental tools of data wrangling like NumPy and Pandas libraries. You'll explore useful insights into why you should stay away from traditional ways of data cleaning, as done in other languages, and take advantage of the specialized pre-built routines in Python. This combination of Python tips and tricks will also demonstrate how to use the same Python backend and extract/transform data from an array of sources including the Internet, large database vaults, and Excel financial tables. To help you prepare for more challenging scenarios, you'll cover how to handle missing or wrong data, and reformat it based on the requirements from the downstream analytics tool. The course will further help you grasp concepts through real-world examples and datasets.

By the end of this course, you will be confident in using a diverse array of sources to extract, clean, transform, and format your data efficiently.

Data is becoming a force to reckon with. With the amount of data that is being generated every minute, dealing with data has become more important. The importance of data lies in the fact that it allows us to look at our history and predict the future. Data science is the field that deals with collecting, sorting, organizing and also analyzing huge amounts of data. This data is then used to understand the current and future trends. This field borrows techniques and theories from across multiple fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, etc. It also aids other domains such as machine learning, data mining, databases and visualization. Data scientists are gaining importance and are also earning higher salaries, which means this is the right time to become a data scientist. While, it might seem easy, sorting data, these scientists are responsible for writing important algorithms and programs to help sort and analyze the data – and this isn’t an easy task.

The course will cover a number of different concepts such as an introduction to data science including concepts such as linear algebra, probability and statistics, Matplotlib, charts and graphs, data analysis, visualization of non uniform data, hypothesis and gradient descent, data clustering and so much more. That’s not all, we’ll also include projects to help you show exactly how to build visuals using Python. You can learn all this and tons of interesting stuff in this unique data science course.

This course assumes no programming experience and slowly builds the tools you need to take on larger challenges. Once this is done, dive into the fundamentals of Python programming with variables, numbers, strings, and so on. You'll learn to make decisions on your programs with conditional statements and discover that Python has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence such as a list or a string with loops.

You will see how functions play a major role to provide a high degree of code reusing. Along with the built-in functions, you will be able to build your own functions as well. When you've done all this, you'll be ready to create modules in Python all by yourself. Finally, you'll enhance your skills by performing some very interesting manipulations on images.

'''What You Will Learn''':

 * Get to know Python’s data structures to enhance good design patterns and scalability to your code
 * Construct loops to perform repeated tasks
 * Create functions in Python to provide programs with better modularity
 * Understand the concept of function recursion adding clarity to write and debug codes
 * Manage program control flow and branching to perform conditional tasks
 * Install third-party libraries to add advanced customizations to images

The viewer will know the basics of what programming languages are, but won’t need any knowledge of Python. Nor will the need any actual hands-on experience in a specific language.
