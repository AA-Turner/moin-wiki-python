 Rough Notes on a Possible Website for buildout ( http://www.buildout.org/ )
============================================================================

Objectives:

 + to give buildout a more professional face on the web
 + to raise the awareness of the buildout tool within the Python community
 + to improve and aggregate the documentation in a more friendly form
 + to provide a one-stop resource for learning about buildout recipes

Site Outline:

  + what is it, in a nutshell?
  + list of features
  + list of recipes
  + success stories
  + status box re version and stability
  + how-to installation
     + easy_install zc.buildout
  + resources
     + manual(s)
     + screencasts that teach usage
     + mailing lists
     + IRC hangout
     + a wiki? or use wiki.zope.org/buildout?
     + ptr to issue tracker
     + ptr to the buildout subversion repository
     + set of tutorial stories re specific recipes and situations

Approach:

 + host it on a community machine, perhaps where Zope Foundation is now
 + base it on a Zope 3 site installation
 + rely upon contributed documents written in reStructuredText
