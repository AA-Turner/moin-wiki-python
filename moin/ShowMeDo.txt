We are seeking new tutorial and educational videos (they are
[http://showmedo.com/videos/screencasting very easy to make]) - please get
in touch and help us to share Python knowledge.

We have been growing since December 2005 and we actively request feedback from you for which topics we should cover in the future.  What would you like to learn more about?

Should we have written material as well?  Would beginners like good introductions to 'getting started with Python', and 'learning how to debug'?  We are very interested in your feedback, just drop us a line at [mailto:helloNOSPAM@showmedo.com hello@showmedo.com] (remove NOSPAM).
