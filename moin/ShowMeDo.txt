Showmedo.com was a site where creators could upload Video tutorial content - like happens on YouTube now; in its early days that kind of content was quite uncommon. There used to be a of lot great Python content. The main site is no longer running; the wiki page has been hacked and has tons of dodgy content. Some of the original content *may* still be findable at [[https://archive.org/|The internet archive]]. The Python wiki no longer tries to maintain links to former ShowMeDo content given the problems.
