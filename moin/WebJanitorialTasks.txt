This page lists web-related Python tasks that people can work on.

= Issues for Python system administration =

 1. Consistent place for keeping source
 1. Storing passwords (e.g. Mailman admin password, 
 1. Version-controlling configuration files (would be nice to get e-mail notifications)

= Content to move into the Wiki =

Jobs?

UserGroup listings

Mirror list

SIG pages?

Topic guides

= Janitorial tasks =

Translate HTML pages into ReST

Make pages valid HTML (easiest for ReST pages  -- just fix up the template)

Replace all links to /topics/learn/ with links to /moin/BeginnersGuide

Figure out Apache incantations to remove /moin/ prefix from Wiki pages (so you could access
www.python.org/BeginnersGuide or whatever).

Install [http://www.snert.com/Software/mod_throttle/ mod_throttle] and configure it to limit access 
to the Wiki; impolite robots can make the load average on creosote explode.
