= XML-RPC =

XML-RPC is a neat way to send messages across the Internet.

The neat thing about XML-RPC is that it transports ''native data structures''- you can ship off lists, strings, dictionaries, and numbers.

You can [wiki:Wiki/XmlRpc read more about it over on C2,] or on [http://www.xml-rpc.com/ the XML-RPC home page.]

== Sample Code ==
{{{
#!python
import xmlrpclib

XMLRPC_SERVER_URL = "http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/?action=xmlrpc"

pythoninfo = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy( XMLRPC_SERVER_URL )
allpages = pythoninfo.getAllPages() # this is the XML-RPC call

print ", ".join( allpages )
}}}

This code calls the PythonInfo wiki, and receives the TitleIndex as a list.
