XML-RPC makes calling remote functions incredibly easy. 

From http://www.xml-rpc.com:
''It's a spec and a set of implementations that allow software running on disparate operating systems, running in different environments to make procedure calls over the Internet.

It's remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be transmitted, processed and returned.''


Here is a bit of sample code to call a procedure ''message'' (passing in the first argument) on a server listening on localhost, port 8000:
{{{
#!python
# messageclient.py 

import xmlrpclib
import sys

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:8000')
    s.message(sys.argv[1])

}}}

(also, see [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/xmlrpc-client-example.html this example] and the [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xmlrpclib.html xmlrpclib documentation])
