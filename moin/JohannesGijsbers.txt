Johannes, did you update the wiki software while I played dead? Or do you know whether anyone else did? -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2003-10-24T20:36:55Z)]]

Do you mean the engine or the configuration? I didn't update the engine, but I did integrate the layout with the rest of the site. -- JohannesGijsbers

The engine. I'll do that then in the near future. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2003-10-30T23:03:01Z)]]
