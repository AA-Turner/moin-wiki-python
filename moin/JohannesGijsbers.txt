I am a student currently in the last year of VWO, and will study Computer Sciences at the University of Utrecht next year. I use Python for a wide variety of tasks, including replacing shell scripts and automatically converting Microsoft Word documents to websites.

I'm currently working on a syntax highlighter for complete projects, making it easy to browse through all of the code. I use [http://www.program-transformation.org/twiki/bin/view/Tools/XT XT], a bundle of program transformation tools to ease the parsing.----
