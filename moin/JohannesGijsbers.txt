So, if we had a nice pattern repository wiki, we could write about ''decorate-sort-undecorate'' there and link to it... ''{;D}='' -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2003-11-21T22:18:39Z)]]

Wiki:PortlandPatternRepository? ;) -- JohannesGijsbers

Two thoughts:

  * I'd like a ''focused'' design patterns community.
  * I'd like a ''block'' patterns community.

I think that there is a type of pattern that people use within a procedure.

For an example of a basic one, there is the ForLoop.

But there are also others, like First``Time``Seperate versus First``Time``Integrated.

That is, do you:

{{{
#!python
first_time_a()
always_b()
first_time_c()
always_d()

while condition:
  always_b()
  always_d()
}}}

...or do you...

{{{
#!python
first=1

while condition:
    if first: first_time_a()
    always_b()
    if first: first_time_c()
    always_d()
    first=0
}}}

Surely, there are advantages to each one, no?

I taught beginning programmers for 2 years. I found that I didn't have words for a lot of things that I was trying to explain to them. Now I think I have the word for it: a "block pattern."

I think a site of block patterns would be interesting, and very beneficial for study by beginners.

Decorate``Sort``Undecorate may be a block pattern. But maybe not- maybe it's an algorithmic pattern. But are they that different?

Speaking of algorithms- we need multiple algorithms wiki. {:)}=

Good talking with you. Feel free to delete whenever you like.

What do you mean with a block pattern? It seems like another level of Scope (as in the Wiki:DesignPatternsBook). -- JohannesGijsbers

As for DP: Yes, it is a matter of scope.

My design patterns book isn't about how you arrange your lines and variables within a function. It's about how you arrange your collection of classes, objects. I want "block design patterns," to give my students who are just trying to figure out how to write a function.

Like: "Nested``Loops," to do things like cycling over lists of lists, and hitting all of them.

I've been programming since I was 7 years old. When I took CS in college, I got to watch people smarter than I am struggle with how to calculate out a multiplication table, or follow two pointers in a row.

I don't think they're stupid. I think that I just figured out, through trial and error, in my first years of programming, how to make these basic structures.

It'd be nice to have a systematic way to teach those basic "block" patterns. (I'm just making up the term.)

-- LionKimbro

I see what you're getting at. How about "ProceduralPatterns", with block patterns being one of the scopes involved.  The other scope would probably be about splitting things up into functions. -- JohannesGijsbers

Yes, yes, that's exactly it. Though I don't think it should pollute ''this'' wiki. :) -- LionKimbro
