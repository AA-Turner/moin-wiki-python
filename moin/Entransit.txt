This is a tough one:  while Entransit already has at least a couple
of what look like home pages (see below), it deserves an explanation better suited
to the context of the Python Wiki.  Its ecological niche is a
challenge to explain, though ...

Entransit is open-source software (exclusively?  predominantly?
This answer might change in 2007-2008).  It was originally created
to effect "content delivery" as a front end for ["Plone"] as a 
back-end "["content management system"]".  This is a WebFrameworks
piece for people with '''big''' sites. 

Entransit incorporates search technologies, or at least "hooks",
and explicitly invites front-end development with Java, .NET, and
PHP.

The 
[http://plone.org/products/entransit Plone site summarizes], "The Entransit Content Delivery System allows a hybrid approach to content management that creates an open source alternative to expensive mid-tier content management systems.

as one of its product offerings.
