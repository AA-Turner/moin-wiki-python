= Parallel Processing and Multiprocessing in Python =
A number of Python-related libraries exist for the programming of solutions either employing multiple CPUs or multicore CPUs in a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing|symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)]] or shared memory environment, or potentially huge numbers of computers in a cluster or grid environment. This page seeks to provide references to the different libraries and solutions available.

== Just In Time Compilation ==
Some Python libraries allow compiling Python functions at run time, this is called Just In Time (JIT) compilation.

 * [[https://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html|Nuitka]] - As the authors say: Nuitka is a Python compiler written in Python !  
  * You feed Nuitka your Python app, it does a lot of clever things, and spits out an executable or extension module.
  * Nuitka translates Python into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute exactly like CPython
  * For version 0.6 of Nuitka and Python 2.7 speedup was 312% !

 * [[http://numba.pydata.org/|Numba]] - Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.
  * Numba can use vectorized instructions (SIMD - Single Instruction Multiple Data) like SSE/AVX
  * Numba can simplify multithreading
  * Numba can compile on GPU

 * [[https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|Pythran]]  - Pythran is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific computing.
  * It takes a Python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it into a native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.
  * It is meant to efficiently compile scientific programs, and takes advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.

 
 * [[https://www.pyston.org/|Pyston]]  - Pyston is a faster CPython implementation using C optimisation and [[https://luajit.org/dynasm.html|DynASM]] Just In Time compiler
  * After having been stopped in 2017 new version is back again since Python 3.8.8
  * It says to be 30% faster than CPython by just replacing CPython by Pyston version without updating your code.

 * [[https://cython.org/|Cython]]  - Cython is a language which adds C types declaration to Python language
  * Thus, it allows converting Cython code to C code and compile it as a C python library that can be imported as a real python package  
    Except that you are executing compiled code.
  * Cython also helps removing the GIL to parallelize code


== Symmetric Multiprocessing ==
Some libraries, often to preserve some similarity with more familiar concurrency models (such as Python's threading API), employ parallel processing techniques which limit their relevance to SMP-based hardware, mostly due to the usage of process creation functions such as the UNIX fork system call. However, a technique called process migration may permit such libraries to be useful in certain kinds of computational clusters as well, notably [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-system_image|single-system image]] cluster solutions ([[http://kerrighed.org/|Kerrighed]], [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ssic-linux|OpenSSI]], [[http://openmosix.sourceforge.net/|OpenMosix]] being examples).

 * [[http://dispy.sourceforge.net/|dispy]] - Python module for distributing computations (functions or programs) computation processors (SMP or even distributed over network) for parallel execution. The computations can be scheduled by supplying arguments in SIMD style of parallel processing. The computation units can be shared by multiple processes/users simultaneously if desired. dispy is implemented with asynchronous sockets, coroutines and efficient polling mechanisms for high performance and scalability.
 * [[http://lfw.org/python/delegate.html|delegate]] - fork-based process creation with pickled data sent through pipes
 * [[http://honeypot.net/2007/07/06/multi-processing-map-python/|forkmap (original)]] - fork-based process creation using a function resembling Python's built-in map function (''Unix, Mac, Cygwin''). (Original version)
 * [[https://github.com/larroy/mycelium/blob/master/dist/utils/forkfun.py|forkfun (modified)]] - fork-based process creation using a function resembling Python's built-in map function (''Unix, Mac, Cygwin''). (New version from July-2011 with modifications)
 * [[https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|Joblib]] - Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python. In particular:
  * transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation (memoize pattern)
  * easy simple parallel computing (single computer)
 * [[http://honeypot.net/2008/04/16/yet-another-python-map/|ppmap]] - variant of forkmap using pp to manage the subprocesses (''Unix, Mac, Cygwin'')
 * [[http://poshmodule.sourceforge.net/|POSH]] Python Object Sharing is an extension module to Python that allows objects to be placed in shared memory. POSH allows concurrent processes to communicate simply by assigning objects to shared container objects. (''POSIX/UNIX/Linux only'')
 * [[http://www.parallelpython.com/|pp]] (Parallel Python) - process-based, job-oriented solution with cluster support (''Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac'')
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/pprocess|pprocess]] (previously parallel/pprocess) - fork-based process creation with asynchronous channel-based communications employing pickled data [[http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/pprocess/tutorial.html|(tutorial)]] (''currently only POSIX/UNIX/Linux, perhaps Cygwin'')
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/processing|processing]] - process-based using either fork on Unix or the subprocess module on Windows, implementing an API like the standard library's threading API and providing familiar objects such as queues and semaphores. Can use native semaphores, message queues etc or can use of a manager process for sharing objects (''Unix and Windows''). [[http://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing|Included in Python 2.6/3.0 as multiprocessing]], and [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/|backported under the same name]].
 * [[http://code.google.com/p/pycsp|PyCSP]] Communicating Sequential Processes for Python allows easy construction of processes and synchronised communication.
 * [[https://github.com/classner/pymp|PyMP]] - OpenMP inspired, fork-based framework for conveniently creating parallel for-loops and sections. Supports Python 2 and 3. (''Unix only'')
 * [[https://github.com/ray-project/ray|Ray]] - Parallel (and distributed) process-based execution framework which uses a lightweight API based on dynamic task graphs and actors to flexibly express a wide range of applications. Uses shared-memory and zero-copy serialization for efficient data handling within a single machine. Supports low-latency and high-throughput task scheduling. Includes higher-level libraries for machine learning and AI applications. Supports Python 2 and 3. (''Linux, Mac'')
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/remoteD|remoteD]] - fork-based process creation with a dictionary-based communications paradigm (''platform independent, according to PyPI entry'')
 * [[https://github.com/IBM/torc_py|torcpy]] - a platform-agnostic adaptive load balancing library that orchestrates the scheduling of task parallelism on both shared and distributed memory platforms. It takes advantage of MPI and multithreading, supports parallel nested loops and map functions and task stealing at all levels of parallelism.
 * [[http://github.com/undefx/vecpy|VecPy]] (Vectorizing Python for concurrent SIMD execution) - Takes as input a Python function on scalars and outputs a symantically equivalent C++ function over vectors which leverages multi-threading and SIMD vector intrinsics. Generated code is compiled into a native, shared library that can be called from Python (as a module), Java (through JNI), and C++. (''Linux-only; requires Python 3, g++'')

Advantages of such approaches include convenient process creation and the ability to share resources. Indeed, the fork system call permits efficient sharing of common read-only data structures on modern UNIX-like operating systems.

== Cluster Computing ==
Unlike SMP architectures and especially in contrast to thread-based concurrency, cluster (and grid) architectures offer high scalability due to the relative absence of shared resources, although this can make the programming paradigms seem somewhat alien to uninitiated developers. In this domain, some overlap with other distributed computing technologies may be observed (see DistributedProgramming for more details).

This module can be used separately -- e.g. to compute something else than evolutionary algorithms -- and offers an interface similar to the multiprocessing.Pool module (map, apply, synchronous or asynchronous spawns, etc.), providing a complete abstraction of the startup process and the communication and load balancing layers. It currently works over MPI, with mpi4py or PyMPI, or directly over TCP. Its unique structure allows some interesting features, like nested parallel map (a parallel map calling another distributed operation, and so on).

The computations can be scheduled by supplying arguments in SIMD style of parallel processing. The nodes can be shared by multiple processes/users simultaneously if desired. dispy is implemented with asynchronous sockets, coroutines and efficient polling mechanisms for high performance and scalability.
 * [[http://code.google.com/p/distributed-python-for-scripting/|DistributedPython]] - Very simple Python distributed computing framework, using ssh and the multiprocessing and subprocess modules.

 * [[http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/|ScientificPython]] contains three subpackages for parallel computing:
  * Scientific.DistributedComputing.MasterSlave implements a master-slave model in which a master process requests computational tasks that are executed by an arbitrary number of slave processes. The strong points are ease of use and the possibility to work with a varying number of slave process. It is less suited for the construction of large, modular parallel applications. Ideal for parallel scripting. Uses [[http://pyro.sourceforge.net/|"Pyro"]]. (''works wherever Pyro works'')
  * Scientific.BSP is an object-oriented implementation of the [[http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/|"Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)"]] model for parallel computing, whose main advantages over message passing are the impossibility of deadlocks and the possibility to evaluate the computational cost of an algorithm as a function of machine parameters.

== Cloud Computing ==
Cloud computing is similar to cluster computing, except the developer's compute resources are owned and managed by a third party, the "cloud provider". By not having to purchase and set up hardware, the developer is able to run massively parallel workloads cheaper and easier.

 * [[http://code.google.com/appengine/|Google App Engine]] - supports Python.
 * [[http://www.picloud.com/|PiCloud]] - is a cloud-computing platform that integrates into Python. It allows developers to leverage the computing power of [[http://aws.amazon.com/|Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) without having to manage, maintain, or configure their own virtual servers. [[http://www.picloud.com/|PiCloud]] integrates into a Python code base via its custom library, ''cloud''. Offloading the execution of a function to PiCloud's auto-scaling cluster (located on AWS) is as simple as passing the desired function into PiCloud's ''cloud'' library.
  . For example, invoking ''cloud.call(foo)'' results in ''foo()'' being executed on PiCloud. Invoking ''cloud.map(foo, range(10))'' results in 10 functions, ''foo(0)'', ''foo(1)'', etc. being executed on PiCloud.

 * [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycompss/|PyCOMPSs]]  - A task based a programming model which aims to ease the development  of parallel applications for  distributed infrastructures, such as  Clusters and Clouds. Offers a sequential interface, but at execution   time the runtime system is able to exploit the inherent parallelism of   applications at task level.

 * [[http://web.mit.edu/stardev/cluster|StarCluster]] - is a cluster-computing toolkit for the [[http://aws.amazon.com/|AWS cloud]].
