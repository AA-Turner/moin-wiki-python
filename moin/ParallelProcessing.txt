= Parallel Processing and Multiprocessing in Python =

A number of Python-related libraries exist for the programming of solutions either employing multiple CPUs or multicore CPUs in a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing|symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)]] or shared memory environment, or potentially huge numbers of computers in a cluster or grid environment. This page seeks to provide references to the different libraries and solutions available.

== Symmetric Multiprocessing ==

Some libraries, often to preserve some similarity with more familiar concurrency models (such as Python's threading API), employ parallel processing techniques which limit their relevance to SMP-based hardware, mostly due to the usage of process creation functions such as the UNIX fork system call. However, a technique called process migration may permit such libraries to be useful in certain kinds of computational clusters as well, notably [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-system_image|single-system image]] cluster solutions ([[http://kerrighed.org|Kerrighed]], [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ssic-linux|OpenSSI]], [[http://openmosix.sourceforge.net/|OpenMosix]] being examples).

 * [[http://lfw.org/python/delegate.html|delegate]] - fork-based process creation with pickled data sent through pipes
 * [[http://honeypot.net/multi-processing-map-python|forkmap]] - fork-based process creation using a function resembling Python's built-in map function (''Unix, Mac, Cygwin'')
 * [[http://honeypot.net/yet-another-python-map|ppmap]] - variant of forkmap using pp to manage the subprocesses (''Unix, Mac, Cygwin'')
 * [[http://poshmodule.sourceforge.net/|POSH]] Python Object Sharing is an extension module to Python that allows objects to be placed in shared memory.  POSH allows concurrent processes to communicate simply by assigning objects to shared container objects. (''POSIX/UNIX/Linux only'')
 * [[http://www.parallelpython.com/|pp]] (Parallel Python) - process-based, job-oriented solution with cluster support (''Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac'')
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/pprocess|pprocess]] (previously parallel/pprocess) - fork-based process creation with asynchronous channel-based communications employing pickled data [[http://www.boddie.org.uk/python/pprocess/tutorial.html|(tutorial)]] (''currently only POSIX/UNIX/Linux, perhaps Cygwin'')
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/processing|processing]] - process-based using either fork on Unix or the subprocess module on Windows, implementing an API like the standard library's threading API and providing familiar objects such as queues and semaphores.  Can use native semaphores, message queues etc or can use of a manager process for sharing objects (''Unix and Windows''). [[http://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing|Included in Python 2.6/3.0 as multiprocessing]], and [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/|backported under the same name]].
 * [[http://www.python.org/pypi/remoteD|remoteD]] - fork-based process creation with a dictionary-based communications paradigm (''platform independent, according to PyPI entry'')

Advantages of such approaches include convenient process creation and the ability to share resources. Indeed, the fork system call permits efficient sharing of common read-only data structures on modern UNIX-like operating systems.

== Cluster Computing ==

Unlike SMP architectures and especially in contrast to thread-based concurrency, cluster (and grid) architectures offer high scalability due to the relative absence of shared resources, although this can make the programming paradigms seem somewhat alien to uninitiated developers. In this domain, some overlap with other distributed computing technologies may be observed (see DistributedProgramming for more details).

Clients submit jobs to a master object which is monitored by one or more slave objects that do the real work. Two main implementations are currently provided, one using multiple threads and one multiple processes in one or more hosts through [[http://pyro.sourceforge.net/|Pyro]].

 * [[http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/|ScientificPython]] contains three subpackages for parallel computing:
   * Scientific.Distributed``Computing.Master``Slave implements a master-slave model in which a master process requests computational tasks that are executed by an arbitrary number of slave processes. The strong points are ease of use and the possibility to work with a varying number of slave process. It is less suited for the construction of large, modular parallel applications. Ideal for parallel scripting. Uses [[http://pyro.sourceforge.net/|"Pyro"]]. (''works wherever Pyro works'')
   * Scientific.BSP is an object-oriented implementation of the [[http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/|"Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)"]] model for parallel computing, whose main advantages over message passing are the impossibility of deadlocks and the possibility to evaluate the computational cost of an algorithm as a function of machine parameters. The Python implementation of BSP features parallel data objects, communication of arbitrary Python objects, and a framework for defining distributed data objects implementing parallelized methods. (''works on all platforms that have an MPI library or an implementation of BSPlib'')
   * Scientific.MPI is an interface to MPI that emphasizes the possibility to combine Python and C code, both using MPI. Contrary to pypar and pyMPI, it does not support the communication of arbitrary Python objects, being instead optimized for Numeric/NumPy arrays. (''works on all platforms that have an MPI library'')
 * [[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~astraw/seppo.html|seppo]] - based on Pyro mobile code, providing a parallel map function which evaluates each iteration "in a different process, possibly in a different computer".
 * "[[http://www.interactivesupercomputing.com/getpr.php?id=246|Star-P for Python]] is an interactive parallel computing platform ..."
 * [[http://code.google.com/p/superpy/|superpy]] distributes python programs across a cluster of machines or across multiple processors on a single machine. Key features include:
    * Send tasks to remote servers or to same machine via XML RPC call
    * GUI to launch, monitor, and kill remote tasks
    * GUI can automatically launch tasks every day, hour, etc.
    * Works on the Microsoft Windows operating system
          * Can run as a windows service
          * Jobs submitted to windows can run as submitting user or as service user 
    * Inputs/outputs are python objects via python pickle
    * Pure python implementation
    * Supports simple load-balancing to send tasks to best servers 

== Cloud Computing ==

Cloud computing is similar to cluster computing, except the developer's compute resources are owned and managed by a third party, the "cloud provider".  By not having to purchase and set up hardware, the developer is able to run massively parallel workloads cheaper and easier.

  * [[http://code.google.com/appengine/|Google App Engine]] - supports Python.

  * [[http://www.picloud.com|PiCloud]] - is a cloud-computing platform that integrates into Python. It allows developers to leverage the computing power of [[http://aws.amazon.com|Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) without having to manage, maintain, or configure their own virtual servers. [[http://www.picloud.com|PiCloud]] integrates into a Python code base via its custom library, ''cloud''. Offloading the execution of a function to !PiCloud's auto-scaling cluster (located on AWS) is as simple as passing the desired function into !PiCloud's ''cloud'' library.  

   For example, invoking ''cloud.call(foo)'' results in ''foo()'' being executed on !PiCloud. 
   Invoking ''cloud.map(foo, range(10))'' results in 10 functions, ''foo(0)'', ''foo(1)'', etc. being executed on !PiCloud.
