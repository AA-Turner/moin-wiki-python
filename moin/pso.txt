=== Comments ===
I have just started using this as my hosting company only runs Python 2.2 at the moment and uses Zeus instead of Apache, so no mod_python. It really didn't take me long to pick it up and within a couple of hours I had my blog written, a set of back-end tools to manage it as well as the archive view for permalinks. I also went and added a log parser to track certain traffic patterns on my site using the PSO framework, and that took me all of 15 minutes to throw together. I haven't tried some of the servlet clones yet, but so far, PSO definitely suits all my needs. It's well put together and runs incredibly fast, even over cgi. You can see for yourself at [http://www.davtri.com/thoughts.cgi David Giffin's Thoughts, projects, ideas and ramblings] If anyone knows the authors, I would love to see the project taken to completion.
