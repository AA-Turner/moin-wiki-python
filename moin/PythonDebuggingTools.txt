=== Debuggers ===
||<tablewidth="&quot" tablestyle="100%&quot">'''Name''' ||'''Platform''' ||'''   Notes   ''' ||
||[[https://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html|pdb]] ||All ||The standard library debugger, part of all Python installations. ||
||[[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb|pudb]] ||Unix,Mac OS X ||A visual, console-based, full-screen debugger, designed as a more comfortable drop-in replacement for pdb. (also supports IPython) ||
||PdbRcIdea ||All ||A .pdbrc for Python's standard debugger, pdb,  which allows you to run arbitrary Python commands on pdb startup. ||
||gdb ||*nix ||See DebuggingWithGdb ||
||[[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/trepan2|trepan2]], [[https://pypi.org/project/trepan3k/|trepan3k]] ||Unix, Windows, Mac OS X ||A rewrite of pdb/pydb with closer compliance to gdb . This is the only debugger that I (rocky) am aware of that uses decompilation technology (also written by me), so that you can debug CPython bytcode files where no source code is available. Decompilation is also used to provide sensible debugging inside exec strings, and more accurate position information when stopped or in showing a stack trace. In addition to the  features of pdb/pydb, the debugger supports syntax coloring (via pygments),  has extensive on-line help (in rendered [[reStructuredText]]), [[https://python3-trepan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|readthedocs documentation]], command completion, a smarter eval, debugger macros written in Python, and more. ||
||[[https://github.com/antocuni/pdb|pdb++]] ||Unix, Windows, Mac OS X ||An extension of the pdb module of the standard library. It is meant to be fully compatible with its predecessor, yet it introduces a number of new features to make your debugging experience as nice as possible. ||
||[[https://github.com/benmezger/pydebug|Python-pydebug]] ||Unix, Windows, Mac OS X ||A set of debugging decorators which respects Django's settings in case the package is withing a Django project. It allows a user to PDB into a function, do a Line profiler, inspect an object and Disasemble the function. ||
||[[https://pypi.org/project/winpdb-reborn/|winpdb-reborn]] || Windows, Linux || Fork of winpdb after this was unmaintained ||
||[[https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb|ipdb]] || All || Improved version of pdb that is part of IPython but also can be used separately ||
||[[https://github.com/kmaork/madbg|madbg]] || linux, python>=3.7 || fully-featured remote debugger: attaching to running programs, especially usefull to debug programms with TUI ||

Debuggers that are no longer maintained:

||[[http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/pydb|pydb]] ||Unix, Windows, OS X ||Obsolete. An expanded version of pdb loosely based on the gdb command set. The debugger supports thread debugging, signal handling, non-interactive tracing, and much more. This was written in the era of Python 2.4-2.6. See trepan3k below. ||
||[[https://web.archive.org/web/20151108104131/http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/xpdb.html|Xpdb]] ||Unix ||pdb extension with '''curses''' module that adds console window with source code. ||

It uses bdb (part of stdlib) but adds a GUI and has some powerful features like object browser, windows for variables, classes, functions, exceptions, stack, conditional breakpoints, etc. ||
||[[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpdb/|rpdb]] ||Unix, Windows,Mac OS X ||(Predecessor of rpdb2 and winpdb) rpdb.py improves pdb's usability and adds support for remote debugging, multiple threads debugging, post mortem of unhandled exceptions, and for debugging of embedded scripts. ||
||[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/|DDD]] ||Unix ||Graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, GNU Make debugger, or the Python debugger. DDD displays data structures as graphs and plots. A deprecated version of pydb comes with this package. For GNU make debugging, use [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61395&package_id=65341|ddd-test5]] ||
||[[http://pyclewn.sourceforge.net/|Pyclewn]] ||*nix, Windows ||Pyclewn allows you to use [[http://www.vim.org/|Vim]] as a front end to a debugger. Pyclewn currently supports gdb and pdb. ||

=== IDEs with Debug Capabilities ===
Since debugging is one of the the functions that usually helps make up the "Integrated" in "Integrated Development Environment", expect that most IDEs will have debugging capability even if not listed explicitly here.

The GUI includes a Debug Probe, which is a Python shell running in the context of the paused debug process.  The IDE's debugger also features value watching (by symbolic path, object reference, or a combination), conditional breakpoints, move program counter, debugging of tests running in the integrated unit testing tool, special support for Django, and How-Tos for debugging code running under Flask, web3py, Django, Google App Engine, wxPython, PyQt, Tkinter, Blender, Maya, NUKE, and many other packages. ||
