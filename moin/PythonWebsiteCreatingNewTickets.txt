  Please accept my apologies for editing this page inappropriately as a crude way of making a bug report, but for a simple little item like this it's just not worth the reader's time to go through a non-automated system for registering on Trac. (If I could have registered instantaneously I would have used Trac.) Anyhow, here are the bug reports I wanted to make:
    1. The release date of 2.5.1 on //www.python.org/download is wrong, it says Apr 18, 2006 but it should be 2007. (I would have just fixed it myself if that page were open to edits; I would have registered to edit if the process had been automatic.)
    2. I think you probably have the ACL on this page incorrect, given that I could edit it. :-)
