= Special Interest Groups =

Many Python projects are organized around Special Interest Groups (SIGs).  Each SIG tends to have a mailing list, and works on sub-projects related to Python.  There are SIGs for database development, distribution and packaging, the email package, etc.  Below are a list of SIGs along with links to their mailing list information and sub-pages used to coordinate development.
