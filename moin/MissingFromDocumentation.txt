This page lists various things that aren't documented in the main Python docs,
but should be.  We should try to fix these before 2.5final.

= Features =

The reference manual doesn't mention new-style classes at all.  (I can't see that it really specifies the semantics of old-style classes, either.)  I'm not sure the information is even collected anywhere.  A start is now at NewClassVsClassicClass

Iterator protocol not described on its own (mentioned in passing in ref's discussion of generators)

Are nested scopes explained in the ref?

PEPS that aren't covered: new-style classes.

= Other tasks =

Also see ModulesThatNeedDocs.

Add example code to various modules.
