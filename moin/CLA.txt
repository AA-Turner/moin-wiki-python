Q (2014-02-07): Can anybody explain CLA to me? Everybody says that I should sign this - http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/ - but can't explain why - is there a FAQ or something?


=== Facts ===

 * (2014-02-07) There is no information explaining CLA or link to CLA FAQ leading from the CLA page - http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/


=== CLA Examples ===

 * Gephi CLA explanation - https://consortium.gephi.org/cla.html
 * Gephi CLA - https://consortium.gephi.org/docs/icla.txt

 * Google CLA v1.1 - https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual


=== Open Petition ===

The idea is to create petition that will set the new defaults that will eliminate the need for CLA to free open source software projects from the stuff the hurts collaboration. This includes the proposal that if you submit code that is patented or not yours or can not be submitted because it is under conflicting license - you must say this explicitly. In all other cases you're aware of the license projects uses and agree to release your contribution under the same license.
