Q (2014-02-07): Can anybody explain CLA to me? Everybody says that I should sign this - http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/ - but can't explain why - is there a FAQ or something?


=== Facts ===

 * (2014-02-07) There is information explaining CLA or link to CLA FAQ leading from the CLA page - http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/
