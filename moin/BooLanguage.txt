A language for the .NET/Mono runtime with a syntax near identical to Python's.

http://boo.codehaus.org/

See [[http://boo.codehaus.org/Gotchas+for+Python+Users|Gotchas for Python Users]] for specific comparisons between boo and CPython.

The main difference is that boo is statically typed with type inference.  Syntax-wise it is like Python, but feature-wise it is also similar to C#.  It implements many features that have been suggested for [[Python3.0]], including a "with" statement and optional explicit static typing declarations ("x as int").  Extra features include anonymous methods`/`closures, custom macros and attributes (similar to PythonDecorators), and soon, optional case-insensitivity.
