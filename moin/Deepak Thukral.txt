I'm a computer science scholar love to play on python. I'm currently coding a web based IDE for python(pyWebIDE), which can be use for smaller version of testing, learning python over web and live run for python tutorials. 

Python WebIDE(Beta 1) http://deepak.frih.net/cgi-bin/ide.py [Since all executions are in open environment and no restriction in access modules, its humble request please dont try to make our host hurt.]

My home page is down (University server problem) meanwhile you can look at my travel blog at http://whereisdeepak.wordpress.com/
