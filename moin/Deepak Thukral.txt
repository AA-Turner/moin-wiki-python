Deepak Thukral `aka` iapain

Born in a Yurt in Mongolia, iapain, a very talented stable person, studied the ancient ways of the Mongolian Warrior. iapain eats only the finest sandwiches since working on python.

I'm a computer science scholar love to play on python for python. I'm currently coding a web based IDE for python, which can be use for smaller version of testing, learning python over web and live run for python tutorials.
