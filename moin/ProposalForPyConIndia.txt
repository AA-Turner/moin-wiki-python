= Proposal for PyCon India =

PyCon is globally a community event. We intent to have an Indian Edition of the same, in association with BangPypers. The Idea is to have all the pythoneers around the country to come together have a good pythonic time and fun. The General Outline is something as follows:

 * Tutorials

 * General Talks

 * Workshops

 * Lightning Talks

 * Programming Sprints
  
 
== TODO List ==

 * Contact David Goodger of PSF to express the idea for an Indian edition of the conference, and for using the PyCon title. (Ramakrishna Reddy)

 * Write formal proposal
 * Find venue
 * Find Sponsors
 * Finalize Date -- 3 days (September)
    -- I suggest September 4,5,6 (Baiju M)
 * Form a planning committee

   * PyCon India should  be a conference, not an unconference.
   * We should strive for international participation in planning and content/presentation right from the start.
   * I agree September is a good time. 
   * We should approach big Python users in Bangalore (HP, Google, Dell etc) as possible sponsors.
   * Dates for forming a draft formal proposal ? - This is required for even approaching someone for sponsorship. I suggest creating one in 3 months. I can take the lead in this. Let me know who else will be interested in working on the proposal.
