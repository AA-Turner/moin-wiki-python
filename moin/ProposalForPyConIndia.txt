= Proposal for PyCon India =

PyCon is globally a community event. We intent to have an Indian Edition of the same, in association with BangPypers. The Idea is to have all the pythoneers around the country to come together have a good pythonic time and fun. The General Outline is something as follows:

 * Tutorials

 * General Talks

 * Workshops

 * Lightning Talks

 * Programming Sprints
  
 
== TODO List ==

 * Contact David Goodger of PSF to express the idea for an Indian edition of the conference, and for using the PyCon title. (Ramakrishna Reddy)

 * Write formal proposal
 * Find venue
 * Find Sponsors
 * Finalize Date -- 3 days (September)
    -- I suggest September 4,5,6 (Baiju M)
 * Form a planning committee
 * Budget ?
 * How to do Publicity
     -- Blog about it
     -- Buttons for websites/blog sidebars
     -- Inform in all mailing lists (User Groups) and keep posting reminders
     -- Publicize using other conferences/unconferences/events
 * Create one website with event details and co-ordinating proposals.  May be use the same code used by PyCon ?

= Community Discussion =

=== Anand B Pillai (abpillai at gmail dot com) ===

   * PyCon India should be a conference, not an unconference.
   * We should strive for international participation in planning and content/presentation right from the start.
   * I agree September is a good time. 
   * We should approach big Python users in Bangalore (HP, Google, Dell etc) as possible sponsors.
   * Dates for forming a draft formal proposal ? - This is required for even approaching someone for sponsorship. I suggest creating one in 3 months. I can take the lead in this. Let me know who else will be interested in working on the proposal.

=== Noufal Ibrahim (noufal at nibrahim dot net dot in) ===
  
   * I can get probably help to get a draft for the 'formal proposal' ready along with someone else. I think it should be possible to create a first draft in a week or so. If anyone has any pointers, please send them to me. 
   * Going to companies and advertising (including a website) would probably be predicated on the proposal.
   * +1 for September but we need to have some milestones set so that we can track it. There should be a point of no return. 

=== Parthan (python dot technofreak at gmail dot com) ===
   * +1 for September, but that means we have to start the publicity measures soon
   * We need a dedicated wiki/website up as soon as possible, this will help all information available at one place
   * Get international speakers to attract participation, but also give equal opportunity to Indian speakers
   * We should also involve all known companies who run as a python shop to increase the awareness within local communities.
