 * Silver Spring, Maryland USA 21-Jun-2011 2000UTC

= Tasks =

 * review Martin's branch {{{hg clone http://hg.python.org/features/pep-382}}}
   * look for reference counting issues
   * other initialization issues ({{{*foo = NULL}}})
 * do we have sufficient test coverage?
   * top-level non-trivial __init__.py
   * various reload scenarios
 * is {{{importlib}}} is covered?
 * pull down 3rd party pep 302 loader and see if/how it's broken
 * refactor import.c to yank out anything that can be written as a 302 loader?
   * --e.g. zip import-- Already done, but zipimport needs to support PEP-382
   * could land independently (but need to go through python-dev)
   * does this really make our lives easier?
 * attempt a merge of mvl's branch to trunk
 * figure out build problems on windows (jaraco)
 * test_imp gives one failure on fedora (make sure imp module has been updated)
