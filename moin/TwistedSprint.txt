= Twisted Sprint =

Twisted is too big and there are too many small groups of people who want to work on different things for a "Twisted Sprint" to be meaningful. There will be several mini-sprints involving improvements to the Twisted code base and related projects. 

== Potential mini-sprints ==

This is only a list of possibilities; if you can think of anything else that might belong here, or if you definitely plan on organizing your own Twisted mini-sprint, put it up here.

 * '''The 2.0 release:''' for planning and explaining details of Twisted's future architecture.
 * '''Twisted.web2:''' help with an enlightened rewrite of Twisted's HTTP server and client
 * '''Nevow:''' a powerful new templating and rendering engine for use with (or without) Twisted web servers

== Participants ==

Please add your name if you plan on coming to a Twisted-related sprint! If you don't know which mini-sprints you want to take part in, at least just put it at the end of this page.
