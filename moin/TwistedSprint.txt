=== PB ===

We need to make the changes to PB explained in: http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2002-October/001888.html

and the protocol change to jelly explained in: http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-January/002628.html

Replace code that uses __del__ with weakref based finalization.

Re-work connection API.

=== Bug fixes and design decisions ===

Process code has bugs (talk to Tv.)

Logging needs work.

=== Reality ===

We will probably have enough basic infrastructure stuff done by PyCon to be able to hack on an actual demo game during the sprint.

=== Coil ===

PyCon may be our only chance for getting Coil into a usable state in the foreseeable future. Hopefully we can tackle this.

''What about:''
 * Documentation -- I'd love to see comprehensive, up-to-date Woven docs ;)
 * Unit tests -- we always need more :)
