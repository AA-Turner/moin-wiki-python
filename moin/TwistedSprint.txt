Twisted is too big and there are too many small groups of people who want to work on different things for a "Twisted Sprint" to be meaningful. There will be several mini-sprints involving improvements to the Twisted and related code base. Tentatively, these will be the mini-sprints:

 * NewPB - (maybe) lead by BrianWarner. Probably a few days of this.
 * Reality - lead by ChristopherArmstrong. At least one full day of this.
 * Releasing automation - lead by ChristopherArmstrong. Is someone else willing to help me? :)
 * HTTP server (uploads, multi-headers, chunking, etc.) - lead by ItamarShtullTrauring
 * Lore - lead by GeorgePaci. More later after George finds out I added this ;-)
 * Rewrite tcp.py, add iovec - JP
 * Discuss PyProtocols

Please add your name if you plan on coming to a Twisted-related sprint! If you don't know which mini-sprints you want to take part in, at least just put it at the end of this page.
