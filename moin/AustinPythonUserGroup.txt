The Austin Python User Group was restarted in early 2006 on meetup.com.  As of September, we're moving to this wiki page and the [http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/apug scipy-hosted mailing list]. The meetup.com account has been paid through December so that it will keep pointing to this page while people make the transition.

Meetings are the second Thursday of each month at the [http://www.enthought.com/company/map.htm Enthought offices] at 7pm.  Snacks and drinks are provided.  Parking downtown can be tricky, though hopefully someone will post some tips here (particularly the details for parking in Enthought's garage.)
