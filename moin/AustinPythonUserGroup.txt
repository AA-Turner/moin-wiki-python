The Austin Python User Group (affectionately, APUG) was restarted in early 2006 on meetup.com.  As of September 2006, we've moved to this wiki page and the [http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/apug scipy-hosted mailing list].  There's also still a [http://python.meetup.com/188/ presence on meetup.com], since several folks have requested the Python meetup through that site.  We'll maintain both this wiki presence and the meetup until there's a clear winner.

Meetings are generally the second Wednesday of each month at the [http://www.enthought.com/company/map.htm Enthought offices] at 7pm.  The entrance to the building is on Congress; if the door is locked, you can press the intercom buzzer and tell the security guy that you're here to visit Enthought for the Python meeting.  He should let you in and make you sign in.

Enthought's office is on the 21st floor.  Once you enter the front door of the office, if there's no one there, proceed down the hallway to your right (do make the turns around corners!) and near the very end of the hallway, there will be a conference room, and we will be in there with the pizza and drinks.

Parking downtown can be tricky, though metered street spots are free at this time.  There are also a number of parking garages around, though I don't know the fee details.  515 Congress does have its own parking garage but usually the security gate is down for the night by the time of the APUG meeting so you can't get in.  If you do manage to get in, don't worry about getting out as you can always buzz the security guard to request the raising of the exit gate.
