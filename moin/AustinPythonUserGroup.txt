The Austin Python User Group (affectionately, APUG) was restarted in early 2006 on meetup.com.  This wiki page was used from parts of 2006-2009, but the meetup.com page is now the primary source for meeting announcements:

[[http://www.meetup.com/austinpython/|APUG meetup.com site]]

While there's still a [[http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/apug|scipy-hosted mailing list]], the [[http://www.meetup.com/austinpython/messages/archive/|meetup.com mailing list]] also receives some traffic.

Meetings are generally the second Wednesday of each month and held at the [[http://www.enthought.com/company/map.htm|Enthought offices]] at 7pm.  The entrance to the building is on Congress; if the door is locked, you can press the intercom buzzer and tell the security guy that you're here to visit Enthought for the Python meeting.  He should let you in and make you sign in.

Enthought's office is on the 21st floor.  Once you enter the front door of the office, if there's no one there, proceed down the hallway to your right (do make the turns around corners!) and near the very end of the hallway, there will be a conference room, and we will be in there with the pizza and drinks.

Parking downtown can be tricky, though metered street spots are free at this time.  There are also a number of parking garages around, though I don't know the fee details.  515 Congress does have its own parking garage but usually the security gate is down for the night by the time of the APUG meeting so you can't get in.  If you do manage to get in, don't worry about getting out as you can always buzz the security guard to request the raising of the exit gate.
