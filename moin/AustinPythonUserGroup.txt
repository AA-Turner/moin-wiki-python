The Austin Python User Group was restarted in early 2006 on meetup.com.  As of September 2006, we've moved to this wiki page and the [http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/apug scipy-hosted mailing list].

Meetings are generally the second Wednesday of each month at the [http://www.enthought.com/company/map.htm Enthought offices] at 7pm.  The entrance to the building is on Congress; if the door is locked, you can press the intercom buzzer and tell the security guy that you're here to visit Enthought for the Python meeting.  He should let you in and make you sign in.

Enthought's office is on the 21st floor.  Once you enter the front door of the office, if there's no one there, proceed down the hallway to your right and at the very end of the hallway, there will be a conference room, and we will be in there with the pizza and drinks.

Parking downtown can be tricky, though hopefully someone will post some tips here (particularly the details for parking in Enthought's garage.)
