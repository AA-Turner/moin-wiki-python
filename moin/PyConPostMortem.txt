This page is for use by PyCon organizers to 
to record learning experiences from this year's conference, and to remember things that we could do better next time.



= Ideas for next time =

 * When registering users, get permission to send them status e-mail (or to 
 put them on a mailing list).
 * When accepting proposals, request that users put their 
 presentations under one of the [http://creativecommons.org Creative Commons]
 licenses, as [http://zak.greant.com/archives/000622.html the MySQL conference has done.]

 * Do we need to use pycon.org?  

''I found having two copies of information irritating, and the limited number of people who could update the pages was a bottleneck at times.  Could we use the existing pydotorg CVS instead?  --amk''

= Tasks for next time =

 * Finish off and polish the conference software so that next year it doesn't have to
 be developed as capabilities are needed; having to do this resulting in our
 missing several promised deadlines and pushing things too close to the conference date.
 (AMK will do this. Please record ideas on [http://www.amk.ca/ng-arch/ConferenceSWIdeas this Wiki page], and join [http://www.amk.ca/mailman/listinfo/conf the conf mailing list] for discussion.)
