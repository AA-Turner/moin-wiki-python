This page is for use by PyCon organizers to 
to record learning experiences from this year's conference, and to remember things that we could do better next time.

A postmortem IRC session is scheduled for 1PM EST, Friday April 2nd.

= Statistics =

Pre-registered numbers: 340 attendees.

43 badges were never picked up.  

18 paid registrations on-site.


= Ideas for next time =

 * When registering users, get permission to send them status e-mail (or to 
 put them on a mailing list).
 * When accepting proposals, request that users put their 
 presentations under one of the [http://creativecommons.org Creative Commons]
 licenses, as [http://zak.greant.com/archives/000622.html the MySQL conference has done.]
 * Put Lightning Talk sessions (one or two of them) in the program.
 * Need more time between sessions

 * Do feedback forms on the web (e.g. Shane McChesney's offer)

 * Schedule first day of Open Space before conference -- first day had
 hardly any Open Space going

 * Put conference before sprint

 * Have Sprints before and after the conference

 * Make conference four days and sprint three days; last day of
 conference gears up for sprint

 * Do we need to use pycon.org?  

''I found having two copies of information irritating, and the limited number of people who could update the pages was a bottleneck at times.  Could we use the existing pydotorg CVS instead?  --amk''

''I'd rather use a Wiki whenever possible, or some system where people don't
have to ask to update pages -- lac''

 * Make sure that early bird registration deadline ends *after* all the papers have been
 accepted and the schedule has been created and posted for people to see.
 
 * Having the catering table in the back of the keynote room may not be a good idea; it's noisy
 when the staff refreshes the table in the middle of a talk.

= Tasks for next time =

 * Steve will chair one more conference; we need to arrange the succession for
 PyCon 2006.  Perhaps having a vice-chair closely involved in next year's planning process would be optimal.

 * Finish off and polish the conference software so that next year it doesn't have to
 be developed as capabilities are needed; having to do this resulting in our
 missing several promised deadlines and pushing things too close to the conference date.
 (AMK will do this. Please record ideas on [http://www.amk.ca/ng-arch/ConferenceSWIdeas this Wiki page], and join [http://www.amk.ca/mailman/listinfo/conf the conf mailing list] for discussion.)
