Nickname: merwok

I deeply enjoy programming with Python. My particular interests are the Web, XMPP, i18n, command-line interfaces, modular programs, GTK applications, and Mercurial. I like discovering elegant solutions and helping people.

I have a lot of projects but not enough time. I’ve started following an increasing number of Python bugs in the tracker, too. I hope I’ll be able to help. I like fixing boring stuff like typos, documentation or idioms.

I’m rather new to the community, so I’ve put up this page to introduce myself. I chat in the IRC room, I read a number of mailing lists, and check bugs in certain areas to see if I can help.

In real life, I am a student. This year, I’m taking part in the Summer of Code under the mentoring of C. Titus Brown to work on Distutils2 alongside four other students, three more mentors and the packager-in-chief Tarek Ziadé. I’m very happy to have been accepted and to work with these cool people. You can talk with us in #distutils on Freenode!

I’ll make a round of updating wiki pages about distutils and distutils2 after GSoC is over.
