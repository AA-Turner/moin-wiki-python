I deeply enjoy programming with Python. My particular interests are the Web, XMPP, i18n, command-line interfaces, and Mercurial. I like discovering elegant solutions and helping people.

I have a lot of projects but not enough time. I’ve started following an increasing number of Python bugs in the tracker, too. I hope I’ll be able to help.

I’m rather new to the community, so I’ve put up this page to introduce myself.

In real life, I am a student.
