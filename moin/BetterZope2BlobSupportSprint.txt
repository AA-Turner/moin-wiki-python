== Better Zope 2 Blob Support Sprint ==

At PyCon 2004, we came up with an interface that made it possible to quickly and
efficiently return read-only filelike data ("blobs") to viewers of Zope websites.
I'd like continue this work, attempting to come up with a sane API which would
allow us to persist pointers to bloblike objects into the ZODB and treat them
like files for both read and write operations (particularly while maintaining
transactional integrity for write operations).

**NOTE** This sprint may itself be folded into the ZodbSprint.

Please indicate your interest in this sprint by putting your name below
as well as the days that you'd be willing/able to attend!
