= Session Chair Signup =

Session chairs are responsible for introducing the speaker, and keeping the speaker to their time limit.  It's a fun job.  If you're going to be in the room for the talk anyway, you might as well sign up for the chair positio

Sign up is a pretty low tech affair for the time being.  Within the next few days we'll have a fancy app up to make everything all nice and clean.  In the meantime, if you'd like to chair any of these sessions, please edit the appropriate wiki cell like so: Really Great talk (Some person) (CHAIR: YOUR NAME youremail@whatever.com).

If you have any questions about this rather ad hoc process, email chris.mcavoy@gmail.com.
