**Registering as a PSF Board candidate**

To register as a candidate for the Board elections, add your nomination to this page using the format listed at the end of the page. We'd like as many groups within the PSF membership as possible to have the option of electing candidates that can directly represent their interests in Board discussions, so if there's someone you'd particularly like to have represent you, you may want to consider getting in touch with them and (politely!) asking if they'd be interested in nominating themselves. 

Read through the `Letter from PSF Director of Operations - Expectations of Board Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/ExpectationsOfBoardDirectors>`__ & `Duties and Responsibilities of Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/DutiesAndResponsibilitiesOfDirectors>`__. Please note that the PSF bylaws require that Board candidates disclose significant organizational affiliations (for example, their employer).

Lorena Mesa
=============

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Anna Ossowski)*

Anna: *I nominate Lorena Mesa for the PSF Board of Directors. Lorena’s passion for diversity outreach and education continue to fascinate me. Lorena has a "getting things done“- attitude and is very driven and energetic. Im confident that Lorena’s involvement in the PSF board would bring about positive change.*

**Lorena about herself, her involvement and goals:**

It is my intent to outline my personal conrtibutions to the Python community as well as the merits I would bring as a PSF as a new board member.

I've been using Python for eight years, professionally for two. My historical interest in Python lies in it being an ideal language to  teach, be the student a brand new coder or simply new to the language. 

As a founder and organizer for PyLadies Chicago, increasing the visibility of women in coding as well as offering other avenues for women to become coders are of the utmost concern to me. I believe that Python is a perfect language through which to achieve these goals due largely to the PSF's dedication to diversity. The PSF's efforts to provide diversity scholarships to PyCon as well as include more women speakers at PyCon has been an instrumental reason in why I originally became so involved in the Python community.

**2016/2017 Goals as a Board Member**

My goals for 2016/2017 as a board member would continue to build upon the work I've done as a PyLadies organizer and as a teacher. Namely my goals as a board member would be to:

* **Promote diversity:** Diversity without a question is a primary concern for me. I think historically we think of diversity as largely gender and race, but there is so much more to it than that. Namely age, national origin, and class. I think the PSF's support of PyLadies through the Grants Working Group have empowered me to become an active Python community member and has done great working in promoting gender diversity. I want to continue to promote the PSF's diversity initiative by becoming a member of the Grants Working Group and dedicate myself to working on diversity relentlessly and attempt to empower Python's diversity to include even younger coders and those from a broader population of national identities and class backgrounds. 

* **Broaden education initiatives:** I was excited to read a recent thread in the Education Working Group about the PSF potentially
