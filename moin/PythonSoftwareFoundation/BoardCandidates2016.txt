Lorena Mesa
=============

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Anna Ossowski)*

Anna: *I nominate Lorena Mesa for the PSF Board of Directors. Lorena’s passion for diversity outreach and education continue to fascinate me. Lorena has a „getting things done“- attitude and is very driven and energetic. Im confident that Lorena’s involvement in the PSF board would bring about positive change.*

**Lorena about herself, her involvement and goals:**

It is my intent to outline my personal contibutions to the Python community as well as the merits I would bring as a PSF as a new board member.

I've been using Python for five years, professionally for two. My historical interest in Python lies in it being an ideal language to  teach, be the student a brand new coder or simply new to the language. 

As a founder and organizer for PyLadies Chicago, increasing the visibility of women in coding as well as offering other avenues for women to become coders are of the utmost concern to me. I believe that Python is a perfect language through which to achieve these goals due largely to the PSF's dedication to diversity. The PSF's efforts to provide diversity scholarships to PyCon as well as include more women speakers at PyCon has been an instrumental reason in why I originally became so involved in the Python community.

**2016/2017 Goals as a Board Member**

My goals for 2016/2017 as a board member would continue to build upon the work I've done as a PyLadies organizer and as a teacher. Namely my goals as a board member would be to:

* **Promote diversity:** Diversity without a question is a primary concern for me. The PSF's support of PyLadies through the Grants Working Group have empowered me to become an active Python community member. I want to continue to promote the PSF's diversity initiative by becoming a member of the Grants Working Group and dedicate myself to working on diversity relentlessly.

* **Broaden education initiatives:** I was excited to read a recent thread in the Education Working Group about the PSF potentially expanding it's [outreach to high schools](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pythonedu-wg/2016-February/000049.html). Youth education is a passion of mine and something I often volunteer to do in my free time with free Python youth classes and organizing and mentoring DjangoGirls in Chicago and at various PyCons. Therefore I want to help support the Education Working Group as a group member.

* **Overhaul institutional infrastructure:** The changing face of the PSF has been fascinating for me to see and experience. What does it mean to be a foundation that supports the Python community and how can the PSF build a transparent organization that promotes it, these are the type of questions I want to contribute to. Governance is at best difficult but I am passionate about it. 

* **Build outreach in new areas:** I've been fortunate to travel to participate in PyCon USA, Django Under the Hood (Amsterdam), and DjangoCon Europe (Budapest). I will be participating in EuroPython this year and it is my hope to expand upon my Python travels by visiting Latin America. While traveling is one form of promotion for Python, I am dedicated to broadening the PSF's reach by finding other means of outreach. 

**My contributions to Python community:**

**As an organizer:**

* I founded PyLadies Chicago and primary organizer for the chapter. As primary organizer I work on big picture items like organizer recruitment, coalition building, and identify key areas for event planning.
* Coalition building with other Python groups in Chicago, specifically the Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy). We've teamed up to do coder dojos, a work night with specific learning goals with the end goal of maximizing PyLadies members in the ChiPy Python mentorship.
* Advancing Python OSS contributions. I organized through PyLadies Chicago a joint OSS Python workshop with Write/Speak/Code, a conference for women software engineers. I'm also championing the inclusion of Python OSS projects for the Write/Speak/Code 2016 conference.
* Primary organizer for DjangoGirls Chicago 2015 which included 50 students and over 30 mentors. 

**As a speaker and writer:**

* Speaker at PyOhio 2015, PyTennessee 2016, and upcoming speaker at EuroPython 2016.
* Editor for the upcoming O'Reilly's adaptation of Kenneth Reitz's The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python (written by Tanya Schlusser).

**As a teacher:**

* Volunteer and mentor for DjangoGirls Bilbao, DjangoGirls Budapest, DjangoGirls Montreal at PyCon 2015.
* Python teacher for Project Tech Teen Chicago, a free summer program for Chicago inner city youth that teaches coding.
* Girl Develop It Chicago Python teacher
* PyLadies Remote teacher 

In short, my passion for teaching and learning has driven me to become a Python organizer through PyLadies and now a speaker at Pythonconferences. Expanding outreach by promoting the values of diversity and inclusion are my primary goals I wish to accomplish as a PSF board member. By prioritizing these values the PSF has been at the edge of exciting new projects. As a board member I will work relentlessly, since that is something my passion drives me to do, and with great determination. I do not believe in doing something 50%, it is with a full effort that I always apply myself to the task at hand.

Thank you.

In solidarity,

Lorena Mesa

Trey Hunner
===========

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Anna Ossowski)*

Anna: *I nominate Trey Hunner for the PSF Board of Directors. Trey is truly passionate about Python education, welcoming new people into the Python community, and making the Python community a positive and friendly place for everyone. Trey is a huge supporter and contributor of various diversity initiatives, he is incredibly reliable, and always willing to help. Trey is a very valuable member of the Python community who would make an excellent addition to the PSF board.*

**Trey about himself, his involvement, and goals:**  *(To be added)*

Jackie Kazil
==============

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Anna Ossowski)*

Anna: *I nominate Jackie Kazil for the PSF Board of Directors. I am incredibly impressed with Jackie's leadership qualities. As chair of the PSF grants workgroup Jackie has driven the efforts of establishing a process for handling grant request over the past few months, which is an important area of work the PSF does. It is thanks to Jackie that the PSF is now able to process grant requests much faster and on a rolling basis. Jackie is always on top of things and it's a pleasure to work with her. I firmly believe that as a member of the PSF board Jackie will be able to drive a lot more positive change within the PSF.*


**Jackie about herself, her involvement and goals:**

I have three passions, passions that drive most of what I do in life, including the work that I do in the Python community.

1. Democracy
2. Diversity
3. Education

**Democracy**

Democracy means representing the people that elect you. This means being led with integrity and objectivity. I have an incredible drive for civic engagement. I am a trained journalist, which is a profession that seeks to empower the people that it serves.

**Diversity**

'Diversity' is often associated with gender and race, but diversity should be considered in the following terms (in no order of importance): gender, race, color, sexual preference, income, geography, national origin, differently abled, age, and family status.

The community needs to start taking a more active role in not just making individuals feel welcome, but inviting them into the community by directly reaching out.

**Education**

My mother, who risked her life to escape Communist Czechoslovakia said, "You can have everything taken away from you... your money, your home, the clothes on your back, but no one can take what is in your head."

My zest for educating others has been long standing. I am working to start two programs in the DC region that teach programming to folks that need skills training. Part of this is also helping with job placement after training.

**Summary**

I want to empower folks in the community to have their voices heard and institute and develop Python educational standards within the PSF.

**Things that I have done**
(specifically in the programming community)

* Founded PyLadies DC, which has helped seed future growth worldwide.
* Assisted in development on new PyLadies chapters.
* PyLadies auction organizer PyCon 2015
* PyLadies auction helper, Pycon 2014, 2013
* PyCon Keynote committee 2015
* Talk or tutorial reviewer for PyCon or Scipy 2013, 2014, 2015
* PyCon Speaker 2012, 2013, 2015
* Led accessibility hackathon - #allyhack 2015
* Leader of DCFemTech
* Teaches Python in the local community
* Former leader (now-coorganizer of Django District)
* Founder of GeoDC
* Teaches Python journalists through IRE/NICAR, PyJournos, and sometimes Hacks and Hackers
* Building a Python library w/ fiends  on Python library that does agent based modeling

Naomi Ceder
==============

*2015 Board Member*

I've been using, promoting and teaching Python on various levels for over 15 years as a
teacher, author, developer, manager, and organizer.

**My Contributions to the PSF in 2015/2016**:

* Co-created PSF Grants Working Group. The Grants WG is a step towards delegating some the PSF's decisions to a broader geographical group, and also gives more people experience in managing the PSF. The Grants WG has developed into a key resource in managing grants given to community events, having approved around $40,000 in grants.
* Assisted in interviewing for new role of PSF Infrastructure Manager.
* Actively supported the PSF's involvement in the BBC micro:bit project in the UK.
* Supported the creation of Python initiatives in Nigeria by helping get access to a mailing list, and advice on organization and grant requests; and Cameroon by coordinating with projects applying for PSF support.
* Gave keynotes at PyCon UK, PyCon Ireland, PyCon Poland
* Coordinated and co-presented 2015 EuroPython PSF members' meeting.
* Attended 16 out of 17 PSF board meetings.

**My goals for 2016/2017** as a board member would be to do all that I can to help the
PSF achieve its mission in any way that I can. In particular, I'm interested in:

* **Foster Diversity** - Diversity means more than increasing the numbers of women or nationalities (though both of those are important) - it involves thinking about a wide range of axes - race, ethnicity, disability, neurodiversity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, economic background, etc. I want to ensure that the Python community is as inclusive and welcoming as possible along all of those axes and more.
* **Develop New Leaders** - I believe that for an organization to be inclusive thought and effort must be put into opening all aspects to new people. My practice has been to deliberately hand off projects I've started as soon as practical once they are established, and I would view a board position the same way. I would also encourage and support a healthy turnover in board committee and working group leadership and membership, so that more people gain leadership experience.
* **Support Education** - Support for education is more than funding workshops - I'd like to encourage initiatives to improve pedagogy, tools, and resources for the various groups teaching Python, perhaps starting with a working group aimed at curricula and teaching resources.
* **Evolve PSF management** - As the community grows, the role of the PSF board needs to adapt. I will continue to support changes to make the PSF board have more of an oversight role and to develop other means to handle managerial and executive duties

**Background**:

* **Founded Trans*Code**, the first hackday series in Europe and UK to exclusively focus on issues of the transgender community
* **Keynotes and talks on Python, Diversity, and Community** at PyCon UK, PyCon PL, PyCon Ireland, ACE!Conf (Krakow, Poland), Write/Speak/Code 2016, EuroPython, PyCon US, PyLadies, and others.
* **PyCon organizer** - Co-chair of PyCon Sprints in 2015, 2016 and organized the PyCon Intro to Sprinting workshop; created/coordinated the first two education summits at PyCon; created/organized the poster session at PyCon for its first 3 years.
* **PyCon UK organiser** - Education Track Presenter at PyCon UK 2014; organising committee for PyCon UK 2015; created the first poster session at PyCon UK; Code of Conduct response team; Trans*Code at PyCon coordinator.
* **Author of The Quick Python Book, 2nd ed.** (3rd ed in preparation).
* Currently based in Chicago,II USA, but still involved with projects in the UK. Work with Python developers in USA, UK, Germany, Japan, China, Africa.

As a senior technical leader at a company that relies heavily on Python I'm very interested in
the long term health and growth of Python and the Python community. 

Finally, I take commitments to positions like this seriously - I
absolutely hate to miss meetings or deadlines, and I make sure tasks I'm assigned "just get done" with as little fuss as possible.

Philip James
============

*New Board Member.*

I use Python daily in both my professional and personal work, and regularly give talks and tutorials about Python. I've spoken about Python or Python-related projects at Django BarCamp 2014, PyCon 2015, PyDX 2015, DjangoCon EU 2016, and LinuxFest Northwest 2016. Additionally, I have volunteered with PyLadies, DjangoGirls, and DjangoCon US 2016.

My goals as a member of the PSF board would be:

* **Increase the diversity of our community:** To me, this means making sure anyone who wants to join finds the Python community to be a safe and welcoming space. It also means reaching out to people who don't think of themselves as "programmers", but who use Python or could benefit from using Python. (hat-tip to Jacob Kaplan-Moss for raising the idea of welcoming people who don't think of themselves as programmers)
* **Improve resources for existing python developers:** As an organization, we should be building on the work we do welcoming newcomers by making sure our community feels supported through every aspect of their time in our community. This means filling gaps in continuing education, making sure there are a plethora of Python-based career opportunities, and trying to support community members when they have non-technical human issues. (ie, issues around career choice, mental wellness, etc)
* **Make Python's real-world presence stronger:** For me, this means making sure every group in our community that wants to hold an event knows about our grants program, and that we help connect new and established groups with attendees, volunteers, and partners in our network. It also means making sure there is shared knowledge around running successful Python events, and that event organizers know how the PSF can support them. The quality and quantity of Python events should be ever-increasing.
