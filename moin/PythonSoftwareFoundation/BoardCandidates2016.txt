**Registering as a PSF Board candidate**

To register as a candidate for the Board elections, add your nomination to this page using the format listed at the end of the page. We'd like as many groups within the PSF membership as possible to have the option of electing candidates that can directly represent their interests in Board discussions, so if there's someone you'd particularly like to have represent you, you may want to consider getting in touch with them and (politely!) asking if they'd be interested in nominating themselves. 

Read through the `Letter from PSF Director of Operations - Expectations of Board Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/ExpectationsOfBoardDirectors>`__ & `Duties and Responsibilities of Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/DutiesAndResponsibilitiesOfDirectors>`__. Please note that the PSF bylaws require that Board candidates disclose significant organizational affiliations (for example, their employer).

.. note:: Please follow the instructions on the `<FrontPage>`__ to gain wiki edit access.

**Registering to vote on PSF ballots**

While PSF Membership is open to anyone that chooses to join, Basic Members are not entitled to vote on PSF ballots, including Board elections. In accordance with the bylaws, the following PSF Members are entitled to vote on PSF ballots:

* Managing Members
* Contributing Members
* Supporting Members (these were previously called "Associate Members")
* PSF Fellows
* Sponsor Delegates for Sponsor Members

To register as a Managing or Contributing member, refer to `this post <http://pyfound.blogspot.com.au/2015/02/enroll-as-psf-voting-member.html>`__ on the PSF blog.

To register as a Supporting Member, please use the `PSF Associate Membership site <https://psfmember.org/>`__.

PSF Fellows and Sponsor Members must themselves be approved through a PSF ballot, and thus only existing Fellows and Sponsor Delegates will be entitled to vote on the upcoming ballot.

 Description.

Naomi Ceder
==============

*2015 Board Member*

I've been using, promoting and teaching Python on various levels for over 15 years as a
teacher, author, developer, manager, and organizer.

**Board Accomplishments for 2015/2016**:

* Co-created PSF Grants Working Group. The Grants WG is a step towards delegating some the PSF's decisions to a broader geographical group, and also gives more people experience in managing the PSF. The Grants WG has developed into a key resource in managing grants given to community events
* Assisted in interviewing for new role of PSF Infrastructure Manager.
* Actively supported the PSF's involvement in the BBC micro:bit project in the UK.
* Supported the creation of Python initiatives in Nigeria by helping get access to a mailing list, and advice on organization and grant requests; and Cameroon by coordinating with projects applying for PSF support.
* Gave keynotes at PyCon UK, PyCon Ireland, PyCon Poland
* Coordinated and co-presented 2015 EuroPython PSF members' meeting.
* Attended 16 out of 17 PSF board meetings.

**My goals for 2016/2017** as a board member would be to do all that I can to help the
PSF achieve its mission in any way that I can. In particular, I'm interested in:

* **Foster Diversity** - Diversity means more than increasing the numbers of women or nationalities (though both of those are important) - it involves thinking about a wide range of axes - race, ethnicity, disability, neurodiversity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, economic background, etc. I want to ensure that the Python community is as inclusive and welcoming as possible along all of those axes and more.
* **Develop New Leaders** - I believe that for an organization to be inclusive thought and effort must be put into opening all aspects to new people. My practice has been to deliberately hand off projects I've started as soon as practical once they are established, and I would view a board position the same way. I would also encourage and support a healthy turnover in board committee and working group leadership and membership, so that more people gain leadership experience.
* **Support Education** - Support for education is more than funding workshops - I'd like to encourage initiatives to improve pedagogy, tools, and resources for the various groups teaching Python, perhaps starting with a working group aimed at curricula and teaching resources.
* **Evolve PSF management** - As the community grows, the role of the PSF board needs to adapt. I will continue to support changes to make the PSF board have more of an oversight role and to develop other means to handle managerial and executive duties

**Background**:

* **Founded Trans*Code**, the first hackday series in Europe and UK to exclusively focus on issues of the transgender community
* **Keynotes and talks on Python, Diversity, and Community** at PyCon UK, PyCon PL, PyCon Ireland, ACE!Conf (Krakow, Poland), Write/Speak/Code 2016, EuroPython, PyCon US, PyLadies, and others.
* **PyCon organizer** - Co-chair of PyCon Sprints in 2015, 2016 and organized the PyCon Intro to Sprinting workshop; created/coordinated the first two education summits at PyCon; created/organized the poster session at PyCon for its first 3 years.
* **PyCon UK organiser** - Education Track Presenter at PyCon UK 2014; organising committee for PyCon UK 2015; created the first poster session at PyCon UK; Code of Conduct response team; Trans*Code at PyCon coordinator.
* **Author of The Quick Python Book, 2nd ed.** (3rd ed in preparation).
* Currently based in Chicago,II USA, but still involved with projects in the UK. Work with Python developers in USA, UK, Germany, Japan, China, Africa.

As a senior technical leader at a company that relies heavily on Python I'm very interested in
the long term health and growth of Python and the Python community. 

Finally, I take commitments to positions like this seriously - I
absolutely hate to miss meetings or deadlines, and I make sure tasks I'm assigned "just get done" with as little fuss as possible.
