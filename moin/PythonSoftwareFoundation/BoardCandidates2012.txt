Steve Holden
============

*2011 Board Member.*

I have been a board member since 2004, and the board has elected me as chairman each year since 2008. I am seeking one final year of office as a director, during which I would like to consolidate the structural and financial changes I have made over the last few years to ensure the Foundation's long-term stability.

Van Lindberg
============

*New Board Member.*

(Nominated by Steve Holden.) I am a long-time Python user, having first started with version 1.4. Relative to the work of the PSF itself, I have been the PSF's legal counsel since 2007. 2012 will also be my fifth year working with the PyCon organizing committee; in 2008 and 2009 I ran sponsorship and publicity, and for the 2010-2011 cycle was the chair of PyCon US.

Tim Peters
==========

*2011 Board Member.*

I'm again running under the banner of the venerable Institutional Memory Party (I've served on the Board since its beginning).  I'm pleased with the Board's actions, and don't have ambitious visions for doing more.  That may not be exciting, but it helps keep the PSF solvent ;-)

Marc-Andre Lemburg
==================

*2011 Board Member.*

I've been board member in the years 2002-2004 and am again serving on the board since 2010.

Here's my 2011 agenda, with comments on progress:

* Starting with some real PR work for Python

 I started this in 2010 with the Python brochure project (see below).
   
* Giving the PSF a face at various important IT- conferences by sending delegates there to give talks, setup and run a booth, etc.
 
 This idea will hopefully pick up some speed once we have the brochure printed, since it'll provide a great starting point for booth discussions.
 
* Establishing the PSF as lobby organization in the political sphere in order to participate in projects where Python and its mindset can help, e.g. open-source, scientific and educational projects
 
 Due to regulations for 501(c)3 organizations, this idea will likely not be easy to implement. The PSF could indirectly play a role in this by putting more emphasis on funding other organizations which do lobbying work.
 
* Establishing and running services for the community, such as those needed for running small- to medium-sized conferences or meetings
 
 There hasn't been much progress in this area. The infrastructure team is currently working on a new PSF server infrastructure, which will hopefully make getting such services setup a lot easier.
 
* I hope to add a more a business-like mindset to the PSF board, in order to enable the PSF to mature both in terms of figures and responsibility.

 During the last two terms the board has become a lot more organized, so I think the board is moving in the right direction.

* Getting a web firm to give the python.org site a face-lift, make it more attractive for users (pupils, students, novices, developers, educational institutions, governments and businesses), donors and the press

 Jesse initiated the call for proposals to find a suitable web firm, so this is in good hands.

* Organizing fund raising in a professional way

 Jesse is currently doing a fantastic job with getting PyCon US sponsors lined up, so this is less pressing than it was in previous years.
   
During the last term, most of my energy went into the PR project to create a professional quality marketing brochure for Python which will help us get Python known outside the developer community. The project is moving forward steadily and making good progress - it did turn out to be a lot more work intense than we had expected, but it's fun to work with the team and we're all still very enthusiastic about the idea. I also worked on the trademark committee, monitored the PSF financials, initiated getting a PSF inventory list put together, and some other things I don't remember anymore ;-)

I'd like to continue with the work started in 2010 and look forward to another year serving on the board.
