Steve Holden
============

I have been a board member since 2004, and the board has elected me as chairman each year since 2008. I am seeking one final year of office as a director, during which I would like to consolidate the structural and financial changes I have made over the last few years to ensure the Foundation's long-term stability.

Van Lindberg
============

(Nominated by Steve Holden.) I am a long-time Python user, having first started with version 1.4. Relative to the work of the PSF itself, I have been the PSF's legal counsel since 2007. 2012 will also be my fifth year working with the PyCon organizing committee; in 2008 and 2009 I ran sponsorship and publicity, and for the 2010-2011 cycle was the chair of PyCon US.

Tim Peters
==========

I'm again running under the banner of the venerable Institutional Memory Party (I've served on the Board since its beginning).  I'm pleased with the Board's actions, and don't have ambitious visions for doing more.  That may not be exciting, but it helps keep the PSF solvent ;-)
