Thank you for considering the Python Software Foundation!

Being a board of director is a privilege and obligation to the Python community. Volunteer board of directors are the ambassadors of the Python Software Foundation and also of     the Python ecosystem. Their dedication and effort is countless and I am very thankful for the work that each of them have put into this Foundation. If you are considering running     for the 2016/2017 term, please review the expectations below. Please note that these listed expectations of a board director and not necessarily requirements for being voted on

Having Familiarity:
A good place to start for a new director is to read through our mission statement[1], our bylaws[2], and public records[3].

Partaking in discussions:
Being constructively active on the psf-board mailing list is beneficial and helps us move work along. This can include contributing to discussions related to requests and/or ways the PSF can improve processes. The board mailing list is a place all directors should feel comfortable to share their thoughts and ideas. 


Being active in furthering the PSF mission and its work:
This can include the Scientific Python Working Group, Grants Working Group, Infrastructure team, or by taking a lead volunteer position for PyCon 2017. If the member is comfortable with writing blog posts, they can contribute a few posts through out the year. When projects need special intervention or additional insight, it helps to have a board member step forward to help manage the project.

Representing the PSF:
Sometimes we get requests from PyCon conferences around the world for a keynote speaker. If the board director is comfortable giving talks, it is a great service to the PSF. If the director has a local user group, it is also great to help educate the user groups about the PSF and what it does. 

Attending board meetings:
Board meetings take once every two weeks, although this can vary depending on time of the year. The PSF handles more requests every year and it is important that the board      evaluates and votes on resolutions when possible. It is expected that a board member attend at least half of all meetings put on through out the term. When a director cannot         attend, they should send their proxy votes to the Director of Operations. Our meetings take place via phone and IRC/Slack.

If you have any questions about these expectations, please feel free to email me: ewa at python dot org.

Good luck!

Ewa Jodlowska
Director of Operations
