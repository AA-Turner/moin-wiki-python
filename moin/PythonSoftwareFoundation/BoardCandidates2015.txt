Marc-Andre Lemburg
==================

*2014 Board Member.*

I've been board member in the years 2002-2004 and then again since 2010.

PSF things I've been working on in 2014/2015:

* ran the `PSF Python Brochure project <http://brochure.getpython.info/>`__, which has so far been a great success by providing a nice tool for Python community members to promote Python; the first edition was available for PyCon 2014 in Montreal, the second for PyCon 2015;  also see the `PSF Python Brochure wiki page <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Python%20Brochure>`__

* continued worked with the `Python Events Calendars <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar>`__ team to run a central place where Python users can lookup Python events; calendars are shown on https://www.python.org/events/python-events/, http://www.pycon.org/ and also available as `map mashup <http://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/>`__.

* took the European `PSF Conference Kit <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Conference%20Kit>`__ to several conferences (EuroPython, FOSDEM, PythonCamp Cologne) to show PSF support; created new carry-on displays for StephaneWirtel to use for Python events in Belgium and France.

* created and sent out `giveaway marketing material <https://wiki.python.org/psf/Merchandise>`__ for use at Python conferences and by user groups (flyers, stickers)

* promoted the PSF at conferences in Europe, giving `talks <https://wiki.python.org/psf/MembershipModelTalks>`__ and available as contact for people interested in the PSF (EuroPython, PyCon UK, PyCon DE, FOSDEM, PythonCamp Cologne)

* managed the central `PSF domain management <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Domains>`__ account at Gandi.net, transferred and registered more domains to that account

* created and managed the central `PSF SSL certificate management <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20SSL%20Certificates>`__ accounts at StartSSL and Gandi.net

* administered the `Python, Jython and PSF wiki systems <https://wikis.python.org/>`__ together with the volunteers on the `pydotorg-www mailing list <pydotorg-www@python.org>`__, helped setup the new editors scheme to prevent wiki admin burnout due to very frequent spamming and vandalism of the wikis.

* administered the http://www.pycon.org/ page and the pycon.org DNS record (which I've owned from 2003-2012 before contributing it to the PSF

* ran the `new Python Job Board team <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PSF%20Python%20Job%20Board>`__ together with initially 30 volunteers; pushed for jobs app implementation changes and worked on the final ones to be able to finally `launch the new Python Job Board on 2015-03-19 <http://pyfound.blogspot.de/2015/03/psf-python-job-board-relaunched.html>`__

* contacted new potential PSF sponsors as part of creating a more `diverse PSF marketing strategy <https://wiki.python.org/psf/Board/marketing-psf>`__

* built closer relationships with the `Raspberry Pi Foundation <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`__, getting joint blog posts running and investigating possible closer collaboration on education workshops

* a lot of the above relates directly with my PSF work to create `closer ties with the Python community <https://wiki.python.org/psf/Community%20Relations>`__

in addition to the usual PSF board and `trademark committee <https://wiki.python.org/psf/TrademarksCommittee>`__ work.

Things I'd like to focus on for 2015/2016:

* integrate the PSF more into the global Python community and make it's organizational structures more diverse and international

* make more use of the new PSF work group setup and work out the organizational details for this

* push for getting the python.org website setup with a real CMS in order to attract more content contributors and maintainers

* create a marketing work group to (a) develop a more diverse marketing strategy for Python which doesn't only focus on developers, (b) create more marketing material and tools to enable Python user groups and evangelists to better promote Python in their local and professional settings, and (c) create more `Python merchandise <https://wiki.python.org/psf/Merchandise>`__

* rewrite the `Python trademark policy <https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/>`__ to make it more readable and straight forward

* get the PSF to adopt `more community friendly PyPI terms & conditions <https://bitbucket.org/malemburg/pypi-terms/src/9148ddefb40fa84e8c0ffaad055bd1fc6f333900/pypi-terms.md?at=default>`__

* if we can get PSF funding, help create a second volume of the `PSF Python Brochure <http://brochure.getpython.info/>`__

I'd like to continue my work as director and look forward to another year serving on the board.

Other Python community projects I'm involved in:

 * `EuroPython Society (EPS) <http://www.europython-society.org/>`__ - I'm a board member of the EPS, which is the organization running the `EuroPython <http://europython.eu/>`__ conference series; this uses a `work group structure <https://ep2015.europython.eu/en/volunteers/>`__ similar to the one the PSF wants to use, but we actually have it working already for the 2015 edition

 * `Python Meeting Düsseldorf (PyDDF) <http://pyddf.de/>`__ - Together with Charlie Clark, I started a local Python user meeting series in Düsseldorf in 2012; we're having quarterly meetings with talks, discussions; videos are available in our `PyDDF YouTube Channel <https://www.youtube.com/pyddf/>`__
