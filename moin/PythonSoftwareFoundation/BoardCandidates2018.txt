Anna Ossowski
=============

*2015-2016 Former Board Member. (Nominated by Trey Hunner)*

Trey: *I nominate Anna Ossowski for the PSF Board of Directors. Anna is both a friendly member of the Python community who inspires action. I served on the PSF board of directors for two years partly thanks to Anna encouraging me to run. Anna lends a helping hand to many through speaker mentorship, PyLadies remote organizing, and community outreach work. I think Anna would once again make a great addition to the PSF board of directors.*

**Anna about herself, her involvement, and goals**:

Background
-------------

In 2014 I attended my very first PyCon US in Montreal. I was new to Python and didn’t know anyone in the community. Fast forward to 2018, and I now work in tech full time (Developer Relations at Elastic), have spoken at number of tech conferences, mentor new speakers in my free time, started and co-organize PyLadies Remote, have organized a number of Django Girls workshops, am the Diversity Chair of DjangoCon US, and Open Spaces Advisor and Mobile Guide Coordinator of PyCon US. I am passionate about diversity and inclusion, and recently started sharing my mental health journey in hopes of helping others. 

I love the Python community with all my heart and owe everything (both personal and professional) to this community. I was fortunate to serve the Python community as a member of the PSF Board of Directors in 2015/16 (co-founded the Grants Working Group with Naomi Ceder). I took an intentional break for 2 years and would be delighted to serve the community again.


Goals
------

* **Grants** - I co-founded the Grants Working group with Naomi Ceder in 2015 and would love to help the group function more efficiently by re-thinking current processes and documenting them.

* **Transparency** - The PSF has done a great job becoming more transparent over the past few years. I believe there is more work to be done and would be happy to drive transparency efforts to the next level.

* **Marketing** - There are many members of our community who don’t know exactly what the PSF does and how they can get more involved. I would love to develop a marketing plan in order to educate members of the Python community and increase community engagement.

* **Community Outreach** - I believe that listening to the community and their needs is important. I want to make myself available to the community and offer community office hours on a weekly basis.

* **Code of Conduct** - The Python community is known for being one of the friendliest and most welcoming tech communities. In order to keep our community a safe and friendly place for everyone, it is necessary that we continue working on Code of Conduct policies and actionable enforcement plans. It is very important to me to get involved in the Code of Conduct working group and help create these policies and plans.

Christopher Neugebauer
======================

*New Board Member.*

Background
----------

I’m an Australian Python developer, speaker, and serial conference
organiser. These days, I'm based in Petaluma, California, USA.

I’ve been closely involved in PyCon Australia for many years,
including as a lead organizer, and also as their lead for outreach and
inclusion. During this time, PyCon Australia grew from 240
attendees to upwards of 600, and the financial aid we’ve been able to
offer has grown to $20,000 (or close to 10% of the total conference
budget).

I'm director of North Bay Python, a Python conference based in
Petaluma, north of the San Francisco Bay. Running on a shoestring
budget, we built a conference – from the ground up – that delivers
on the Python community's values of inclusion and diversity: in our
first year, we paid out more than 25% of our budget in outreach and
inclusion activities, and more than 40% of our speakers were not men.

I’ve served as a Council Member for Linux Australia, an organisation
that provides financial, legal, and technical support for open
source-related conferences including PyCon Australia. In that role, I
helped to develop and implement a policy for making sure our events
are run in a sustainable fashion, and made sure that Linux Australia
continued to be a healthy organisation.

Since 2015, I’ve served on the PSF’s Grants Working Group. We’ve
helped substantially grow the PSF’s capacity to offer grants to
important Python projects throughout the world. In my role in that
working group, I've taken a strong interest in guiding policy around
the PSF's ability to support events and causes that help promote the
PSF's mission throughout the world.


What I want to get done
------------------------

Through the PSF's grants program, we've done some great work making
Codes of Conduct an expected part of Python events throughout the
world, but this is only one step in promoting the PSF's mission of
growing a `diverse and international community of Python
programmers <https://www.python.org/psf/mission/>`_.

The PSF has other means to promote diversity, through their trademarks
and grants policies, and I've been working in this space within the
PSF for some time now. I think now's the right time for me to promote
this at a board level: we need to establish diversity and inclusion
targets for all events that seek our support, and *we can achieve
this now*.

Secondly, the PSF needs sustainable funding beyond PyCon US, and the
Python community needs more events than just PyCon US. The PSF can
play a vital role in empowering people who want to run local events,
and this can provide both a vital revenue source for the PSF, and a
more diverse set of events to grow our community.

In summary, this is what I hope to achieve in my first year:

- Work at strengthening the PSF's policies around grants and
  trademark licensing, to ensure that events aligned with the
  PSF work in support of the PSF's mission
- Build the PSF's capacity for fiscal sponsorship to empower
  the community to run projects through the PSF, and raise funds
  for the PSF
- Help identify diverse sources of funding for the PSF, to reduce
  our reliance on PyCon US's success to deliver the remainder of
  the PSF's goals

Katie McLaughlin
================

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Trey Hunner)*

Trey: *I nominate Katie McLaughlin for the PSF Board of Directors. I have witnessed Katie enthusiastically greet new community members at conferences and patiently shepherd first-time open source contributors during BeeWare sprints. Katie is a concerned and compassionate Python community member. Katie wears many hats but also seems to have a good understanding of her own boundaries, both qualities that are helpful for PSF directors.*

I have worked behind the scenes on various Python and open source events and conferences around Australia for the past few years (See “Background”), and have recently applied the knowledge gained from those experiences by taking on the leading role in coordinating such events, and serving on foundation boards. 

I have an active role as a Director of the Django Software Foundation, and should I be elected to the Python Software Foundation board, I can act as a conduit between these two groups, sharing knowledge and ideas. 

I am based in Australia, which is a country with it’s own thriving Python community currently unserved by a Director on the Python Software Foundation board in this geographic region. I am aware of the logistical complexities by adding a member from UTC+10, but I will be able to mitigate this via attending meetings out of hours, asynchronous communication, and remote voting, if required.

Younggun Kim
============

*2016/17 Board Member.*

It was an honor to served as the first Board Director elected from East Asia. I brought the voices from the east part of our community to the board. I traveled as many PyCons in South/East Asia as I can just to show them we are one big community all around the world and to help them organize their own PyCon. I gave talks, organized development sprints, brought the PSF conference kit all by myself and put up the PSF booth at almost every PyCon in East Asia. So that I can present the PSF in neglected area of our community. In the result of their desire and the effort, Indonesia and Thailand have their first PyCon and I'm not going to stop here. We still have a lot more community members living in developing countries and I'd love to go there and help them as a representative of the PSF as I have been done so far.

Paola Katherine Pacheco
===========================

*2017 Board Member.*


**Description**

Hi, I'm Paola Katherine, I'm Software Engineer, I work with Python because of the community that hosted me with Pyladies and with Python Brazil. I believe that without the knowledge and help of the community today I would not work with development.
As I lived in Brazil for a long time I suffered a bit of prejudice and without the support of the community I would have given up.
From the moment I started in the area, I've always tried to help everyone who wants to learn by focusing on women to understand the prejudice they suffer, but I've always intended to help those who want to learn, as well as Python's behavior. community.
With that I got involved with events, thus reaching more people.

I believe that today Latin America in general needs attention in education, is in a process of transition, a new generation that is now learning technology, that is learning English, that has interest but in many countries still suffers a patriarchal culture that does not sees the woman working and also a technological backwardness.

Today I live in Argentina, where there is a delay and we do not have many companies here.
Because of this I created an event called + CON, a free event, where the focus is students. Where the goal is to present the few companies that we have here to the students, so that they can get a job.


**History of contributions to the community:**
 * Organization of the first Django Girls Rio de Janeiro
 * Django Girls Python Brazil 2016 organization, Florianópolis, the largest in Brazil.
 * Participation in the Pyladies Brasil community
 * Participation in the Pyladies community Rio de Janeiro
 * Creation of Pyladies Mendoza
 * Creation of the Mendoza Python community
 * Organization of Django Girls Pycon Colombia, where I just organized remotely until I found a Colombian who could lead with that after the event a Python community was created in Cali, Colombia.
 * Volunteer at Pycon Colombia
 * Speaker at Pycon Argentina and Euro Python to talk about community and diversity.
 * Organization of the Django Girls Euro Python, event where I organized alone and remotely, going only in the day. It was an event where we had problems in previous years and we had the success of getting tickets for all participants.
 * Creation of a conference focused on students and aimed at the diffusion of open source. Rio DevDay was the largest conference in Rio de Janeiro, with 311 people, 18% women and 40% students / people who never had the opportunity to work with technology.
 * Creating videos teaching python for beginners, to contribute to those who do not have much knowledge of English. Also helping anyone who is starting out and trying to be a female inspiration to the girls who are just getting started.
 * Volunteer at Pycharlas - Spanish track at Pycon Cleveland 2018
 * Creator of +CON, a free conference aimed at students where the goal is to bring students to the area of technology.


**My goals for 2018/2019 as a board member:**:

**Promoting diversity:** I would like to boost the issue of diversity in Latin America, we still need to include issues such as women, race, color. Since I lived in Brazil, which was much more ahead of other Latin American countries, we had problems with regard to female inclusion, and today in Argentina I see that the problem is a little more serious, perhaps because of cultural issues. I raise the Pyladies flag which encourages a lot of girls and minorities to be included.
 
**Promote the increase of knowledge:** By having another language, Latin America
In relation to the rest of the world for many times ends up falling behind.
I would like to encourage conferences, dissemination of knowledge, leverage this curious audience, students, to anyone who wishes to have this knowledge that often can not, due to lack of access to information.

**I have a project in progress**, a project for the secondary, where I want to teach about basic programming. From hardware to object orientation. I want to teach from basic knowledge to the minimum so that they can get jobs, or internships.

Thea Flowers
============

*New Board Member.*

**Description**

I owe my career to the Python language and community. I come from a non-traditional background and finding a language as approachable as Python with a community that is open and inclusive empowered me to build a life for myself. I am approaching my first decade as a professional engineer and I would like to give back to the community that brought me here in a more significant way.

My true calling in life is *Developer Relations* - a role that combines engineering, writing, and empathy to accelerate the growth of communities and empower people from all backgrounds to use code to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. I want to use this perspective and skill set to support and grow the Python ecosystem.

I have spent the last 3 years working with the community via the Python Packaging Authority and urllib3. I have been the primary maintainer of packaging.python.org for the last year. I want to continue and expand these efforts. If elected, here's what I would like to focus on:

* Infrastructure and packaging: As part of work with the PyPA, I’ve seen how investments in infrastructure and packaging projects such as Warehouse can have a huge multiplying effect. I want to support additional investments through the infrastructure and packaging working groups to provide the community with an even better experience when it comes to sharing and using code.
* Outreach and diversity of core contributors: I want to empower more people from more backgrounds to become core contributors. I have been inspired by the work of Mariatta in this area. I want to become a core contributor myself, share my experience, and create, support, and participate in workshops, sprints, and hackathons to help others contribute to our documentation and the core language.

You can find me at https://thea.codes and https://github.com/theacodes.

Jeff Triplett
=============

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Trey Hunner and Anna Ossowski)*

Trey: *I nominate Jeff Triplett for the PSF Board of Directors. Jeff is passionate about pushing Python spaces to new heights of inclusivity and sustainability. Jeff has given me an enormous amount of actionable feedback in regards to Python/Django community work since nearly the day I met him. Jeff has a tendency to give constructive feedback and to follow through with his words through action.*

Anna: *I nominate Jeff Triplett for the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors. Jeff is an active and engaged member of our community. He has made a tremendous impact on the Django community through his involvement in the organization of DjangoCon US and the Django Software Foundation Code of Conduct committee. Jeff possesses a leadership mentality and “getting things done”- attitude, is passionate about diversity and inclusion, and is an incredibly caring and driven person. I am confident that Jeff’s involvement in the PSF board would bring about positive change.*

**Jeff about himself, his involvement, and goals**:

Background
-------------

I’m Jeff, a Python/Django developer living in Lawrence, KS. Before I
became a consultant seven years ago, I worked for one of the newspaper
startups which originally made Django. I first attended PyCon US and
DjangoCon US back in 2008, and I have been in love with this community
ever since.

I organized my first two conferences in 2015 and it opened my eyes to
how much work was still needed to make our community more inclusive,
diverse, and accessible; achieving those goals has been part of my core
values ever since. Everything I have learned I owe to someone who took
the time and had the patience to work with me and I strive to pay that
forward.

I am a firm believer in the Campsite Rule, “Always leave the campground
cleaner than you found it.” It guides my community work and committee
involvement. I believe I have done that for the Django community while
making a lasting positive impact on many, and I’d love to contribute to
doing the same in the Python community.

Goals
-----

-  *Transparency* - The PSF has made progress in becoming more
   transparent, but people tend to distrust what they do not understand.
   I would like to help fill in the gaps between how some things work,
   why they work that way, and how they are perceived to work so that
   others in our community may understand them better.

-  *Code of Conduct* - One of our top priorities should be to get the
   Code of Conduct working group up and running. Having a working Code
   of Conduct committee or working group has paid dividends to the
   Django community. The PSF requires that conferences and events have a
   code of conduct in place before they may obtain funding, which I
   applaud. However, requiring a CoC without having an actionable
   working group falls short in keeping our community safe. I have
   served on Django’s CoC committee and taken incident reports as a
   conference organizer, so I have a practical understanding of the work
   that’s needed.

-  *Sustainability* - The PSF needs financial sustainability independent
   of PyCon US to prevent bad years from having a significant negative
   impact. We also should focus on sustaining the Python infrastructure
   and the Packaging Workgroup, which is critical to the Python
   ecosystem. Having worked on the DSF’s fundraising proposal (which we
   loosely modeled off of the Node.js Foundation’s membership levels), I
   have insight into what it takes to achieve financial health including
   networking with sponsors.

-  *Regional Conference Support* - The Python community has an
   incredible network of regional conferences whose organizers work
   together to share ideas, learned experiences, values, and our shared
   network for promoting CFPs and announcements. I never realized the
   lack of available resources for new conferences until many reached
   out to DjangoCon US for advice and help. Exploring ways of supporting
   regional conferences in sharing resources would contribute to the
   PSF’s goals of sharing knowledge, encouraging contributors, and
   welcoming new community members.

Marc Garcia
===========

*New Board Member.*

Academic and professional background
------------------------------------

Computer engineer with master degrees in AI and finance. More than 15 years professional
IT experience mainly in Python, first focused on web development, and later in data science.
Worked for companies like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Unilever, Tesco and NTT Communications.

Python background
-----------------

I discovered Python in 2006, and really loved the language, mainly for its readability and for
its "batteries included". It made me much more productive than any other language, and who doesn't
like that. Same happened a bit later with Django.

As it was hard to find a Python job in Barcelona (my home town) at that time, I started freelancing,
and specialized in web development, the main market for freelancers. I used Django for many years, I
maintained the Spanish and Catalan translations, I authored and maintained few plugins (django-stdimage
and django-transmeta being the most popular). And I made several contributions to the project, including
a `refactoring of Django localization system
<https://datapythonista.blogspot.co.uk/2009/04/gsoc-implementation-of-additional-i18n.html>`_, as part
of a Google summer of code scholarship in 2009. During that time I was a regular attendee of the Barcelona
Python meetup, and I was the administrator of the distribution list of Python and Django in Catalan.

In 2012, I took a break of professional programming to study a master degree in artificial intelligence,
and after that I spent one year in a business school.

In 2015 I came back to use Python professionally, this time as a data scientist. I spent some time mastering
the Python data libraries, and after some time I started to get involved with the community again. First by
creating the Mallorca Python meetup, and then the PyData Mallorca. In summer 2017 I volunteered as a NumFOCUS
ambassador, representing the foundation in different conferences like EuroPython.

After moving to London, I found that the Python community was very healthy, with user groups meeting often,
with great talks, excellent networking, and some programming sessions, mainly in the London Python coding dojo,
one of the best Python user groups I know. But I found that it wasn't much about contributing to the open
source projects (Python itself or the many libraries). With this in mind, I decided to start the London Python
sprints group. To encourage and mentor people in their way to contribute to Python open source projects.

The London Python sprints group has more than 750 members, we hosted around 20 sprints, and I estimate we sent
more than 100 pull requests to different Python projects, since we started in August 2017.

During this time, I was also the main organizer of the `#pandasSprint
<https://datapythonista.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/pandassprint-write-up.html>`_, a join event between our group
and 30 other Python user groups. The goal was to help improve the pandas API documentation. We estimated that
around 500 people participated in the event in diverse locations such as Korea, China, India, Turkey, Nigeria,
Brasil, Argentina and many places in the US and Europe. Around 300 pull requests related to the sprint were
sent to pandas in the day of the sprint and the few days after.

PUGs I attend with certain regularity: London Python sprints (organizer), London Python Coding Dojo, PyData
London, London Python meetup.

Python conferences I attended: PyCon US, EuroPython, DjangoCon, PyCon UK, PyCon PL, PyData London, PyData
Amsterdam, PyData Madrid, PyData Barcelona.

My vision
---------

While I arrived to the Python community because of the technical aspects of Python and its libraries, I really
think that Python is much bigger than it. I like to think on how the world would be if it was based on the same
values as the Python community. A place were diversity is one of the most valuable assets. Were people is valued
by who they are, regardless of their gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation, religion, physical
appearance... A world were kindness comes always by default, and helping and empowering others is a common practice
when possible. A world with no tolerance for harassment of any kind.

I would love to live in a world like this. I'm very proud of all the people who made the Python community a
micro-world with this principles. And I'm very happy and thankful to be able to be part of it.

If elected as a director of the Python Software Foundation, I will do my best, not only to promote, protect and advance
Python and its environment, but to make sure we preserve the values that make our community extraordinary and unique.

Nina Zakharenko
===============

*New Board Member.*

I've been involved with the Python community for 5 years. I attended PyCon US 2013 as my first tech conference, and I was so impressed with the community that I quit my job as a Java developer and decided to focus on Python instead. I haven't looked back since!

I took over a year off from contributing back to the Python community due to workplace demands, but now I’m fortunate enough to work in an organization that supports me and allows me the time and energy to involve myself in community work. I'm excited to use this opportunity to contribute to a community that I know and love.

Background
----------
 
I've spent the past few years preparing talks for the community both at a local Meetup level, and at Python conferences all around the globe. This year I'm coordinating with the organizers of PyLadies PDX (Portland, OR USA) teach intermediate and advanced Python workshops in the Fall of 2018.

I've been fortunate enough to consider others in the community as mentors, and I’ve followed their example by offering one-on-one mentorship to underrepresented members of our community. In the past, I've also spent time mentoring junior developers and encouraging their contribution to open source projects, and volunteered once for the talk selection committee for PyCon US.

I've spoken at the following Python events:

 * PyCon Canada 2013 - Lightning talk
 * DjangoCon 2014 - 2 talks - (1) Angular JS + Django, A Perfect Match (2) Django REST API - So easy you can learn it in 25 minutes
 * PyCon US 2015 - Technical Debt - Code Monster in Your Closet
 * PyCon US 2016 - Memory Management in Python - The Basics
 * PyCon Russia 2017 - Keynote
 * PyCon Canada 2017 - Elegant Solutions for Everyday Python Problems
 * PyCon US 2018 - Elegant Solutions for Everyday Python Problems

I've also presented workshops and talks at local Meetups, such as Girl Develop It! Salt Lake City, The Salt Lake City Python Meetup, and the Montreal Python Meetup. I'm a published author of screencasts on Frontend Masters, and Pluralsight.

My Goals
--------

My goals as a PSF board member center around the core values of mentorship, diversity, and inclusion.

* **Code of Conduct** - PyCon US has been at the forefront of crafting conferences that foster diversity and creating an inclusive space for attendees. But, as our community grows, our Code of Conduct can't remain static. I plan to support initiatives and groups to improve the PSF and PyCon Code of Conduct policies.
* **Increase opportunities for community mentorship** - The Python Core Mentorship initiative is a great start. I’d like to use the resources and reach of the PSF to help grow the program, increase awareness of it among underrepresented groups in our community, and implement better solutions for connecting mentors with mentees. 
* **Increase the diversity of speaker lineups at regional Python events.** - PyCon US has made great strides towards having an increasingly diverse speaker lineup, but regional events still struggle. I think it's important that the speaker lineup at events reflect our commitments. To that note, I'd like to help grow the diversity of speakers at all of our conferences. First steps would involve creating resources for potential speakers, facilitating connecting new speakers with community mentors, and working with regional conferences to ensure that their Code of Conduct, CFP, and other practices encourage a speaker lineup that reflects the diversity of our community.

These are just a few of the ways I think my involvement can make the Python community better, stronger, and more inclusive. I can't wait to work with others who share the same passion.

Mario Corchero
==============

*New Board Member*

Background
----------

I am a Spanish Python and community passionate living in London with a lot of energy that wants to push the PSF forward.
I am currently working with the PSF as an organiser of PyConCharlas - a Spanish track at PyCon- and PyLondinium - an event in support of the PSF to raise funds. I am vice president of the Python Spain association and Chair of PyConES17. I've been involved and drive the organization of sprints and meetups, mainly in London, where I also and helped the PSF with some other events like Startup Row. I've spoken in multiple conferences like PyCon, EuroPython, FOSDEM, PyConUK and PyConES and I have `sporadically contributed to cpython <https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Amariocj89+org%3Apython>`_. I am also starting to blog some `Python content at opensource.com <https://opensource.com/users/mariocj89>`_.
Within Bloomberg, I am a Python advocate, organising internal meetups of around 100 people monthly and deliver training and tutorial to new hires and people new to Python at Bloomberg.

My core objectives as a board member
------------------------------------

**Local events and association cookbooks**: Creation of manuals like the existing for `django girls <https://organize.djangogirls.org/>`_ and `pyladies <http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/>`_ for general purpose local associations and collaboration with Lorena Mesa to finish and consolidate the one for `events <https://github.com/lorenanicole/pycon_organizers_manual>`_. I'd like to see a single entry page where we can list all documentation for events and association organisers. The target language will be English but ideally, we will get it translated into Spanish as well to foster the creation of associations in other Spanish speaking countries.

Objective: to facilitate the creation of new association and local events.

**Issues only repository**: Issues only repository where the PSF and its related project runners (example pypa or cpython) can post help needed for their projects or actions. There are multiple uses of this: It can be used to provide transparency if we decide to use it as a way to document PSF work, it can help volunteers get involved in PSF related projects by having a place where they can look for volunteering work, companies looking to get more involved in supporting Python projects can use it as well if as an example pypa is looking to organise a Sprint. This can also be expanded into a way for the community to propose ideas to the PSF (by creating issues).
If desired this can be connected with the existing volunteering mailing list.

Objective: to raise the involvement of the community with the PSF and its duties.

**Trainer Board**: Given the success of the Jobs section in the python web, explore the creation of a trainers board where people and companies can offer training services. Individuals and companies can offer their services under a "generic" description and allow seekers of training to reach out to them.

Objective: Get in touch trainers with companies in need of them to ease Python adoption.

**Creation of a company working group**: Python is clearly `one of the preferred langauges <https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/>`_ but even if many individuals acknowledge Python as their preferred languages companies need support and might not be fully bought into the language. We should consider the creation of a working group that will assist company by pointing them to trainers, success stories, resources, reasons of why to use or move to Python and support the PSF in their objective of promoting the Python language. Ideally, this will be a bidirectional channel, offering the PSF a way to further involve companies that would like to support our community.

Objective: Foster the use of Python by companies and support their questions and needs by creating long-term informal collaboration plans.

**Why Python**: Even if `the applications <https://www.python.org/about/apps/>`_ section contains information about Python libraries and frameworks we should have a section about why Python should be the choice in fields like Data Science, education, web development, software development tooling, server-side development, etc. This will be a way to arm developers and people willing to introduce Python into their companies and can be used by the company working group. This is key when other languages are well supported by a company and experts on those can easily block the introduction of new technologies and tools. This will be a way for people to easily defend the position of why Python is a good choice.

Objective: Ease the introduction of Python in companies still not using it by providing compelling arguments.

**PyLondinium**: Continue organisation PyLondinium as a way to provide extra founds to the PSF and eventually see if this idea can be mirrored into other locations.

Objective: Increase the founding of the PSF.

This are my personal objectives for the term of the next board, but I also commit to the general goal of the PSF and the other tasks that arise on the time if I am elected. Also, if you have any question, feel free to reach out to me at mariocj89 [at] gmail [dot] com.

Sergey Sokolov
==============

*New Board Member.*

Description
------------

Hi, I'm Sergey. I'm a Web Developer and PiterPy Meetup organizer from Saint Petersburg, Russia.

I'm quite new to the Python ecosystem, I'm running a local meetup with my fellow Pythonistas for a half a year so far, but from what I think we've achieved quite a lot already — we are helping the local Django Girls to run their second workshop in Saint Petersburg; we got thousands of views and lots of reactions to our event against Telegram ban in Russia dedicated to freedom of speech; we get a number of companies to help and invert in the community; and finally, together with SPb Python User Group we built a nice, warm and helpful group of people around Python.

Lately, I got myself involved in the PSF community via mailing lists, Twitter and the Events Calendar team, and from where I stand it seems to be full of beautiful, devoted and loving people. Therefore, I decided to try and step up my commitment instead of silently like tweets right and left :)

I feel like developers from Russia and CIS are rather underrepresented in the today's international Python community and what I'd love to achieve here is to get more people to learn about PSF and it's mission, to have them involved and to say their opinions out loud. To get people from small cities to build their own local communities with help from PSF. And to promote diversity, which I can tell is an issue here, to have more and more people with different background with us.

To ask me anything hit me up on Twitter: @teners__, or email me: hi (at) teners (dot) me.

Lilly Ryan
=============

*New Board Member. (Nominated by Anna Ossowski)*

Anna: *I nominate Lilly Ryan for the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors. Lilly is a caring, engaged, and outspoken member of our community, who is passionate about diversity and inclusion. I admire her outstanding work for PyCon Australia and for the Australian Python community as a whole. I strongly believe that having Lilly on the board would be a great win for the Python Software Foundation.*

**Lilly about herself, her involvement, and goals**:

Background
--------------

I’ve contributed to the Python community in Australia and several other countries by publicly advocating for strong technical teamwork and software development security. I currently work as a penetration tester and will bring a strong voice for security and privacy to the Board, as well as representing the views of the information security community, who are also strong users of Python.

While currently Australian-based, I admire the international Python community for its welcoming nature, and have experienced the same culture in New Zealand, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the United States. This has encouraged me to contribute to sustaining this and spreading the community to new places.

I am Papers Chair for PyCon AU 2018 and have led a very hands-on effort to run an anonymous Call for Proposals, and to shape a process that will encourage first-time speakers, and speakers from underrepresented groups. As an experienced speaker, I also mentor people who would like to speak or write to develop their ideas and contribute more to the community.

I’m not shy to speak up about community issues and to advocate for greater diversity and inclusion, and as part of the Board I would like to do this with a particular focus on the Asia Pacific region.

Tania Sanchez
=============
*New board member*

Background
----------

I am Tania Sanchez (I also go around as Allard), and I am a Research Software Engineer (RSE)at the University of Leeds in the UK. I, like many other Python users, came for the approachability and versatility of the Python language but it is the community I fell in love with, although I have used Python far longer than I have been an active community member. 

My current role involves developing software for research purposes, which means I spend a lot of time around the PyData and the SciPy communities. Also, I am heavily focused on helping researchers to do more with their data and code while promoting open science and open research practices. This in many ways is parallel to the practices and values of the open source community, and I often find myself drawing inspiration from our great community.

As much of my current role revolves around culture change, I spend a significant part of my time also focusing on community and capacity building, mentoring, building bridges between existing communities and facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations. Examples of this are the creation of the Python Coding club in Sheffield as well as an online Python coding club for people with art, humanities and/or social sciences background. I am also a Mentor for the Mozilla open leaders programme which is a global open source mentorship program. Also, I have started mentorship programmes for URM (Underrepresented minorities) and first-time speakers for the various conferences in which I served as a committee member on top of regular mentoring to those new to open source.  Ah and last but not least, I will continue this with the newly founded PyLadies chapter for the NorthWest region of the UK.

I am also an active consumer, contributor, and maintainer of a number of open source projects. Making the jump from consumer to contributor and finally, maintainer wouldn’t have been possible without a number amazing supporters and mentors in our community. So I am aware I am lucky to have mentors and friends who patiently guide me when I am lost and dubious about how I can contribute to our ecosystem. So I think it is fair to say I owe the community a whole lot.

Finally, I am really passionate about Diversity and Inclusion and work with many organizations and projects to make the OSS and tech communities a welcoming, supportive and safe places for everyone,  in particular, those currently underrepresented and underserved groups. Some examples of this are my roles as Python lead instructor for CodeFirst: Girls and diversity chair for the RSE and Julia conferences as well as my ongoing participation in the Mozfest diversity taskforce, the Rforwards core team, and NUMFOCUS diversity and inclusion initiatives. Although the Python community is by far the friendliest community I belong to, I also believe there is much that we can learn from and contribute to other communities.

I am also a frequent speaker at local meetups, international conferences and one of the newest additions to the PSF bloggers team.  

I have said too much about myself, so you might want to know what I want to get done.

My objectives as a board member
-------------------------------

**Enhanced community mentorship**: I would like to strengthen the Python Core Mentorship initiative, mainly to better serve underrepresented groups as I want to see a greater diversity of contributors. I am particularly interested in establishing an open mentorship programme (e.g. developing hacks, manuals/resources, mentor-mentee matches). This will not only increase the diversity of the contributors but contribute to the sustainability of our community (mentoring individuals that would then become contributors and mentors) and the emergence of role models.

**Increase the visibility and transparency of the PSF**:  Highlighting and measuring the impact of the PSF initiatives on the community is crucial. We need to make sure the members of our community understand what the PSF does and how it does it. So I would like to raise awareness about the duties of the PSF among the wider community. This way we can better engage with the community and better understand their needs. At the same time, this will help PSF to maximize said impact and eventually set goals and action plans in conjunction with the grants workgroup to get more funding for additional initiatives (leading to more impact and the ability to apply for further funding...). 

**Attract funding**:  This goal is directly linked to the previous one, so I would like to help to define goals as to where the PSF will be going in the next few years and transform this into actionable tasks to improve the grant acquisition processes.

**Strengthening of the Spanish speaking community**: The Spanish speaking community is rapidly growing, a proof of this was the success of the PyCon Charlas session. However, language is still a barrier for some users since most of the resources for Python and global community events are in English and unfortunately, not all the Latin-American population speaks  English. I want to develop some Spanish learning resources and contribute towards the growth, sustainability, and progress of the Latin-American community. There have been sporadic talks about organizing a PyCon Latinamerica following the success from PyCon Colombia, but so far there are no concrete actions or plans to make this a reality. I would love to help towards the organization of a PyCon LatinAmerica and spread the Python community spirit.
