Marc-Andre Lemburg
==================

*2012 Board Member.*

I've been board member in the years 2002-2004 and then again since 2010.

PSF things I've been working on last year:

* the Python brochure project (see http://brochure.getpython.info/)

* the PSF conference kits to market the PSF at Python conferences (see e.g. https://twitter.com/reingart/status/270590720790904832)
 
* creating giveaway marketing material for use a Python conferences and user groups (flyers, stickers)
 
* promoting the PSF and the HAM membership at conferences in Europe (EuroPython, PyCon UK, PyCon DE, FOSDEM)

in addition to the usual PSF board work.

Things I'd like to initiate this year:

* create conference kits to promote Python for use at conferences that have a broarder scope such as OSCON and FOSDEM
 
* create more marketing material and setup a way for conferences and user groups to more easily request such material
 
* start work on creating a PSF network of national and regional Python associations to help market Python in more diverse ways

I'd like to continue with this work as director and look forward to another year serving on the board.
