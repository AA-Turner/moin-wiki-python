Marc-Andre Lemburg
==================

*2012 Board Member.*

I've been board member in the years 2002-2004 and then again since 2010.

PSF things I've been working on last year:

* the Python brochure project (see http://brochure.getpython.info/)

* the PSF conference kits to market the PSF at Python conferences (see e.g. https://twitter.com/reingart/status/270590720790904832)
 
* creating giveaway marketing material for use a Python conferences and user groups (flyers, stickers)
 
* promoting the PSF and the HAM membership at conferences in Europe (EuroPython, PyCon UK, PyCon DE, FOSDEM)

in addition to the usual PSF board work.

Things I'd like to initiate this year:

* create conference kits to promote Python for use at conferences that have a broarder scope such as OSCON and FOSDEM
 
* create more marketing material and setup a way for conferences and user groups to more easily request such material
 
* start work on creating a PSF network of national and regional Python associations to help market Python in more diverse ways

I'd like to continue with this work as director and look forward to another year serving on the board.

David Mertz
==================

*Current 2012/13 Board Member.*

I have served on the PSF board for four years, would like to continue to do so, and would be honored if the membership elects me again to do so.

* Beginning prior to membership on the board, and on a continuing basis, I serve on the PSF Trademarks Committee, currently as its Chair. We resolve legal matters in the committee, enter into relationships of fiscal sponsorship with relevant projects to further protect our IP, and generally improve the relationships with broader Python communities through friendly and productive conversations about trademark rights. 

  * Having a friendly demeanor and also a thorough concern with protection of PSF rights, when I send a "C&D" letter as TC chair, the reply I get is always "thank you."  

  * Of late, I assisted moderately with PSF Chair Van Lindberg's spearheading of an opposition to a conflicting trademark claim in the EU over a logo incorporating the "Python" word mark.

* I created the voting procedure used by the PSF for the prior couple years (and the small software tools needed to make it work), assisted the PSF Secretary in its operation, and administered the last election. In response to some requests by members, I worked wtih PSF member (and Web2Py lead) Massimo Di Pierro to get his E-vote software concept to provide all the same wonderful cryptographic and security guarantees as the prior email-based system (and some more).

* As a Director I have participated in supervising, and reaching some difficult staffing decisions.

* I am chair of the Outreach and Education Committee, which was formed in 2011. The committee has funded numerous outreach efforts to user groups and educational efforts, and will continue to fund more in the future; acting as Board liaison is useful.

* I was very pleased to serve as PSF/Board representative to give one of the two keynotes at PyCon-India in 2012.  As well as enjoying representing the PSF broadly, this tied in with the mission of the Outreach & Education to regionally/nationally diversify interest in and commitment to Python and to the PSF.

* By background, I am a recovering humanities academic, tempted away from post-structuralist political philosophy by the intrigue and wiles of algorithms and data structures (always best expressed in this language Guido gave us). 

* I am the author of Addison Wesley's *Text Processing in Python*, of the IBM developerWorks' column *Charming Python* (since 2001), and of various other articles advancing and explaining the use of Python and its tools and libraries. I have created some moderately well-used FOSS Python tools (most collected in Gnosis Utilities); these have been poorly maintained in recent years, I confess, but I am delighted that several large pieces have recently been adopted for maintenance by other FLOSS developers. 

* Often a speaker at PyCon and OSCON. I have been an advocate for use of Python by several public-interest software projects, including in the voting software developed by the Open Voting Consortium (I was CTO and board member of that organization). I also have been a consultant with a number of notable Python-using organizations, at the margins helping to expand that use.

* Helped/led http://rupy.eu RuPy, PyLadies @ http://djangocon.us DjangoCon US, and the https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/ DSF scholarship programs.
* Held workshops for PyLadies & PyLaddies to craft PyCon talk submissions, and practice PyCon conference talks
* Maintainer of http://www.pyladies.com PyLadies website, and led the site's redesign.

What I wish to continue:

* Diversity outreach with speaking, holding events, and starting conversations.
* Help future PyCons in North America with program selection, and any other capacity that I can.
* Spread the word & love for Python & open source by holding intro workshops, sprints for OSS projects, writing http://github.com/econchick/new-coder tutorials, etc.
* Continue creating comfortable environments for Pythonistas and budding new coders to learn, develop, hack, speak, etc.

Naomi Ceder
==============

*New Board Member.*

I've been using, promoting and teaching Python on various levels since 2000, as a
teacher, author, developer, manager, and organizer. 

In addition to being the author of The Quick Python Book, 2nd ed., which was Manning
Publications' number 2 selling book in 2012, and giving various Python talks
and tutorials, I currently am one of the organizers and main instructor of the Chicago Python
Workshops and am active in ChiPy's North branch. 

After creating the poster session at PyCon and coordinating it for 3
years, this year I proposed and am coordinating the first education
summit at PyCon, which will have about 90 attendees from all areas of
Python education.

As IT director of a company that runs on Python I'm very interested in
the long term health and growth of Python and the Python community,
and my personal circumstances have given me some very personal
experience with diversity and inclusion from several different, and even contradictory, perspectives.

Finally, perhaps the best qualification I can offer is that once
committed to something like this, I'm excruciatingly reliable - I
absolutely hate to miss meetings or deadlines, and I make sure tasks I'm assigned "just get done." 

My goal as a board member would be to do all that I can to help the
PSF achieve its mission in any way that I can. In particular, I'm interested in furthering the adoption of Python 3, in making sure that python.org has the resources it needs to serve the growing communitiy, in fostering the growth of that community through education and outreach, and in ensuring that the Python community is as inclusive and welcoming as possible.

Brett Cannon
==============

*New Board Member (sort of).*

I was previously a board member from 2006 - 2010 until I needed to leave the board to focus on my Ph.D. I have been a member of both the PSF and the Python development team since April 2003 (nearly a decade).

I have two reasons for running for the board:

1. To make sure that there is board representation of python-dev by an actively contributing core developer
2. To improve the level of discourse on psf-members

Point 1 is to simply make sure that the needs of the development team which maintain the programming language we have all rallied around are met.

Point 2 is in reaction to sometimes abhorrent exchanges that have occurred on psf-members over the past year. I want to see change there, so I am deciding to be *that* change by running for the board to be in a position to do what I can to make psf-members a pleasant place to discuss any relevant topic.

Tarek Ziadé
===========

*New Board Member*

I am a Python developer at Mozilla, I have created the French Python user Group (Afpy), write some books in French & english about Python and tried to help in the packaging issues.


I want to be a board member to do the following:

1. create a website like https://reps.mozilla.org/people for the Python community - a place that lists community members & their actions
2. help in the ongoing effort of have a network of local PSF representatives

----

Brian Curtin
============

*Current Board Member*

I was elected to the board in 2012, and was elected to the membership in 2011.

I've been involved with the following efforts around the Python community:

* Communications. I'm currently the PSF's Communications Officer, and I'm the lead and basically sole member of the Communications Committee. In this capacity, I've written many blog posts for the PSF blog, have done several email campaigns to get news out, and have kept our followers connected on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. I also maintain the PSF sections of the website.

* PyCon. I've been involved with PyCon since 2010 on the program committee, but my primary contribution has been communications related. For PyCon 2011 I ran a series of interviews to drum up publicity, and for PyCon 2012 and 2013 I was/am the formal Publicity Coordinator. In this capacity I have publicized just about every aspect of the conference through a heavy blogging and email campaign, along with extensive use of Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. I've also gained experience and several contacts in the tech news scene, whom I hope to leverage when it comes to some of the more publicly interesting PSF actions.

* Sprints. I've been involved with the Sprints Committee since its inception, and became the leader of the committee. I've done some outreach to get groups interested in doing sprints, and through my previously mentioned communications work, I keep my ear low to the ground and try to chime in when I see sprints being organized (via the 100+ user group mailing lists I follow). Although the committee is mostly on "cruise control" a great deal of the time, I do some writing and also handle reimbursements.

* New Website. I've been involved somewhat in the early portions of the redesign project for proposal reviewing, but I've been more involved post-selection. I'm currently working with the team on sample content as they design certain parts, and I'll be involved in generating copy for the final site.

* CPython. This has become a smaller part of my time than I'd like, but I'm still close with the core team and contribute in bursts every few months. I tend to look after the Windows side of things - the installer, winreg, os module, etc.

As for my 2013 plans:

* Increase visibility both at the board level and the greater PSF level. The occasional news we put out is fine and well and it gets good uptake, but I'd like to turn it up. When it comes to public news generated by the PSF, I'd like to consider using formal press releases like we do for PyCon and leverage the press relationships I've started to build from that. When it comes to the board, I'd like to help keep the membership closer in tune to what's going on. When it comes to the committees, I'd like to make sure everyone knows who they are, what they're doing, and why they're doing it. Some of this work is website work, and some of it is just more frequent and detailed email reporting. The community and membership want and deserve more information.

* Extend our hands to the global community. The 2012 board had tossed around some ideas and I think it's time to get something going. I'd like to see us identify leaders in local communities around the globe and give them a direct pipeline into the PSF (via a committee of members, and at least one board member), perhaps calling them representatives (regional, country, etc). I want to make sure user groups are informed and connected to the PSF's news, funds, resources, and network so that not only we can help them, but they can help us.

* Get more people involved. This ties in with the visibility issue, but we have a lot of things that are ripe for contribution, and a lot of people not sure what they can do around here. We have a number of committees currently in operation, and we probably have more ideas than we know what to do with. I would like to present more information about what we have and try to spark some new committees so that there's more of a sense of accomplishment than the PSF being "just a mailing list". I've felt that way and a lot of people have - let's do something about it.

I was honored to have been elected in 2012, and would be honored to serve again in 2013.
