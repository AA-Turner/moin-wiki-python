== 2023 Q2 Nominations ==

=== Yifei Wang ===

My name is Le Zheng. I have a PhD in electrical engineering and I am currently a principal electrical engineer at a biotechnology startup Detect Inc. It’s my pleasure to nominate Yifei Wang as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I have known her for over 2 years through a local Python community. During this time, I have witnessed her exceptional leadership in her efforts to promote Python programming and has made significant contributions to the Python community as a devoted educator, particularly in helping minority groups.


Yifei's dedication to teaching Python has resulted in long-lasting and substantial gains in the number and quality of Python users. She has given multiple talks at local conferences and career sessions about the importance of Python, and has dedicated a significant amount of time teaching Python to homeless children at Children Welfare Home in Nepal - a least developed country. Under her guidance, the group of orphans quickly transformed from having no experience with programming to being able to write simple programs, solve problems, automate tasks, and build amazing things. Yifei's efforts have had a lasting impact on these children, who are no longer just trying to survive day-to-day, but now have a sense of purpose and a new set of skills to help them succeed in life. They even started teaching other children in the shelter how to code, a testament to the effectiveness of Yifei's leadership.


Furthermore, Yifei has been a highly sought-after Python teacher at the local community, SavvyUni, since 2017. Over the years, thousands of students have benefited from her classes and become excellent Python programmers from having zero knowledge on the field. She has also started the Women Initiative two years ago, a community aimed at helping women learn Python programming, demonstrating her commitment to diversity and inclusivity in the Python community.


Yifei's contributions to the Python community have been widely recognized as being above and beyond normal volunteering. Her efforts serve as a shining example of the power of programming to transform lives and make a positive impact on the world. For the orphans, local communities, and female communities, Yifei's teachings have opened up a whole new world of possibilities and opportunities that they never thought possible. As such, Yifei Wang is highly deserving of the recognition as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

== 2023 Q1 Nominations ==

=== Aseda Addai-Deseh ===
I, Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe, propose that Aseda Addai-Deseh be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, for her significant contributions to the PyLadies Ghana Community as a Team player and the Lead for the community's Data Science Initiative.

Aseda has been at the forefront of Leading the Data Science Initiative since 2019 which has helped increase our membership. She has helped organize boot camps and meetups that have provided training materials and tutorials to about 60 women from Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, etc. During these sessions, she coordinated all volunteering efforts from other members and mentors. This effort has led to some members gaining full-time Data Science roles and others finding a career path using Python for Data Science. Her vision for the community is to help more women land these roles.

In 2019, Aseda gave a talk on "A reintroduction to Data Science" at the first-ever PyCon Africa, hosted in Ghana. Her session was published here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyMhOsTJLQk). Like other members of the community, I have benefitted from Aseda's willingness to collaborate and achieve the goals of the community.

=== Barney Gale ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, David Lord (PSF Fellow 2020), propose that Barney Gale be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to improving Python's built-in pathlib library. Begining in February 2020, they have worked to gain support with core devs, created 70 PRs so far, and provided ongoing, detailed updates in the forum.

Here's an example of a post they make to keep the community updated on their work: https://discuss.python.org/t/make-pathlib-extensible/3428/77

Here's a list of pull requests they've been working on in the cpython repository: https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abarneygale+

=== Eric Traut ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Eric Traut be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to Python with PyRight, the open source static analysis tool that powers VS Code's Python capabilities, and his contributions to improving how advanced libraries define data types with the new standard dataclass-transform.

PyRight is the tool that powers the Pylance extension, the official extension for VS Code to handle Python. It performs all the static analysis, which results in autocompletion and inline errors in the editor. It also has additional features.

He also contributed PEP 681 – Data Class Transforms, originally as a draft in the PyRight repo. This enabled tools like Pydantic, Attrs, SQLModel, and others to declare that they exposed behaviors equivalent to dataclasses, and this way, allowed to get better support while working with these tools, including autocompletion and inline errors.

When he created the first draft of dataclass-transform, he added support for it in PyRight, which enabled tools to take advantage of what was the new (future) standard even before it was official. This was adopted by Pydantic, Attrs, SQLModel, and others. And that way, the developer experience improved in VS Code (as it used PyRight) for those libraries. But all this work was done in a way that could be open and a standard (which it finally became), instead of as a closed extension tied exclusively to one vendor. I consider this work, the early adopters' implementation, plus immediate adoption once it became a standard, and the effort to make all that work open and in a standard/official way highly commendable.

=== Gina Häußge ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, Miroslav Šedivý, a PSF Fellow, propose that Gina Häußge be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to her significant contributions to the Python community. In 2012, Gina [1] created a Python-driven software project OctoPrint [2], that became the standard in the open-source 3D printing community. Not only does she drive the development of this vibrant project, but she is also very actively participating in sprints and conferences and providing mentorship to other developers, both in person and as a frequent guest on various podcasts, sharing her knowledge and experiences with others and inspiring other developers to get involved in the open-source community.

=== Grishma Jena ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, Upkar Lidder, propose that Grishma Jena be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to her significant contributions to the Python community. In 2016, Grishma taught Python to students from middle and high school as part of Program Your Future at UC Berkeley. She regularly taught Python and gave talks on Data Science at the San Francisco Public Library from 2017-18. She was also a mentor to high-school students as part of the non-profit AI4ALL’s program and guided them in using Python to create an app that helps triage 911 calls.

From 2018, Grishma has delivered talks and workshops teaching Python, along with its applications for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. These have been for people across the globe including at PyCon US, PyLadies (global), PyConf Hyderabad, PyTennessee, PyCaribbean, Mini PyCon (San Francisco), IBM (internal), IBM Developer and IBM Call for Code (global), KeepCoding (Madrid), and multiple other conferences across USA, Canada, India, and virtually. She frequently holds Python workshops for high school and university students. Grishma also helped create 2 external IBM professional certification exams (Data Science Professional and Certified Data Scientist - Watson Specialist) that help people prove their knowledge of Python and Python’s Data Science tools and packages. Through her efforts, she has encouraged more than 1600 people to discover the magic of Python and to continue exploring it.

=== Martijn Pieters ===
I, Andrey Semakin, propose that Martijn Pieters be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contribution to the Python StackOverflow forum.
 
As a result of Martijn's contributions to the community, I believe that he has undoubtedly helped countless newcomers to learn the language. His dedication to the community is remarkable, and his work has been instrumental in fostering a supportive and vibrant community of Python developers.

Martijn's homepage: https://www.zopatista.com/ (all other contacts like Twitter can be found here).
Just take a look at his SO page: https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters (over 1 million points of reputation!)

=== Samuel Colvin ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Samuel Colvin be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to Python with Pydantic.

Pydantic is an open source tool to perform data validation, serialization, parsing, and documentation. It powers FastAPI and many other libraries. It uses standard type annotations with standard types, which has also helped increase the adoption of type annotations in Python codebases, improving their type safety.

Recently he's been rewriting the internals of Pydantic in Rust, to improve its performance and add several features, while reducing the environmental cost of those thousands of codebases that use it.

=== Soon Seng Goh ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2023''

I, Soong Chee Gi, propose that Mr Soon Seng Goh be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Mr Goh is a retired software developer who is passionate about imparting his knowledge to youths and adults. Driven by the observation of the shortage and lack of maker and tinkering coding education in mainstream schools (the percentage of K-12 students who reads a structured course of study in computer science and programming is typically about or less than 5%, or non-existent in most schools in Singapore) and the general population, he reached out to Singapore's National Library Board (NLB) to initiate an outreach program in NLB's MakeIt makerspace facilities to the public library users. The program is a free five-week [introductory Python programming with Raspberry Pi course](https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/communities/join/digital-communities), with ad-hoc sessions held afterwards, targeting children as young as 9 years old and retirees as senior as 70+ aged, conducted weekly in English at MakeIT @ Tampines Regional Library. With the assistance of 3 regular volunteers, and sometimes her daughter supporting some sessions, he has successfully conducted 7 runs of the program to date (as at Feb 2023) since Sep 2021. He also adapted the course to a group of high school teachers to share how physical computing activities can be infused into their school enrichment programs, so that beginning programming learners can be meaningfully engaged with authentic tasks integrating both hardware and software.

Besides initiating the Pi with Python introductory course, Mr Goh also started a [Pi Makers Club](https://github.com/ssgoh/The-Pi-Club) with NLB that meets on the first Sunday of each month in 2022, where members undertake more advanced projects using the Raspberry Pi. Starting 2023 the club has been exploring using the Raspberry Pi Pico, a microcontroller that runs MicroPython. He continuously seeks to not only initiate programs that welcome newcomers, but also thinks about longer term developmental plans to retain and sustain members' interest.

All programme information and learning resources are [shared with the community and open sourced](https://github.com/ssgoh).

Mr Goh has also shared about his motivation and experience at [PyCon SG 2019 education summit](https://pycon.sg/edu-summit) (lightning talk: Making Python our Digital Mother Tongue) and [PyCon SG 2022 education summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkvsHHpfFIc&t=9508s) (talk: Pi and Python). His engagement talks have further inspired other educators to initiate similar ventures with the community libraries near their schools.

As a community which values diversity and inclusivity, the Python ecosystem is enriched with selfless contributors like Mr Goh who continues to care about and proactively reaches out to the more vulnerable segments of the society, even in his golden years.

I thus propose that Mr Soon Seng Goh be recognized as a PSF Fellow as he is deservingly a role model in his generation and beyond to inspire and encourage more Pythonistas from underrepresented groups, especially seniors who can still continue to lead purposeful lives by rediscovering the joy of learning and digital making with Python programming, an increasingly important core digital literacy life skill in today's technology permeated world, so that they are still meaningfully connected to society.

== 2022 Q4 Nominations ==

=== Danny Adair ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

We write to you as past & present committee members of the New Zealand Python User Group - Ben Bradshaw (new Vice President), Tom Clark (President 2018-2022; sitting committee member), Carlos Cordero (Treasurer since 2018), and myself (exiting Vice President, newly retired).

We would like to jointly nominate Danny Adair to be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Danny founded the NZPUG (https://python.nz/) in 2009, and sat as President until stepping down to Committee member in 2018; his unbroken tenure continues still, as he was re-elected by our membership this week during our AGM. He was also the guiding force that led NZPUG to become a Registered Charity in early 2016 - not an easy feat in the face of Charities legislation.

During his time as founder and President, Danny has also been organiser for a number of our annual Kiwi PyCon conferences in the Far North, Auckland, and Wellington - and has been Sponsorship Coordinator for all 11 Kiwi PyCon's held during the existence of NZPUG. During all this, Danny has been the organiser of the monthly Wellington NZPUG meetups for many years, and provides ongoing support for our five meetup groups across the country.

Danny himself has been a steadfast promoter of Python in New Zealand for decades now, and his name is deeply connected with an unswerving commitment to community - and unity - in our shared appreciation of Python. It is difficult to think of any other person who has single-handedly had such a strong and enduring influence on the Python community within New Zealand. NZPUG - quite literally - would not exist without him.

We passionately advocate for his formal recognition as a Fellow of the PSF.

=== Yung-Yu Chen ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, Iqbal Abdullah, a PSF Fellow, would like to nominate Yung-Yu Chen (or widely known as YYC) as a PSF Fellow to acknowledge his efforts in building a base for the Python community in Taiwan and the East Asian region.

YYC started the first PyCon TW in 2012 (https://tw.pycon.org/2022/en-us/about/history) as the first chair and continued to lead the organizing team up until PyCon APAC 2015.

YYC now doesn't participate actively in the organizing of conferences and community events, but this is where his leadership and his contribution to our community shines: His vision has enabled the PyCon TW community to have a strong succession plan. PyCon TW continues to show robustness in promoting Python within its community, and even when other communities were unable to stand up to organize a regional conference for 2022, PyCon TW took up the task with their batch of young leaders. As Naomi Ceder put it: "There is no leadership when you don't have a succession plan" (or something to that effect).
 
YYC continues to participate in regional discussions and is active in recruiting young people from his community to get involved in other regional conferences to increase partnership within the region. In his professional life, he is also active in promoting diversity (i.e gender diversity by encouraging and training young female engineers to
speak at conferences and opportunities to gain skills). He is still actively contributing his time, experience and knowledge giving ideas and helping improve partnerships between the different communities in East/South East Asia.

I have also personally realized how easy it is for us to miss this type of community work: We tend to focus on the right here and right now, but we tend to miss the ones that only show their results 5 or 10 years down the line. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge my compatriot YYC with this nomination.

=== Soong Chee Gi ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Soong Chee Gi be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Soong Chee's contribution to the Python community in APAC generally and to the youths of Singapore cannot be understated and should be recognized.

Soong Chee's have been teaching Python for high school children in Singapore and have taken initiatives to bring them to PyCons within this region, exposing them to the larger community, while giving them opportunities to give talks on their own experiences using and developing with Python.

He also organizes Education Summit alongside PyCons to initiate dialogue, increase awareness of the importance of programming within the syllabus and also as a support group for educators in the field within this region.

Soong Chee might not be as prolific as other members and organizers of our community, due to his humble personality and so it is more important that we highlight the work that people like him have done. Soong Chee is not only a mere organizer: In all my years working with the community in this region, he is perhaps the only organizer working to create a better future for the community and the language: By working directly with our future, the school children.

We need to recognize more selfless individuals like Soong Chee within the APAC region, who needs to be shown as role-models to further motivate our communities within this region

=== Josef Heinen ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, Reimar Bauer, propose that Josef Heinen be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to his significant contributions to the Python community as maintainer and lead developer of the GR framework for cross-platform visualization applications. The framework can be used as a backend for Matplotlib and can significantly improve the performance of existing Matplotlib or PyPlot applications. Unlike Matplotlib, GR can also be used in traditional (C, C++) and other REPL languages (Julia, Ruby) with various toolkits (e.g. Qt) or in web-based applications.
Josef Heinen spoke on the EuroPython, SciPy, PyConUS, PyConDE conference series.

I, Georg Brandl, support the nomination.

=== Dr. Philip Jones ===
I, Yeray Díaz, would like to propose that Dr. Philip Jones be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Dr. Jones https://pgjones.dev/ is the author of the Quart web framework https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/, a fully async port of the extremely popular Flask web framework and author of many plugins for Quart, such as Quart-Auth https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-auth/index.html and Quart-Schema https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart-schema/index.html. He is also the author of Hypercorn https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/, a highly performant ASGI web server. He recently joined the prominent Pallets https://github.com/orgs/pallets/people development group and has been collaborating on maintaining several of their project, including Flask, Jinja, and Werkzeug. He's also a member of the python-hyper https://github.com/python-hyper group where he maintains sans-io libraries such as h2 https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2 and wsproto https://github.com/python-hyper/wsproto.

I believe his body of work and commitment to the language and Open Source are more than enough to warrant him this recognition.

=== Hugo van Kemenade ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, Mariatta Wijaya, propose that Hugo van Kemenade be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community.

Hugo is a maintainer of the pillow library (https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow). He has been actively contributing to CPython in various areas: code, documentation, infrastructure, and tooling. Hugo has been an active member of the Python Triage team since January 2022. At the time of writing this, Hugo is being considered for Python core devs privileges.


== 2022 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Iqbal Abdullah ===
''Selected in Q3 of 2022''

I, Kwon-Han Bae, propose that Iqbal Abdullah be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I met him at PyCon APAC 2013 (https://apac-2013.pycon.jp/). At that time, PyCon APAC was just 3 countries ( SG, JP, TW ). With the support of people including Iqbal, I started PyCon KR 2014 the next year.

Since then, Iqbal has attended PyCon KR multiple times even though most of presence was made in Korean, which he doesn't understand. He gave some talks in English and supported PyCon KR to hold PyCon APAC 2016. 

=== Kwon-Han Bae ===
''Selected in Q3 of 2022''

I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Kwon-Han Bae be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Kwon-Han's contribution to the Python community in APAC generally and South Korea specifically cannot be understated and should be recognized. He was one of the founding members of PyCon KR, starting it from humble beginnings in 2014 and now hosts over 1800 Pythonistas yearly in the biggest conference venue in South Korea.

Kwon-Han was also a leading figure galvanizing support and volunteers to take part and host PyCon APAC 2016 together with South Korea's East Asian neighbours Taiwan and Japan.

Currently, he does not actively participate in organizing the community as before. He has done a wonderful job of passing on the responsibilities to the next generation of organizers, which I believe is a key reason for the success of the Python community in South Korea. He now plays an important leading role in managing and getting the various communities in East and South East Asia to work together and maintain good relationships to further the values and promote Python through PyCons within the region, which goes far beyond "just organizing events".

We need to recognize more selfless individuals like Kwon-Han within the APAC region, who needs to be shown as role models to further motivate our communities within this region.

=== Sayan Chowdhury ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, Kushal Das, propose that Sayan Chowdhury be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Sayan Chowdhury works as a Linux OS Engineer at Microsoft.

=== Nicolas Laurance ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2022''

I, David Gibbons, propose that Nicolas Laurance be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community in Ireland. Nicolas has been involved for over seven years with organising events in Ireland. In particular, as chairperson for the last four and half years of Python Ireland. He has been a driving force in creating new collaborations with other local organizations (tech and others), and setting up regular, interesting events for the large Python community in Ireland. As a committee member of Python Ireland myself, I know he has shown very good leadership with planning and hosting our monthly meetups, which has been particularly challenging given the remote setup over the last two years. He has also delivered some very interesting Python talks himself over the last number of years.

=== Denny Perez ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2022''

I, Cristián Maureira-Fredes, would like to nominate Denny Perez to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to her significant contributions to the Python community, particularly for all her work empowering the Spanish speaking community in many countries.

Denny has been in touch with different groups and activities around Python and Open Source since 2019. She created a group called “Chicas en Programación Mtl” with a few Latin women in Montreal, where she organized many events in person, and helped as a mentor while teaching Python from scratch. When the pandemic worsened, the group was a bit stalled, but she started to look for other initiatives where she could help, joining as a coordinator in the Python en Español Discord Server [1] which is a community that aims to gather all the Spanish speaking Python community.

She has been volunteering in many Python conferences in any area that needed help, just to name a few:

  * PyCon US 2018 and 2019 (PyLadies Stand and PyLadies Auction)
  * PyCon Latam 2019 (Being a Host and the Volunteering Team Coordinator [2])
  * PyCon Canada 2019 (Registration/Swags)
  * Python Brasil 2021 (Host and session Runner)
  * PyCon US 2021 (Chat room moderator PyCharlas)
  * PyCascades 2022 (Chat room Moderator)

Denny has also participated in many meetups events as a speaker, like: Python Panamá, Python Nicaragua, Python Dominicana, and Python Bolivia, and also in conferences like PyCon Brasil 2021.

At the moment, besides her participation in the Python en Español Discord server, she is a co-organizer of PyCon Latam (since 2020) [2], she is a co-organizer of the Python Chile community [3] (where she helped to have the first PyCon Chile in 2021), she is also a co-organizer and co-founder of the first Chilean PyLadies chapter, PyLadies Santiago (2021) [4], and this year she is the co-chair of the PyCon Charlas Track at PyConUS 2022.

=== Paul McGuire ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2022''

I, Steve Holden (former chairman of the PSF and a director for 8 years), hereby propose that Paul McGuire be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation due to his significant contributions as creator and long-term maintainer of the popular open source pyparsing package. I have personally observed his support of the Python community both in that work (where he has built and supported an extremely competent team to support the project) and in the StackOverflow Python chat room where he is a long-time active participant.  His Stackoverflow page at https://stackoverflow.com/users/165216/paulmcg, with its typically modest description, gives more background to support this nomination. As a result of his acknowledged expertise, Paul was invited to join the authors of the 4th edition Python in a Nutshell, which will be a better book for his participation due to his all-round Python knowledge in depth.

=== Priyanshu Agarwal ===
I, Priyanshu Agarwal, propose myself to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to my significant contributions to the Python community.

I am an active contributor to various open source projects. I have made significant code contributions, along with extensive tests and documentation coverage, to the python package PyBaMM. It houses state-of-the-art automatic differentiation and numerical solvers that solve physics-based electrochemical DAE models. As part of my Google Summer of Code, I adapted PyBaMM’s expression trees to render mathematical equations in latex using SymPy. I have taken full ownership of the project by not just working on the requirements that were laid out originally but also contributing my own ideas. Recently, I took the initiative to automate PyBaMM’s release workflow on PyPI and am now the maintainer of this repository on conda-forge. I am also trying to build a community and attract additional contributors to the project by delivering a talk at the Faraday Institute, UK, and hosting AMA sessions. In addition, I recently signed on as a contributor to liionpack, a PyBaMM offshoot project, to kickstart its development. I am also a part of various communities like Google Developer Group Pune and PythonPune. I strongly believe in Python and hope to become a Python Software Foundation fellow member.

[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8v2XaI9AsI&list=PLA9uqQmuXqOArixbAYPE0ILJ9uBqZDWbC

When working in academia, Sarah contributed to Python projects like InstrumentKit that were critical in enabling reproducible research via instrument automation. She helped not only her lab, but many others all over the world migrate away from closed source and expensive commercial tools to Python and Jupyter notebook based workflows by giving workshops, talks and writing documentation. 

She is currently an active developer on Mitiq [5], a Python compiler for error mitigation of quantum programs. This is a keystone tool that enables folks to use current and near-term quantum devices by reducing the errors in the results. This project has integrations with almost every major quantum computing provider and simulator and has been cited in several recent research papers. She helps run the weekly community calls for Mitiq, and helps troubleshoot and answer community questions on the project’s Discord.

[5]: https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

She also works with many Python maintainers on open source projects to help them develop best practices for their projects as well as hosts/produces interviews [6] on Twitch with maintainers on Python open source projects which helps feature and promote their projects as well as find great contributors. Whenever a new project is started, she always is ready to help get codes of conduct setup, as well as other tools and processes to help keep our spaces safe and welcoming to all.

[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxyqJDC4SUo&list=PL-VMs2BCTI_nnSQmBaccJ1CdQfw5cpHSp

Python is critical to the success of quantum computing, from the research happening in the labs, to connecting with the broader community of users of the technology. Now, almost every major quantum project is written in, or interoperates with Python. Sarah’s contributions have been critical in enabling the people, projects and communities that will continue to realize the potential of building quantum technology with Python.

=== John Hawley, Matthew Lagoe, James Lopeman ===
''John Hawley and James Lopeman selected in Q1 of 2022''

=== Seth Michael Larson ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2022''

I, Quentin Pradet, propose that Seth Michael Larson be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community.

Seth is the lead maintainer of urllib3, one of the most downloaded packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI). He fostered the urllib3 community throughout the years by welcoming both first-time contributors and new maintainers. He also maintains 50+ packages on PyPI and contributes to various packages that are critical to the Python ecosystem (requests, idna, distro, python-hyper).

He focuses on open-source sustainability in Python (through platforms like Tidelift, OpenCollective and GitCoin). Under his leadership, urllib3 opened up its finances on Open Collective [0] and received more than $8k, which are used to work towards urllib3 v2.0. He's also active on Twitter [1], sharing his Python expertise with the community.

=== Ana Dulce ===
''Selected in Q4 of 2021''

I, Marco Rougeth, propose that Ana Dulce be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Ana Dulce has been doing great work in the brazilian Python community for quite some time. More recently, she took the lead when nobody else wanted and organized Python Brasil conference in 2020 (first time online edition). She was also a key member of the organization team in the 2019 and 2021 editions of the conference.

Ana has been around since PyLadies Brasil was created in 2014 and she also has been an active member of the Sao Carlos' PyLadies branch. Over the years, she organized several meetups and study groups, taught programming to young girls from elementary and hight schools, gave talks and tutorials, helped with social media. The list goes on and on.

She likes to says that she prefers the "background" type of work in the community, mostly likely why she hasn't been recognized as a PSF Fellow yet.


=== Aidis Stukas ===
I, Harald Armin Massa, propose that Aidis Stukas be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I nominate him because of his significant contributions to the Python community. Aidis has been serving as the chair of PyCon Lithuania (PyCon LT) since 2017. While serving as chair of PyCon LT, he grew the conference from ~80 participants to ~330 participants, from a single day event into a 2 day event in 2019, with 10+ foreign speakers, 4 tracks, a Django girls session. Even more significant, he travelled to EuroPython (with the help of a PSF grant) to connect with international Pythonistas, to recruit them to come to Lithuania and speak at PyCon LT. In my eyes, crossing the boarder and connecting one national Python community with the global Python world is a very important step. Beyond chairing the event, he also developed and engaged a team of Pythonistas to run the conference, motivated Mantas Zimnickas, Jurgis Pralgauskis, Laurynas Speičys, Inga Pliavgo, Dainora Bucyte and some others to work on the conference. In addition to PyCon LT, Aidis organizes mutliple Python Meetups in Lithuania: KaunasPy (www.meetup.com/KaunasPy/). PyData Kaunas (www.meetup.com/PyData-Kaunas/)  

Also nominated by Mike Müller

=== Arnaud Legout ===
I, Jean-Frédéric Gerbeau, propose that Arnaud Legout and Thierry Parmentelat be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as co-authors of the most popular MOOC on Python in the French speaking countries. This MOOC, first created in 2014, and largely updated with the latest Python progress, reached 110,000 students in 101 countries. It is the official resource for all French high schools and undergrad professors to learn Python. Therefore, this MOOC has structured the learning Python in France. The nominees have also made a significant contribution to the use of the Python notebook in educational resources by using it since 2014 in the first edition of their MOOC Python.

=== Thierry Parmentelat ===

=== Thomas Caswell ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2022''

I, Madicken Munk, would like to nominate Thomas Caswell to be recognized as a fellow of the python software foundation. Thomas Caswell is the current project lead  of Matplotlib, the most widely used plotting package in the scientific Python community and I can't recommend him enough for this honor. Tom is a thoughtful leader that thinks about the software he maintains and how it fits into the broader scientific Python ecosystem, and is an active participant and organizer of scientific Python events. 

Tom is a strong leader guiding matplotlib into the future. He seeks out independent funding to ensure stability in matplotlib's development and maintenance, and is broadly welcoming and encouraging to all contributors to the project and to people joining the scientific Python community. Under Tom's leadership, a number of people have dedicated funding to develop and work on matplotlib, and matplotlib's community has grown as a result. Because matplotlib serves as a backend for many other scientific Python visualization packages like my own, their stability and maintenance benefits the development communities of many other packages. 

For the past several years Tom has co-organized the tools plenary at SciPy, which involves reaching out to various maintainers of projects in the scientific python ecosystem. Tom is thoughtful about how these packages are chosen, and tries to balance well-known core projects with newer projects that need an introduction to the community. At SciPy, Tom sought out other visualization package leaders to come up with standards for interoperability between visualization packages, making working in the ecosystem easier for users. Tom is always present during the sprints after SciPy concludes, and takes time to mentor potential contributors to matplotlib. Tom also was one of the individuals who spearheaded the effort for NEP 29, which set standards for when various Python versions would be supported and dropped in scientific python packages. This was a huge benefit to package maintainers like myself, and has been widely adopted by many core packages. 

=== Reshama Shaikh ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2022''

I (Gael Varoquaux) would like to nominate Reshama Shaikh as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I am interacting with Reshama via scikit-learn. In addition to her technical contributions, she does an amazing work on community and communication, organizing sprints, animating our social medias, and overall helping shaping the community by suggesting good people. She is hard at work on diversity and inclusion, with manners and messages so gentle that they make everybody happy. She has an incredibly good spirit and is really committed to building a better Python ecosystem. I know that she is active on other projects beyond scikit-learn.

=== Matteo Benci ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2022''

I, Patrick Arminio, nominate Matteo Benci. He's currently the treasurer of Python Italia, which is
already a very important role, but in addition to that he's helping a lot with the organization
of PyCon Italy and all the other events we try to do (PyFest, Django Girls and so). He's probably the most active member in our community and I think his involvement should be rewarded 😊 I don't think we'd be able to do all the amazing things we do without him. He was interviewed recently about his community involvement, unfortunately the interview is only in italian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnFMaxZgsI

== 2021 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Anthony Sottile ===
''Selected in Q3 of 2021''

I, Jürgen Gmach, propose that Anthony Sottile be recognized as a
Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages:
- pytest
- flake8
- tox
- pre-commit
- all-repos
- pyupgrade
and many more.

He also maintains the deadsnake-ppa, which enables all Ubuntu users to
install Python versions via a package manager which are not included
by Ubuntu by default.

He shares his knowledge via YouTube, via Twitch streams and also
online at his discourse board.

He also fixes critical bugs in cpython or never hesitates to help
other open source maintainers with extremely difficult problems.

The Python world would be very different without him.

=== Bernát Gábor ===
''Selected in Q3 of 2021''

I, Jürgen Gmach, propose that Bernát Gábor be recognized as a Fellow
of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages:
- tox
- virtualenv
- build
- pipx
and many more.

He shares his knowledge on various discord channels.

One thing I admire most - he tries to empower new contributors, by
supporting them to create Pull Requests, but also he tries to get new
contributors into becoming future maintainers, and he spends a
significant time preparing them for future tasks.

The Python world would be very different without him.

== 2021 Q2 Nominations ==

=== João Bueno ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2021''

I, Bruno Rocha, propose that João Bueno (a.k.a JS) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python and open-source software community.

He is one of the most active users of stack overflow answering all kinds of Python related questions both in English and Portuguese, the total number of answers he has selected there is awesome, too many newcomers and experienced developers have been helped by him.

He is one of the founding members of Python Brasil Association and Conference, co-founder of a hacker space and an excellent teacher and speaker on meetups and conferences.

JS is one of the smartest developers I know and he was a great source of inspiration when I started my career as a Python developer many years ago.

And most importantly, he is one of the core developers of GIMP (our lovely Linux Imaging Editing software)

=== Jakub Baláš ===
''Selected in Q2 of 2021''

I, Tomas Pytel, propose that Jakub Baláš be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a co-organiser of the monthly python meetups called "Brněnské Pyvo" in Czech Republic. Also, he is always helpful when I talk with him about Slovak Meetups - Bratislava Python Meetup, where I am a co-organizer.

Jakub is also a regular speaker at PyConSK where I think he is a big popularizer of python in the space industry, and his talks have always filled the biggest halls of PyConSK. As much as possible during the conference, he actively communicated with the participants and IMHO it was really visible that he is fully dedicated to Python. I think he, as a PyConSK speaker, back then helped us in organizing PyConSK, so he was actively searching/looking for us speakers in Britain when he worked there. This helped us, for example, to get one or two more good speakers. Really, as I've seen it later when meetups are dying for lack of interest, Jakub is really trying to make the Czech community around python really live and be really active, and I think he's doing very well.

=== Sony Valdez ===
I, Sony Valdez, propose myself to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I have made significant contributions to the Python community as a co-founder of Python.PH in 2013, served as president from 2013 to 2016, currently serve as Board of Trustee in said organization as Director of Community Relations, chairman for PyCon Philippines 2014 and 2015, help organized PyCon Philippines from 2016 to 2019, pioneered teaching Python in education at our country back in 2011, and a long time contributor to the local Python community in the Philippines.

=== Mikhail Kashkin ===
My name is Mikhail Kashkin and I want to nominate myself as PSF Fellow Member.
This is my story:
In 2000, I've started to work on my first paid office job. And my first project was on Perl. After year of development I found that I barely understand my own code and when I need to fix something I tend to rewrite code from scratch instead of changing it. Because Perl syntax was just unreadable. So, I decided to look into other programming languages and found Python — clean and beautiful language. That becomes my love and main language for the next 20 years. 
When I started to learn python it was hard to find documentation in Russian language, my mother tongue. Lack of documentation and knowledge led me to mail lists. I started to teach myself Python by asking help from the community and feel that I need to pay back. That is how I become active community member and soon promoter of the Python. In few years I become the first member of the Plone Foundation from ex-USSR countries. My company Key Solutions was listed as solution provider and python developers company on many sites (it that times it was popular). Also, my employer and colleague Andrey Orlov was paid maintainer for Python builds in AltLinux distribution (http://sisyphus.ru/ru/srpm/Branch3/rpm-build-python/changelog). And author of the Python Policy for that distribution. 
I created the site Plone.org.ru to unite people who are interested in Plone, Zope and Python. Later I passed maintenance of the site to the community, but you can see that most news posts are from me here https://plone.org.ru/newsitems/. My username on this site is `xen`. I've coordinated translation to Russian of Plone book (https://plone.org.ru/books/pb/ru/) and made proofreading and formatting of the content contributed by other people. BTW, I'm not sure about rights to this book. We didn't sell it, so I hope it doesn't violate somebody's rights.
During Key Solution times I've created more than 100 sites using Python. Include some big names: Association CRM of Russia and CIS, Russia Sport Channel, and biggest real estate agency MIEL.ru. As active open source contributor I won award Open Source Contributor 3rd place by opennet.ru site http://www.opennet.ru/konkurs/result-1.shtml (in Russian).
From 2008 year I moved to Ukraine and become one of co-organizer of the PyCon Ukraine conference as keynote speaker. Solo I organized events in Dnipro, Lviv, Odessa, Kharkhiv. But not only in Ukraine. During my business or holiday travels I've become speaker in Thailand, Armenia, Russia. Some videos from events are available on my Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0xkFZv2Df0&list=PLyUvGavKi98XnK4xwtsmwrtYdYoUnnxQk. 
Two years ago (in 2018) I decided to start consulting and education projects. Soon one of my clients becomes Yandex and I created big part of Backend Developer course  https://praktikum.yandex.ru/backend-developer/. In the first month after started courses team shared numbers I can't say exactly how many people become students and numbers was impressive. More important that I saw students code. It was very good. I'm proud to be process that give these people the chance to become Python developers.

Now I run my own python education course on https://Pylot.me and education platform https://Okumy.com.

To sum things up:
- I have always worked closely with the community
- As speaker participated in more than 100 events in last 20 years
- Helped hundreds of people to start using Python
- Worked with the biggest IT companies as python expert. Including: Google, Yandex, Mamba, etc 
- A lot of people associate my name to Python
- Helped to translate or wrote a lot of articles about Python or how to become Python developer
- Contributed to Plone (was Foundation Member), Zope, and other projects
- Run python teams and promoted Python as basic technology in many startups I had envolved

== 2021 Q1 Nominations ==

=== Joseph Banks, Leon Sandøy, and Sebastiaan Zeeff ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2021''

The Python Discord staff proposes that Joseph Banks, Leon Sandøy, and Sebastiaan Zeeff be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the owners of Python Discord.

Python Discord is a community for Python learning and discussion that has been active since 2017, and in that time they have worked diligently to foster a culture of warmth and inclusivity for all individuals regardless of their background or level of Python knowledge, even as the number of members has climbed above 140,000. Each day, Python Discord facilitates hundreds of live help sessions and numerous discussions in which both novices and experts participate.
In addition to creating a place where tens of thousands of people have learned about the Python ecosystem, they have maintained an active role by leading semi- annual code jam events (https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/) and creating the Sir Lancebot project (https://github.com/python-discord/sir- lancebot), which introduces beginners to open-source Python development.
In their work with other parts of the Python ecosystem, they have given the organisers of PyWeek a space in the community last year in order to increase the visibility of that long-standing event. They have also supported the PSF by hosting the most recent core developer sprint and the subsequent live Q&A stream.

For these reasons we believe that these three have done a great service to the Python language and ecosystem at large, and we hope that the committee will accept them as fellows.

=== Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich ===
''Briana Augenreich selected in Q1 of 2021''

I, Shanna Gregory, propose that Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the Leadership Fellows for the Women Who Code Python track community.

Bri and Archana have coordinated dozens of Python events for an international community and lead a team of dedicated volunteers who support Python study groups and speaker series. They have grown the WWCode Python community to over 2k active members. Both serve on the CFP Committee for Women Who Code CONNECT, a global developer conference series, and ensure quality Python presentations at each conference. 

=== Michael Iyanda ===
''Selected in Q3 of 2021''

I, Chukwudi Nwachukwu, propose that Michael Iyanda be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Michael is a proactive, and progressive member of the Python Community in Nigeria and he has dared go to where others couldn't go.

Michael lives in Bauchi State (Northern Nigeria) and he has been helping to push the Python Community in that domain for years, since I have known him. He did these by coaching, in the past, in many Django based events and even, at a time, acting as Python Nigeria's IT Director.

He exudes confidence in his tasks as he goes about doing his best to see such through. Plus, he is generous too. By being a Fellow of PSF and championing the Python cause where he resides and beyond, he will be able to create more awareness of the community. In my interactions with him, I do find him fit for the tasks ahead.

=== Zac Dodds ===
''Selected in Q1 of 2021''

I, Ryan Soklaski, propose that Zac Dodds be recognized as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Zac is a generous, proactive, and progressive member of the Python community and is a prolific contributor to Python’s ecosystem.

He is a developer for the Hypothesis testing project, and is, by far, its most active maintainer. This is a cutting-edge library that puts Python at the forefront of languages with advanced (but accessible) methods/tooling for writing automated tests for software. That he maintains a library of this caliber and importance in his free time is impressive indeed.

Zac is an active contributor to the various Python conferences; he has delivered talks, tutorials, and posters at PyCon, PyCon Australia, PyCon India, EuroSciPy, and others. In addition to delivering talks and tutorials, he also served as a mentor for PyCon’s mentored sprints for diverse beginners, and he often organizes a week-long sprint for people interested in Hypothesis.

In terms of the support that Zac provides to the Python ecosystem… it is downright herculean. He developed hypothesmith, which is a library that can generate valid Python programs to be tested. This is used to fuzz Instagram’s LibCST program, Black (the auto-formatter), and CPython itself. Zac has also contributed powerful property-based tests to pydantic, isort, caught bugs looming in Python 3.10, and much much more. His contributions go far beyond what I listed here.

The reason why I know Zac is that I posted an issue on Hypothesis, a couple of years ago, when I was trying to learn how to write tests for an educational tool that I was creating. This was one of my first experiences in the world of open-source software ever; I was nervous and a bad experience would have sent me packing. Zac was so kind, encouraging, and generous with the help he provided me that I felt motivated to become more active in the Python community – my life has changed because of this. No matter who he is interacting with, Zac is kind, inclusive, humble, and supportive. I model myself after him when I interact with people on GitHub and other platforms, and it makes me a better member of this community.

I could go on and on, but I hope that I have made a convincing case that Zac is an outstanding and admirable individual who makes the world of Python better in many different ways. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

''PSF Contributing Member''

=== Batuhan Osman Taskay ===
I, Taha Hamad, propose Batuhan Osman Taskaya be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation,
due to his remarkable contributions to the Python community in different fields. Although him being a high
school student, he is one of the most active contributors to the CPython project with over 100+ PRs (85+ merged, 20+ awaiting) (as can be seen from the Github UI) and an active triager on
the bug tracker. He has a special interest over the AST module, and he is continuously working on improving and extending that. Also, he is a member
of the tracker migration team for PEP 581/588. Additionally to the core Python itself, he is the author of many different static
analysis tools (including the InspectorTiger) and regular contributor of others. Current co-maintainer of the most used external Python
parser (with over 6 million downloads just from the previous month) that is dependant by Jedi, IPython, and many more.

From his record, it can be seen as he is a very active speaker on different events like FOSEM'19/'20 and EuroPython'19. The concept of these talks is mostly about discovering and hacking the internals of the CPython. As someone who seems like sharing information, he has 3 different blogs. The main one is a blog that is dedicated to ASTs and Python, and the second/third one is his personal blog about advanced Python in Turkish/English. He also organizes free Python trainings locally in Turkey, and advocation about Python in public events. As a community work, he is also one of the founding members of PyCon Turkey and a member of the talk selection committee. The first event of that organization is going to happen this September for the first time in Turkey. Besides that PyCon, while in this coronavirus crisis, he is part of Virtual PyIstanbul meetup, which is a weekly event that targets all Turkish speaking Pythonistas and happens every week without an exception.

=== Max Jakob ===
I, Anton Caceres, would like to nominate Max Jakob as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his prominent contributions to the Python community as a host and coorganizer of Munich Python User Group for over a decade. When the word "meetup" did not even exist, Max and his fellows have been meeting weekly at the university to discuss and promote Python. Max has always been supportive and enthusiastic about Python events, in particular, he proposed and took care of the venue for PyCon Germany in 2016 as well as hosted the first PyConWeb in 2017 in the LMU university. Those are only the cases where I was involved directly; apart from that Max was the chair of PySV (the German Python association), contributing to numerous Python activities in and outside of Germany. I know Max as a supportive but modest person, and I just wish that his prominent, systematic help would be properly recognized.

=== Andreas Klöckner ===
I, Roy Hyunjin Han, propose that Andreas Klöckner be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as the creator and tireless maintainer of numerous packages for debugging (pudb), high performance computing (pycuda, pyopencl), scientific computing (loopy, meshpy, pytential, boxtree, meshmode, pymbolic) and teaching (relate). Andreas was one of the pioneer researchers to associate Python with GPU computing through pycuda, which helped paved the way for Python to become known as the programming language for scientific computing and machine learning. Andreas continues to promote the use of Python in high performance computing and scientific computing through talks and he continues to create and improve innovative packages that I believe deserve greater recognition.

=== Carolina Ladino ===
I, Sebastián Ramírez, propose that Carolina Ladino be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to all her contributions to the Colombian Python community as a leader of several communities, including PyLadies Bogotá, her contributions to the organization of PyCon Colombia, and the communities for Machine Learning and Robotics.

=== Roy Hyunjin Han ===
I, Salah Ahmed, propose that Roy Hyunjin Han be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
Roy is a personal hero. If there's one major reason for his nomination, its not his technical prowess, but his unwavering belief in people. Roy is a Google Alumni and helped introduce Python to the NYC Mayor's office and to the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. He is the author of open source projects such as the python port of socket-io, as well as his prize project CrossCompute. Roy uses his expertise to train and mentor students at Queens College, free of charge. He does not take this matter lightly, he believes anyone can learn this profession and do it well. I first met Roy nearly 5 years ago, after graduating from NYU. I did not know any Python, and found it difficult to break into the industry. Today, I use Python exclusively, working a dream job at Resy. This would not be possible without Roy, he continues to mentor me, as well as numerous others. I cannot repay him for his belief in me, but I'd like to recognize him in the community. Roy makes it a point to make us feel apart of that community, taking us to Pycon and helping present at meetups! Please consider Roy.

''supporting member up to Nov 2019''

=== Ng Swee Meng ===
I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Ng Swee Meng (sweester@gmail.com) be
recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation

Swee Meng's contribution to the python community in Malaysia by being
the main organizer for regular python meetups (even at times when
attendance was below 10 people) even long before we had PyCon MY, and
was also the key person to initiate PyCon MY in 2015.
Hi tenacity to continue contributing by managing and evangelising for
python has made PyCon MY grow to be known as the biggest python
conference in Malaysia, and also one of the biggest and longest
continuing grass-roots led non-commercial tech conference in the
country.

Swee Meng also contributes to the SinarProject by writing code in
python. SinarProject is a civic tech initiative aiming to put
accountability on governments. His evangelism on using python in this
project has increased society's general awareness on what python is,
what it can do and how it can benefit society in general.

Comparatively to other countries, members of tech societies like in
Malaysia will have seemingly lesser contribution due to the general
attitude towards working in technology (i.e people are more interested
in selling than building stuff, and the idea of sharing like in open
source conferences do not catch on easily), and because of this I
believe we need to recognize and acknowledge selfless people like Swee
Meng, who can be made into role-models.

=== Martin Roelfs ===
I [Mauricio Moreira] would like to nominate Martin Roelfs (martin.roelfs@kuleuven.be), developer of SymFit, for the PSF Fellow Membership due to its continuous effort on building and maintaining a pythonic package for Symbolic Fit (https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit).

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Serhiy Storchaka ===
I, Andrew Svetlov, propose that Serhiy Storchaka be recognized as a
Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python language (the reference CPython
implementation). Hi is the Python Core Developer since 2012-12-26,
behind this date Serhiy is one of the most productive contributors to

=== Lumír Balhar ===
I, Honza Javorek, propose that Lumír Balhar <frenzy.madness@gmail.com> be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a

- founder and leader of the Python user group in Ostrava (since 2013)
- founder and lecturer of PyLadies Ostrava (since 2016, I think)
- co-founder of the Python user group in Olomouc (2017)
- main organizer, leader, and great motivator of the PyCon CZ org team for (at least) two consequent years (2019, 2020)
- organizer and host (in his own house) of yearly community Python sprints dedicated to improving what the Czech Python user group does

There are many people in the Czech Republic, who are very active in promoting Python, organizing Python events, and in overall making the world better through Python. Due to language barriers, our activities have mostly local impact, so the PSF doesn't have so many opportunities to hear about them. I'd like to start with internationally recognizing the great work being done here. I decided to propose Lumír as the first Czech PSF Fellow, because he stands out in following:

- operating in a post-industrial area of the country with high unemployment and basically no prior Python awareness and no Python companies
- building a local community completely from scratch, from enthusiasts and beginners, and leading it to being so robust that it was/is able to take over and successfully deliver the Czech Python user group conference, PyCon CZ (~400 attendees, previously 2015-2016 in Brno, 2017-2018 in Prague, both being major cities with abundance of Python software companies and volunteers)
- being persistent in his volunteering contributions for many years, seemingly without any burnouts, always spreading good mood and attitude
- being very humble in accepting any praise, perhaps not even realizing the sheer amount of good he has added to the world

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Marco Rougeth ===
I, Mário Sérgio, propose that Marco Rougeth should be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community. For the past year, he has coordinated the translation of Python documentation to Portuguese language, not only promoting more people to contribute, but also creating tools that help the work of those who want to help. The efforts include coordinating embassadors to organize sprints on local events, lightining talks, blog posts and even a bot that sends strings to be translated via Telegram. 
Marco was in the organization of several events, including 2 Pycon Brazil. He was also the creator of Caipyra, a conference that, in 2016, started the efforts of a local community that eventually ended on the Pycon Brazil being help on the same city in 2019. He also was a key organizer of this Pycon Brazil 2019, helping the organization from afar (Dublin). A work that was of extremely importance when the current organizer had to leave the conference due to health issues. 
Also, for the past 4 years, he has done a silent job as a advisor on the Python Brazil Association, engaging on the efforts of keeping the Brazil's community development. 
Most of this work has happened under the shadows, as many of our amazing community efforts, but it is my personal believe that he has done enough to be a fellow of PSF.

== 2019 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Paul Kehrer ===
I'd [Elana Hashman] like to nominate Paul Kehrer to be recognized as a Fellow of the 
Python Software Foundation as part of the 2019 Q3 batch.

Paul has served the Python community with his extensive engineering 
contributions with the Python Cryptographic Authority (PyCA) over the 
past six years. He is the #1 contributor to the "cryptography" project, 
which has over 2.9k stars on GitHub and ranks in the top 30 most 
downloaded packages from PyPI: 
https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/graphs/contributors

Without Paul's involvement in cryptography, pyOpenSSL, Python's bcrypt, 
PyNaCl, and upstream OpenSSL, the Python ecosystem would be a lot less 
secure.

He has also achieved wide acclaim for building the Simpsons meme 
generator Frinkiac, which, while not written in Python, has brought joy 
to many members of the Python community.

=== Bruno Oliveira ===
I, Edson Tadeu M. Manoel, propose that Bruno Oliveira (a.k.a. the pytest penguin) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a core maintainer of pytest, allowing test-writing to be a super joyous activity for every Python developer. Bruno is a pytest core maintainer since 2013, and is super active in the project

I, Denivy Braiam Ruck, propose that Bruno Oliveira be recognized as a Fellow of Python Software Foundation, due to his long-term contribution, passion and respect for the Python Community. His contributions go beyond his work as a core developer of pytest. He also contributes to meetups and conferences in and near his town (Florianópolis) and is constantly mentoring developers, such as myself. Me and many others have an immense respect for him due to his humble and humane approach when dealing with others and always giving his bits for whoever is in need. I have no doubts that the fellow chair of PSF will be honored by him with very high standards.

I, Marcelo Duarte Trevisani, propose that Bruno Oliveira be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Pytest (core developer), Tox, conda-forge, trio, conda, and several other projects.

He also wrote a book about Pytest, "Pytest Quick Start Guide". He was already recognized by Google regarding his contributions to the opensource community.

=== Batuhan Osman Taskaya ===
I , Mustafa Anıl Tuncel, propose Batuhan Osman Taskaya be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community in many positions. 
He is a high school student from Turkey, recently became 16. Although being young, he already has a remarkable amount of contributions to Python and its community. He is a strong advocate of Python, he even thinks people should start developing frontend with Python as he is doing with the darwcss/frutti [0] projects he developed.
He is the author of many hacking projects (such as catlizor[1], pepallow[2], rustyreturn[3]) that changes the behaviour of CPython and shows the ecosystem there is no such thing to be called impossible with CPython. He is the living proof of "CPython is the most dynamic interpreter". He has significant contributions to various other Python projects including CPython core [10]. 
He spoke at the largest FOSS conferences of Europe. Including the talk, he gave a talk about Memory Management in CPython at FOSDEM last year [4] and the talk about the security vulnerabilities of CPython at EuroPython this year [5].
He blogs in both English [6] and Turkish [7], about CPython's internals. He brought some unique reading material in Turkish and Python community in Turkey deeply appreciate his blog posts.
He also gives Python training (for free) as a Python advocate in Turkey. The upcoming training is going to happen in SCamp which is a summer camp for the young programmers (between 14- and 17-years old) [11]. There he is going to give Python training for 4 days.
Lately, he gives free consulting to floss projects under Three-Headed Giant Consulting [8] (a character from Monty Python). 
Last of all, as a community managing experience, he is the founder of a Telegram group [9] for the Python users of Turkey. He created that group for advocation Python usage and answering the questions of Pythonistas.
I truly believe that he is going to be a key person in advancing the mission of the PSF and with no doubt nominate him to become a PSF fellow.

=== Humphrey Butau ===
I, Katuri Charles, propose that Humphrey Butau be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as a founding member and chairman of the Zimbabwe Python User Group. He has endeavored in bringing the use of Python and related technologies into all spheres of Zimbabwean Society. Through his efforts, Zimbabwe has hosted 2 Pycon Events, a Django Indaba and is on track on hosting a the third edition of Pycon in Zimbabwe. He has encouraged the ordinary Zimbabwean to take up Python Coding as a skill. A special mention of this has to be made for his participation in setting up and running Django Girls Coaching Events. His selfless dedication goes above and beyond after you take into account he has to do this in a tough economic environment(Mind you the price I paid for Pycon 2018 is now worth less than half its value than what I paid for initially). He is keeping the Python Community alive and well in Zimbabwe. The only other similar community that exists is Wordpress, but it does not come close in comparison with what Humphrey & Team have achieved.

But lets not forget, he must be one of the few people who writes code exclusively using Vi in Zimbabwe. That deserves an award in itself.

=== Florian Bruhin (elected Q2 2019) ===
I, Rahul Jha, propose that Florian Bruhin[0] (aka The-Compiler) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community, mainly in the form of qutebrowser[1], which is a cross-platform web browser with vim-style key bindings and a minimal GUI written in Python using PyQt - for which he also received a CH Open Source award in 2016[2]. He is also a long term contributor and maintainer for pytest[3] and also helped out in the development of PySide[4]. Amongst his other achievements, he is also an operator in the #python IRC channel which reflects his love and eagerness to help fellow members of the community.

Apart from his in-numerous contributions to the Free and Libre Open Source Software, he has also mentored many people through the means of various open source programs, like  Google Summer of Code, Rails Girls Summer of Code, etc and having experienced the depth of knowledge and the love of teaching he has during my time being mentored by him for Google Summers of Code 2018, I believe becoming a Fellow of the PSF would help him become even more valuable to the community.

The organization has helped host Startup Row and has had amazing speakers such as Lukasz Langa, Raymond Hettinger, Alex Martelli to name a few. The meetup has a great mix of people: some are beginners that are in interested in learning a new skill, others are seasoned engineers that come to mingle. It's a beautiful community that I'm proud to be part of, and without Grace, it wouldn't have existed at all. Grace is the main organizer, everyone has heard about her, she has been running this meetup for the last 9 years. This is what she does for the event:

Reaches out to potential sponsor companies to find venues to host SF Python meetups Reaches out to potential sponsor companies to find food sponsors She connects people together Even though she does not have a technical background, she strives to learn and understand technical topics to stay up to date on what's going on in the Python community Reaches out to meetup attendees and tries to get them involved with running the meetup, giving everyone a chance to step up. Handles all logistics for anything that may be needed Is proactive about schedule organization, responding to any request that may appear on meetup.com She is proactive when any sudden change of plan happens She reaches out to speakers that she would love to see speaking and she encourages them to speak She is the first to come and the last to leave PyBay

PyBay is the SF Python's regional conference. I've not here to pitch PyBay, but you should check out our lineup! it's pretty cool. This is what Grace does for PyBay:

Grace invented PyBay! She also takes a lot of personal and financial risks to make PyBay succeed She finds solutions for when I or other organizers screw up and are not available She pushes to collaborate with organizations that can improve the diversity (gender, ethnicity, and social background) in the Python community.

=== Don Sheu (elected 2017) ===
I would like to propose Don Sheu as a fellow of the PSF.  Don has been one of the core coordinator of Startup Row at PyCon since 2014 and he is the founder of the Seattle Python user group.

In his role with the Startup Row, he has traveled to nearly a dozen cities to coordinate pitch nights, he has spent countless hours reaching out to young companies, potential judges, and reviewing applications. He has demonstrated diligence and availability to help selected companies arrange their trip to PyCon and get the most of the experience in the expo hall.

In his role as the founder of the Seattle Python User Group, he has reached out to numerous speakers, secured sponsorship agreements with local Python-using companies, and trained a team of a dozen co-organizers.  The Seattle Python user group features an active community of 4500 members on Meetup.com.  Bi-monthly meetups and project nights are routinely attended by over 150 members, which is largely thanks to Don's dedication in fostering this community that did not exist as recently as 5 years ago.

On top of the above, Don has been one of the instigator and is actively involved with PyCascades, a local conference targeting the Pacific Northwest of North America and that is well on it's way to have it's inaugural event in January 2017.

In light of these accomplishments and sustained dedication to fostering a strong Python community in Seattle and beyond, I would like Don to be considered as a fellow member of the PSF.

=== Cristoph Gohlke ===
I, Martin Gfeller, like to nominate Cristoph Gohlke (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) of Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine as PSF fellow. Christoph's repository of compiled Python packages (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) makes using Python on the Windows 64-bit much easier, and feasible for those without compiling skills. This contribution to the ecosystem shows technical excellence and dedication to keep all packages up to date. By making Python 3 version of packages available since quite some time, he also helped transition to Python 3 for Windows users. I believe his work is widely used, but not widely acclaimed, so in my opinion, he deserves recognition for this very valuable service. I had never a need to contact him, because the latest packages are always compiled and already there as soon as I have a need.

=== Manuel Kaufmann (elected 2017) ===
I, Johanna Sanchez, propose Manuel Kaufmann to be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python communities in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) with the project Argentina in Python (https://argentinaenpython.com).

Manuel Kaufmann has organized more than 50 events to promote and share knowledge about Python programming at different audience levels from beginner to advanced. Some of these events are registered in the "Past Events" section (https://argentinaenpython.com/eventos/#eventos-pasados). Within these spaces it has taken into account the inclusion of women in technology, organizing more than 15 Django Girls workshops throughout all Latin America. Gallery with a lot of pictures from most of all his events: - https://argentinaenpython.com/galeria/ Blog post written by others about his latest participation in events:- http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/165656387217/this-blog-post-was-written-by-jorge-namour-thank, - http://pybaq.co/blog/como-fue-organizar-primer-django-girls-barranquilla/ He is currently supporting the organizers of PyCon Colombia 2018 as a collaborator and nexus with the PSF as sponsor. - https://www.pycon.co Finally, has been invited to participate as Keynote Speaker in PyCon Spain 2016 (https://youtu.be/e0500NDu2tA) and will soon be in PyCon Brazil 2017.

- Nominated by Own Campbell May 2017

=== Daniele Procida (elected 2017) ===
Daniele has served the Python community through his sustained contributions to PyCon and DjangoCon conferences around the world as an organiser, speaker, mentor and teacher.

As the conference director for PyCon UK, he has overseen continuous growth in participation and has used that experience to help other conferences in their efforts to bring Python to a wider audience. A notable example is his work over three years to organise, establish and nurture PyCon Namibia to the point where it is now self-sustaining.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise DjangoCon Europe 2015  but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup (PyDiff) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded "Don't be afraid to commit" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier PyCon organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
