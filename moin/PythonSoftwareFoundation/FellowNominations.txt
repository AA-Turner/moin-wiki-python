=== Don Sheu ===
I would like to propose Don Sheu as a fellow of the PSF.  Don has been
one of the core coordinator of Startup Row at PyCon since 2014 and he is
the founder of the Seattle Python user group.

In his role with the Startup Row, he has traveled to nearly a dozen
cities to coordinate pitch nights, he has spent countless hours reaching
out to young companies, potential judges, and reviewing applications.
He has demonstrated diligence and availability to help selected
companies arrange their trip to PyCon and get the most of the experience
in the expo hall.

In his role as the founder of the Seattle Python User Group, he has
reached out to numerous speakers, secured sponsorship agreements with
local Python-using companies, and trained a team of a dozen
co-organizers.  The Seattle Python user group features an active
community of 4500 members on Meetup.com.  Bi-monthly meetups and project
nights are routinely attended by over 150 members, which is largely
thanks to Don's dedication in fostering this community that did not
exist as recently as 5 years ago.

On top of the above, Don has been one of the instigator and is actively
involved with PyCascades, a local conference targeting the Pacific
Northwest of North America and that is well on it's way to have it's
inaugural event in January 2017.

In light of these accomplishments and sustained dedication to fostering
a strong Python community in Seattle and beyond, I would like Don to be
considered as a fellow member of the PSF.

=== Donald Stufft ===
I, Nick Coghlan, propose that Donald Stufft be recognized as a Fellow
of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python community as the founder of the Warehouse
project to modernise the Python Package Index infrastructure, the
current lead maintainer for both pypi.python.org and pypi.org,
prolific contributor to the Python packaging tools ecosystem, and
co-creator and maintainer of the ensurepip module in the Python
standard library.

=== Piotr Dyba ===
I, Agata Skamruk (Bublewicz), propose that Piotr Dyba be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community. Peter is a organizer and mentor at the cyclical Pyladies workshop and a organizer and meta mentor at the weekend workshop. Has experience in Python projects, both in work and in social work. 

=== Russell Keith-Magee ===
I, Katie McLaughlin, propose that Russell Keith-Magee be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as, and not limited to:
 * 12 year (and counting) veteran of the Django core development team
 * 5 years (2011-2015) President of the Django Software Foundation
 * 5 years (2013-2017, and counting) Core Organiser of DjangoCon AU

 * BDFN (2013-present) of BeeWare, which on top of its technical goal of providing Python on all the platforms, serves as an incubator for first time FOSS/Python contributors
 * recipient of the 2015 Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize 

=== Cristoph Gohlke ===
I, Martin Gfeller, like to nominate Cristoph Gohlke (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) of Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine as PSF fellow. Christoph's repository of compiled Python packages (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) makes using Python on the Windows 64-bit much easier, and feasible for those without compiling skills. This contribution to the ecosystem shows technical excellence and dedication to keep all packages up to date. By making Python 3 version of packages available since quite some time, he also helped transition to Python 3 for Windows users. I believe his work is widely used, but not widely acclaimed, so in my opinion, he deserves recognition for this very valuable service. I had never a need to contact him, because the latest packages are always compiled and already there as soon as I have a need.

=== Manuel Kaufmann ===
I, Johanna Sanchez, propose Manuel Kaufmann to be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python communities in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) with the project Argentina in Python (https://argentinaenpython.com).

Manuel Kaufmann has organized more than 50 events to promote and share knowledge about Python programming at different audience levels from beginner to advanced. Some of these events are registered in the "Past Events" section (https://argentinaenpython.com/eventos/#eventos-pasados).
Within these spaces it has taken into account the inclusion of women in technology, organizing more than 15 Django Girls workshops throughout all Latin America. Gallery with a lot of pictures from most of all his events: - https://argentinaenpython.com/galeria/
Blog post written by others about his latest participation in events:- http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/165656387217/this-blog-post-was-written-by-jorge-namour-thank, - http://pybaq.co/blog/como-fue-organizar-primer-django-girls-barranquilla/
He is currently supporting the organizers of PyCon Colombia 2018 as a collaborator and nexus with the PSF as sponsor. - https://www.pycon.co
Finally, has been invited to participate as Keynote Speaker in PyCon Spain 2016 (https://youtu.be/e0500NDu2tA) and will soon be in PyCon Brazil 2017.

- Nominated by Own Campbell May 2017

=== Daniele Procida ===
Daniele has served the Python community through his sustained contributions to PyCon and DjangoCon conferences around the world as an organiser, speaker, mentor and teacher.

As the conference director for PyCon UK, he has overseen continuous growth in participation and has used that experience to help other conferences in their efforts to bring Python to a wider audience. A notable example is his work over three years to organise, establish and nurture PyCon Namibia to the point where it is now self-sustaining.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise DjangoCon Europe 2015  but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup (PyDiff) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded "Don't be afraid to commit" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier PyCon organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
