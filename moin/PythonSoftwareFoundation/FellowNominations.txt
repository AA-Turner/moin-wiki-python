== 2020 Q1 Nominations ==

=== Anthony Sottile ===
I, Hugo van Kemenade, propose that Anthony Sottile be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to significant contributions to the Python community, by building and maintaining many productivity tools. For example, for creating pre-commit and pyupgrade, as a core developer of pytest and tox, a maintainer of Flake8, amongst dozens of other tools.

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Jon Dufresne ===
I, Hugo van Kemenade, propose that Jon Dufresne be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to significant contributions to the Python community, as a core developer of Django and by contributing to scores of open-source Python projects, helping them modernise and standardise, follow current best practices in code, testing and packaging, replacing deprecations and dropping old Python support.

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Al Sweigart ===
I [Paul Vincent Craven] feel that Al Seigert should be a PSF fellow for all his work at Python education. 

I, Ewa Jodlowska, propose that Al Sweigart be recognized as a Fellow of the PSF due to their significant contributions to the Python community. Al wrote several books (many are freely available) and put together online videos teaching folks about Python. Additionally, Al has spoken at many Python conferences and wrote several Python libraries. More details can be found at https://alsweigart.com/.

''supporting member up to Nov 2019''

=== Ng Swee Meng ===
I, Iqbal Abdullah, propose that Ng Swee Meng (sweester@gmail.com) be
recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation

Swee Meng's contribution to the python community in Malaysia by being
the main organizer for regular python meetups (even at times when
attendance was below 10 people) even long before we had PyCon MY, and
was also the key person to initiate PyCon MY in 2015.
Hi tenacity to continue contributing by managing and evangelising for
python has made PyCon MY grow to be known as the biggest python
conference in Malaysia, and also one of the biggest and longest
continuing grass-roots led non-commercial tech conference in the
country.

Swee Meng also contributes to the SinarProject by writing code in
python. SinarProject is a civic tech initiative aiming to put
accountability on governments. His evangelism on using python in this
project has increased society's general awareness on what python is,
what it can do and how it can benefit society in general.

Comparatively to other countries, members of tech societies like in
Malaysia will have seemingly lesser contribution due to the general
attitude towards working in technology (i.e people are more interested
in selling than building stuff, and the idea of sharing like in open
source conferences do not catch on easily), and because of this I
believe we need to recognize and acknowledge selfless people like Swee
Meng, who can be made into role-models.

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Martin Roelfs ===
I [Mauricio Moreira] would like to nominate Martin Roelfs (martin.roelfs@kuleuven.be), developer of SymFit, for the PSF Fellow Membership due to its continuous effort on building and maintaining a pythonic package for Symbolic Fit (https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit).

He has served as Director of technology at Swahilipot Hub. He has empowered so many young people to learn programming.I am one of them. I am a python language beginner. 

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Serhiy Storchaka ===
I, Andrew Svetlov, propose that Serhiy Storchaka be recognized as a
Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python language (the reference CPython
implementation). Hi is the Python Core Developer since 2012-12-26,
behind this date Serhiy is one of the most productive contributors to
the Python project. I think it deserves the fellowship.

=== Lumír Balhar ===
I, Honza Javorek, propose that Lumír Balhar <frenzy.madness@gmail.com> be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a

- founder and leader of the Python user group in Ostrava (since 2013)
- founder and lecturer of PyLadies Ostrava (since 2016, I think)
- co-founder of the Python user group in Olomouc (2017)
- main organizer, leader, and great motivator of the PyCon CZ org team for (at least) two consequent years (2019, 2020)
- organizer and host (in his own house) of yearly community Python sprints dedicated to improving what the Czech Python user group does

There are many people in the Czech Republic, who are very active in promoting Python, organizing Python events, and in overall making the world better through Python. Due to language barriers, our activities have mostly local impact, so the PSF doesn't have so many opportunities to hear about them. I'd like to start with internationally recognizing the great work being done here. I decided to propose Lumír as the first Czech PSF Fellow, because he stands out in following:

- operating in a post-industrial area of the country with high unemployment and basically no prior Python awareness and no Python companies
- building a local community completely from scratch, from enthusiasts and beginners, and leading it to being so robust that it was/is able to take over and successfully deliver the Czech Python user group conference, PyCon CZ (~400 attendees, previously 2015-2016 in Brno, 2017-2018 in Prague, both being major cities with abundance of Python software companies and volunteers)
- being persistent in his volunteering contributions for many years, seemingly without any burnouts, always spreading good mood and attitude
- being very humble in accepting any praise, perhaps not even realizing the sheer amount of good he has added to the world

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Marco Rougeth ===
I, Mário Sérgio, propose that Marco Rougeth should be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community. For the past year, he has coordinated the translation of Python documentation to Portuguese language, not only promoting more people to contribute, but also creating tools that help the work of those who want to help. The efforts include coordinating embassadors to organize sprints on local events, lightining talks, blog posts and even a bot that sends strings to be translated via Telegram. 
Marco was in the organization of several events, including 2 Pycon Brazil. He was also the creator of Caipyra, a conference that, in 2016, started the efforts of a local community that eventually ended on the Pycon Brazil being help on the same city in 2019. He also was a key organizer of this Pycon Brazil 2019, helping the organization from afar (Dublin). A work that was of extremely importance when the current organizer had to leave the conference due to health issues. 
Also, for the past 4 years, he has done a silent job as a advisor on the Python Brazil Association, engaging on the efforts of keeping the Brazil's community development. 
Most of this work has happened under the shadows, as many of our amazing community efforts, but it is my personal believe that he has done enough to be a fellow of PSF.

which has over 2.9k stars on GitHub and ranks in the top 30 most 
downloaded packages from PyPI: 
https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/graphs/contributors

Without Paul's involvement in cryptography, pyOpenSSL, Python's bcrypt, 
PyNaCl, and upstream OpenSSL, the Python ecosystem would be a lot less 
secure.

He has also achieved wide acclaim for building the Simpsons meme 
generator Frinkiac, which, while not written in Python, has brought joy 
to many members of the Python community.

=== Bruno Oliveira ===
I, Edson Tadeu M.

He is the author of many hacking projects (such as catlizor[1], pepallow[2], rustyreturn[3]) that changes the behaviour of CPython and shows the ecosystem there is no such thing to be called impossible with CPython. He is the living proof of "CPython is the most dynamic interpreter". He has significant contributions to various other Python projects including CPython core [10]. 
He spoke at the largest FOSS conferences of Europe. Including the talk, he gave a talk about Memory Management in CPython at FOSDEM last year [4] and the talk about the security vulnerabilities of CPython at EuroPython this year [5].
He blogs in both English [6] and Turkish [7], about CPython's internals. He brought some unique reading material in Turkish and Python community in Turkey deeply appreciate his blog posts.
He also gives Python training (for free) as a Python advocate in Turkey. The upcoming training is going to happen in SCamp which is a summer camp for the young programmers (between 14- and 17-years old) [11]. There he is going to give Python training for 4 days.
Lately, he gives free consulting to floss projects under Three-Headed Giant Consulting [8] (a character from Monty Python). 
Last of all, as a community managing experience, he is the founder of a Telegram group [9] for the Python users of Turkey. He created that group for advocation Python usage and answering the questions of Pythonistas.
I truly believe that he is going to be a key person in advancing the mission of the PSF and with no doubt nominate him to become a PSF fellow.

He has endeavored in bringing the use of Python and related technologies into all spheres of Zimbabwean Society. Through his efforts, Zimbabwe has hosted 2 Pycon Events, a Django Indaba and is on track on hosting a the third edition of Pycon in Zimbabwe. He has encouraged the ordinary Zimbabwean to take up Python Coding as a skill. A special mention of this has to be made for his participation in setting up and running Django Girls Coaching Events. His selfless dedication goes above and beyond after you take into account he has to do this in a tough economic environment(Mind you the price I paid for Pycon 2018 is now worth less than half its value than what I paid for initially). He is keeping the Python Community alive and well in Zimbabwe. The only other similar community that exists is Wordpress, but it does not come close in comparison with what Humphrey & Team have achieved.

But lets not forget, he must be one of the few people who writes code exclusively using Vi in Zimbabwe. That deserves an award in itself.

=== Yury Selivanov (elected 2018) ===
I, Łukasz Langa, propose that Yury Selivanov be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his enormous contributions to asynchronous programming in CPython. He has been a core developer for over four years now. In this time, he authored over 900 commits, was involved in 6 PEPs, four of which he's the sole author of. His single biggest contribution is the inclusion of the async/await syntax to the language by PEP 492 and later extended with PEP 525, PEP 530, and PEP 567.

async/await was pivotal in making asyncio a first-class component of Python and is widely cited as one of the Top 3 killer features of Python 3 that drive its adoption. Possibly Top 1 but I can't admit to this as I also have a horse in this race. Anyway, the list of PSF fellows is incomplete without Yury.

As far as I could go into the history of the websites: https://pl.pycon.org/2010/organizatorzy.html in 2010 he was part of the organizational team. And as far as the talks go the first PyCon PL was in 2007 and Filip was there as well (I have no proof, this is just word of mouth). Filip is active in the community more than a decade and he does the volunteering work. Therefore I think Filip's work should be officially recognized! I have started to organize PyCon SK in 2015 and we had the first conference in 2016 and Filip was the supporting community member who went the extra mile and came to Bratislava to out very first meetup to support the community growth. We told him our ideas about PyCon  SK and he was willing to share his 8 years of experience with PyCon PL. Without him, we wouldn't be able to organize our first conference at such high level.

I would like to propose Don Sheu as a fellow of the PSF.  Don has been one of the core coordinator of Startup Row at PyCon since 2014 and he is the founder of the Seattle Python user group.

In his role with the Startup Row, he has traveled to nearly a dozen cities to coordinate pitch nights, he has spent countless hours reaching out to young companies, potential judges, and reviewing applications. He has demonstrated diligence and availability to help selected companies arrange their trip to PyCon and get the most of the experience in the expo hall.

In his role as the founder of the Seattle Python User Group, he has reached out to numerous speakers, secured sponsorship agreements with local Python-using companies, and trained a team of a dozen co-organizers.  The Seattle Python user group features an active community of 4500 members on Meetup.com.

=== Cristoph Gohlke ===
I, Martin Gfeller, like to nominate Cristoph Gohlke (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) of Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine as PSF fellow. Christoph's repository of compiled Python packages (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) makes using Python on the Windows 64-bit much easier, and feasible for those without compiling skills. This contribution to the ecosystem shows technical excellence and dedication to keep all packages up to date. By making Python 3 version of packages available since quite some time, he also helped transition to Python 3 for Windows users. I believe his work is widely used, but not widely acclaimed, so in my opinion, he deserves recognition for this very valuable service.

=== Brian Ray ===
I, Don Sheu, propose that Brian Ray founder of Chicago Python user group is recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community of organizing one of the oldest and largest user groups in the world for over 12 years. Chicago Python ("ChiPy") has fostered such important contributors to Python and computer science like Aaron Swartz the creator of RSS and founder of Reddit, Adrian Holovaty the creator of Django, Mike Cafarella creator of Hadoop, John Hunter creator of MatPlotLib, and Harper Reed the CTO for the Obama for America campaign and credited with winning the 2012 election. Brian has also contributed to and launched open source and free software projects.

=== Dusty Phillips (elected 2017) ===
I, Don Sheu, propose that Dusty Phillips author of Python 3 Object Oriented Programming and Production Engineer at Facebook is recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. In addition to his significant contributions as an author of high quality books on Python subjects, Dusty founded Puget Sound Programming Python ("PuPPy") in August 2014. In less than a year, PuPPy has attracted nearly 1000 members and holds monthly meetings that draw over 100. The most recent meeting in June hosted by Google drew attendance of over 170. Dusty booked speakers like Larry Hastings, Lukasz Langa, Jack Diederich, Carlos Guestrin, and several founders of successful Python-using Seattle startups.

=== Peter Inglesby (elected 2017) ===
Peter has served the UK Python community through his extraordinary efforts to ensure the continuity of the PyCon UK conference. Under his tenure, the size of the conference has grown continuously as has the team of voluntary organisers.

His leadership has ensured the longevity of the event and the continued existence and improvement of a vital event in the life of the UK Python community.

- Nominated by Own Campbell May 2017

=== Daniele Procida (elected 2017) ===
Daniele has served the Python community through his sustained contributions to PyCon and DjangoCon conferences around the world as an organiser, speaker, mentor and teacher.

As the conference director for PyCon UK, he has overseen continuous growth in participation and has used that experience to help other conferences in their efforts to bring Python to a wider audience. A notable example is his work over three years to organise, establish and nurture PyCon Namibia to the point where it is now self-sustaining.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise DjangoCon Europe 2015  but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup (PyDiff) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded "Don't be afraid to commit" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier PyCon organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
