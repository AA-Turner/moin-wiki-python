=== Ana Dulce ===
I, Marco Rougeth, propose that Ana Dulce be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Ana Dulce has been doing great work in the brazilian Python community for quite some time. More recently, she took the lead when nobody else wanted and organized Python Brasil conference in 2020 (first time online edition). She was also a key member of the organization team in the 2019 and 2021 editions of the conference.

Ana has been around since PyLadies Brasil was created in 2014 and she also has been an active member of the Sao Carlos' PyLadies branch. Over the years, she organized several meetups and study groups, taught programming to young girls from elementary and hight schools, gave talks and tutorials, helped with social media. The list goes on and on.

She likes to says that she prefers the "background" type of work in the community, mostly likely why she hasn't been recognized as a PSF Fellow yet.


=== Aidis Stukas ===
I, Harald Armin Massa, propose that Aidis Stukas be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I nominate him because of his significant contributions to the Python community. Aidis has been serving as the chair of PyCon Lithuania (PyCon LT) since 2017. While serving as chair of PyCon LT, he grew the conference from ~80 participants to ~330 participants, from a single day event into a 2 day event in 2019, with 10+ foreign speakers, 4 tracks, a Django girls session. Even more significant, he travelled to EuroPython (with the help of a PSF grant) to connect with international Pythonistas, to recruit them to come to Lithuania and speak at PyCon LT. In my eyes, crossing the boarder and connecting one national Python community with the global Python world is a very important step. Beyond chairing the event, he also developed and engaged a team of Pythonistas to run the conference, motivated Mantas Zimnickas, Jurgis Pralgauskis, Laurynas Speiƒçys, Inga Pliavgo, Dainora Bucyte and some others to work on the conference. In addition to PyCon LT, Aidis organizes mutliple Python Meetups in Lithuania: KaunasPy (www.meetup.com/KaunasPy/). PyData Kaunas (www.meetup.com/PyData-Kaunas/)  

Also nominated by Mike M√ºller

=== Arnaud Legout ===
I, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Gerbeau, propose that Arnaud Legout and Thierry Parmentelat be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as co-authors of the most popular MOOC on Python in the French speaking countries. This MOOC, first created in 2014, and largely updated with the latest Python progress, reached 110,000 students in 101 countries. It is the official resource for all French high schools and undergrad professors to learn Python. Therefore, this MOOC has structured the learning Python in France. The nominees have also made a significant contribution to the use of the Python notebook in educational resources by using it since 2014 in the first edition of their MOOC Python.

=== Thierry Parmentelat ===

=== Thomas Caswell ===
I, Madicken Munk, would like to nominate Thomas Caswell to be recognized as a fellow of the python software foundation. Thomas Caswell is the current project lead  of Matplotlib, the most widely used plotting package in the scientific Python community and I can't recommend him enough for this honor. Tom is a thoughtful leader that thinks about the software he maintains and how it fits into the broader scientific Python ecosystem, and is an active participant and organizer of scientific Python events. 

Tom is a strong leader guiding matplotlib into the future. He seeks out independent funding to ensure stability in matplotlib's development and maintenance, and is broadly welcoming and encouraging to all contributors to the project and to people joining the scientific Python community. Under Tom's leadership, a number of people have dedicated funding to develop and work on matplotlib, and matplotlib's community has grown as a result. Because matplotlib serves as a backend for many other scientific Python visualization packages like my own, their stability and maintenance benefits the development communities of many other packages. 

For the past several years Tom has co-organized the tools plenary at SciPy, which involves reaching out to various maintainers of projects in the scientific python ecosystem. Tom is thoughtful about how these packages are chosen, and tries to balance well-known core projects with newer projects that need an introduction to the community. At SciPy, Tom sought out other visualization package leaders to come up with standards for interoperability between visualization packages, making working in the ecosystem easier for users. Tom is always present during the sprints after SciPy concludes, and takes time to mentor potential contributors to matplotlib. Tom also was one of the individuals who spearheaded the effort for NEP 29, which set standards for when various Python versions would be supported and dropped in scientific python packages. This was a huge benefit to package maintainers like myself, and has been widely adopted by many core packages. 

=== Reshama Shaikh ===
I (Gael Varoquaux) would like to nominate Reshama Shaikh as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I am interacting with Reshama via scikit-learn. In addition to her technical contributions, she does an amazing work on community and communication, organizing sprints, animating our social medias, and overall helping shaping the community by suggesting good people. She is hard at work on diversity and inclusion, with manners and messages so gentle that they make everybody happy. She has an incredibly good spirit and is really committed to building a better Python ecosystem. I know that she is active on other projects beyond scikit-learn.

=== Matteo Benci ===
I, Patrick Arminio, nominate Matteo Benci. He's currently the treasurer of Python Italia, which is
already a very important role, but in addition to that he's helping a lot with the organization
of PyCon Italy and all the other events we try to do (PyFest, Django Girls and so). He's probably the most active member in our community and I think his involvement should be rewarded üòä I don't think we'd be able to do all the amazing things we do without him. He was interviewed recently about his community involvement, unfortunately the interview is only in italian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnFMaxZgsI

== 2021 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Anthony Sottile ===
I, J√ºrgen Gmach, propose that Anthony Sottile be recognized as a
Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages:
- pytest
- flake8
- tox
- pre-commit
- all-repos
- pyupgrade
and many more.

He also maintains the deadsnake-ppa, which enables all Ubuntu users to
install Python versions via a package manager which are not included
by Ubuntu by default.

He shares his knowledge via YouTube, via Twitch streams and also
online at his discourse board.

He also fixes critical bugs in cpython or never hesitates to help
other open source maintainers with extremely difficult problems.

The Python world would be very different without him.

=== Bern√°t G√°bor ===
I, J√ºrgen Gmach, propose that Bern√°t G√°bor be recognized as a Fellow
of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python community.

He maintains several indispensable Python packages:
- tox
- virtualenv
- build
- pipx
and many more.

He shares his knowledge on various discord channels.

One thing I admire most - he tries to empower new contributors, by
supporting them to create Pull Requests, but also he tries to get new
contributors into becoming future maintainers, and he spends a
significant time preparing them for future tasks.

The Python world would be very different without him.

== 2021 Q2 Nominations ==

=== Jo√£o Bueno ===
I, Bruno Rocha, propose that Jo√£o Bueno (a.k.a JS) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python and open-source software community.

He is one of the most active users of stack overflow answering all kinds of Python related questions both in English and Portuguese, the total number of answers he has selected there is awesome, too many newcomers and experienced developers have been helped by him.

He is one of the founding members of Python Brasil Association and Conference, co-founder of a hacker space and an excellent teacher and speaker on meetups and conferences.

JS is one of the smartest developers I know and he was a great source of inspiration when I started my career as a Python developer many years ago.

And most importantly, he is one of the core developers of GIMP (our lovely Linux Imaging Editing software)

=== Jakub Bal√°≈° ===
I, Tomas Pytel, propose that Jakub Bal√°≈° be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a co-organiser of the monthly python meetups called "Brnƒõnsk√© Pyvo" in Czech Republic. Also, he is always helpful when I talk with him about Slovak Meetups - Bratislava Python Meetup, where I am a co-organizer.

Jakub is also a regular speaker at PyConSK where I think he is a big popularizer of python in the space industry, and his talks have always filled the biggest halls of PyConSK. As much as possible during the conference, he actively communicated with the participants and IMHO it was really visible that he is fully dedicated to Python. I think he, as a PyConSK speaker, back then helped us in organizing PyConSK, so he was actively searching/looking for us speakers in Britain when he worked there. This helped us, for example, to get one or two more good speakers. Really, as I've seen it later when meetups are dying for lack of interest, Jakub is really trying to make the Czech community around python really live and be really active, and I think he's doing very well.

=== Sony Valdez ===
I, Sony Valdez, propose myself to be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. I have made significant contributions to the Python community as a co-founder of Python.PH in 2013, served as president from 2013 to 2016, currently serve as Board of Trustee in said organization as Director of Community Relations, chairman for PyCon Philippines 2014 and 2015, help organized PyCon Philippines from 2016 to 2019, pioneered teaching Python in education at our country back in 2011, and a long time contributor to the local Python community in the Philippines.


=== Jukka Lehtosalo, Ivan Levkivskyi, and Michael J. Sullivan ===
I, Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez, propose that Jukka Lehtosalo, Ivan Levkivskyi, and Michael J. Sullivan be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community with their work on mypy.

mypy lead to the development and integration of type annotations/type hints to the language itself. 

And these type annotations have improved code safety in many code bases (using mypy), the developer experience with editors supporting these type annotations, and new tools like dataclasses in the standard library, and other tools from the community, like pydantic, FastAPI, Typer, and many others.

=== Mikhail Kashkin ===
My name is Mikhail Kashkin and I want to nominate myself as PSF Fellow Member.
This is my story:
In 2000, I've started to work on my first paid office job. And my first project was on Perl. After year of development I found that I barely understand my own code and when I need to fix something I tend to rewrite code from scratch instead of changing it. Because Perl syntax was just unreadable. So, I decided to look into other programming languages and found Python ‚Äî clean and beautiful language. That becomes my love and main language for the next 20 years. 
When I started to learn python it was hard to find documentation in Russian language, my mother tongue. Lack of documentation and knowledge led me to mail lists. I started to teach myself Python by asking help from the community and feel that I need to pay back. That is how I become active community member and soon promoter of the Python. In few years I become the first member of the Plone Foundation from ex-USSR countries. My company Key Solutions was listed as solution provider and python developers company on many sites (it that times it was popular). Also, my employer and colleague Andrey Orlov was paid maintainer for Python builds in AltLinux distribution (http://sisyphus.ru/ru/srpm/Branch3/rpm-build-python/changelog). And author of the Python Policy for that distribution. 
I created the site Plone.org.ru to unite people who are interested in Plone, Zope and Python. Later I passed maintenance of the site to the community, but you can see that most news posts are from me here https://plone.org.ru/newsitems/. My username on this site is `xen`. I've coordinated translation to Russian of Plone book (https://plone.org.ru/books/pb/ru/) and made proofreading and formatting of the content contributed by other people. BTW, I'm not sure about rights to this book. We didn't sell it, so I hope it doesn't violate somebody's rights.
During Key Solution times I've created more than 100 sites using Python. Include some big names: Association CRM of Russia and CIS, Russia Sport Channel, and biggest real estate agency MIEL.ru. As active open source contributor I won award Open Source Contributor 3rd place by opennet.ru site http://www.opennet.ru/konkurs/result-1.shtml (in Russian).
From 2008 year I moved to Ukraine and become one of co-organizer of the PyCon Ukraine conference as keynote speaker. Solo I organized events in Dnipro, Lviv, Odessa, Kharkhiv. But not only in Ukraine. During my business or holiday travels I've become speaker in Thailand, Armenia, Russia. Some videos from events are available on my Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0xkFZv2Df0&list=PLyUvGavKi98XnK4xwtsmwrtYdYoUnnxQk. 
Two years ago (in 2018) I decided to start consulting and education projects. Soon one of my clients becomes Yandex and I created big part of Backend Developer course  https://praktikum.yandex.ru/backend-developer/. In the first month after started courses team shared numbers I can't say exactly how many people become students and numbers was impressive. More important that I saw students code. It was very good. I'm proud to be process that give these people the chance to become Python developers.

Now I run my own python education course on https://Pylot.me and education platform https://Okumy.com.

To sum things up:
- I have always worked closely with the community
- As speaker participated in more than 100 events in last 20 years
- Helped hundreds of people to start using Python
- Worked with the biggest IT companies as python expert. Including: Google, Yandex, Mamba, etc 
- A lot of people associate my name to Python
- Helped to translate or wrote a lot of articles about Python or how to become Python developer
- Contributed to Plone (was Foundation Member), Zope, and other projects
- Run python teams and promoted Python as basic technology in many startups I had envolved

== 2021 Q1 Nominations ==

=== Joseph Banks, Leon Sand√∏y, and Sebastiaan Zeeff ===
The Python Discord staff proposes that Joseph Banks, Leon Sand√∏y, and Sebastiaan Zeeff be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the owners of Python Discord.

Python Discord is a community for Python learning and discussion that has been active since 2017, and in that time they have worked diligently to foster a culture of warmth and inclusivity for all individuals regardless of their background or level of Python knowledge, even as the number of members has climbed above 140,000. Each day, Python Discord facilitates hundreds of live help sessions and numerous discussions in which both novices and experts participate.
In addition to creating a place where tens of thousands of people have learned about the Python ecosystem, they have maintained an active role by leading semi- annual code jam events (https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/) and creating the Sir Lancebot project (https://github.com/python-discord/sir- lancebot), which introduces beginners to open-source Python development.
In their work with other parts of the Python ecosystem, they have given the organisers of PyWeek a space in the community last year in order to increase the visibility of that long-standing event. They have also supported the PSF by hosting the most recent core developer sprint and the subsequent live Q&A stream.

For these reasons we believe that these three have done a great service to the Python language and ecosystem at large, and we hope that the committee will accept them as fellows.

=== Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich ===
I, Shanna Gregory, propose that Archana Vaidheeswaran and Briana Augenreich be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community as the Leadership Fellows for the Women Who Code Python track community.

Bri and Archana have coordinated dozens of Python events for an international community and lead a team of dedicated volunteers who support Python study groups and speaker series. They have grown the WWCode Python community to over 2k active members. Both serve on the CFP Committee for Women Who Code CONNECT, a global developer conference series, and ensure quality Python presentations at each conference. 

=== Michael Iyanda ===
I, Chukwudi Nwachukwu, propose that Michael Iyanda be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Michael is a proactive, and progressive member of the Python Community in Nigeria and he has dared go to where others couldn't go.

Michael lives in Bauchi State (Northern Nigeria) and he has been helping to push the Python Community in that domain for years, since I have known him. He did these by coaching, in the past, in many Django based events and even, at a time, acting as Python Nigeria's IT Director.

He exudes confidence in his tasks as he goes about doing his best to see such through. Plus, he is generous too. By being a Fellow of PSF and championing the Python cause where he resides and beyond, he will be able to create more awareness of the community. In my interactions with him, I do find him fit for the tasks ahead.

=== Zac Dodds ===
I, Ryan Soklaski, propose that Zac Dodds be recognized as a fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Zac is a generous, proactive, and progressive member of the Python community and is a prolific contributor to Python‚Äôs ecosystem.

He is a developer for the Hypothesis testing project, and is, by far, its most active maintainer. This is a cutting-edge library that puts Python at the forefront of languages with advanced (but accessible) methods/tooling for writing automated tests for software. That he maintains a library of this caliber and importance in his free time is impressive indeed.

Zac is an active contributor to the various Python conferences; he has delivered talks, tutorials, and posters at PyCon, PyCon Australia, PyCon India, EuroSciPy, and others. In addition to delivering talks and tutorials, he also served as a mentor for PyCon‚Äôs mentored sprints for diverse beginners, and he often organizes a week-long sprint for people interested in Hypothesis.

In terms of the support that Zac provides to the Python ecosystem‚Ä¶ it is downright herculean. He developed hypothesmith, which is a library that can generate valid Python programs to be tested. This is used to fuzz Instagram‚Äôs LibCST program, Black (the auto-formatter), and CPython itself. Zac has also contributed powerful property-based tests to pydantic, isort, caught bugs looming in Python 3.10, and much much more. His contributions go far beyond what I listed here.

The reason why I know Zac is that I posted an issue on Hypothesis, a couple of years ago, when I was trying to learn how to write tests for an educational tool that I was creating. This was one of my first experiences in the world of open-source software ever; I was nervous and a bad experience would have sent me packing. Zac was so kind, encouraging, and generous with the help he provided me that I felt motivated to become more active in the Python community ‚Äì my life has changed because of this. No matter who he is interacting with, Zac is kind, inclusive, humble, and supportive. I model myself after him when I interact with people on GitHub and other platforms, and it makes me a better member of this community.

I could go on and on, but I hope that I have made a convincing case that Zac is an outstanding and admirable individual who makes the world of Python better in many different ways. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.



== 2020 Q4 Nominations ==

=== Philip James ===
I [Jeff Triplett] want to recommend Philip James for your consideration as a PSF Fellow.

As a member of both the committee and a Director, I thought he did a brilliant job. Philip has also chaired the WG for two years and leads bi-weekly meetings to ensure that issues are resolved and discussed in a timely manner. I have served on dozens of WGs and Code of Conduct WGs are hard and Philip manages this duty with thought and care. 

Philip is also a contributor to the BeeWare project, is a long-time member of the Django community, has spoken at many community conferences including PyCon and DjangoCon(s), has volunteered as an organizer at conferences like DjangoCon US, and has helped organize meetups.

=== Batuhan Osman Taskay ===
I, Taha Hamad, propose Batuhan Osman Taskaya be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation,
due to his remarkable contributions to the Python community in different fields. Although him being a high
school student, he is one of the most active contributors to the CPython project with over 100+ PRs (85+ merged, 20+ awaiting) (as can be seen from the Github UI) and an active triager on
the bug tracker. He has a special interest over the AST module, and he is continuously working on improving and extending that. Also, he is a member
of the tracker migration team for PEP 581/588. Additionally to the core Python itself, he is the author of many different static
analysis tools (including the InspectorTiger) and regular contributor of others. Current co-maintainer of the most used external Python
parser (with over 6 million downloads just from the previous month) that is dependant by Jedi, IPython, and many more.

From his record, it can be seen as he is a very active speaker on different events like FOSEM'19/'20 and EuroPython'19. The concept of these talks is mostly about discovering and hacking the internals of the CPython. As someone who seems like sharing information, he has 3 different blogs. The main one is a blog that is dedicated to ASTs and Python, and the second/third one is his personal blog about advanced Python in Turkish/English. He also organizes free Python trainings locally in Turkey, and advocation about Python in public events. As a community work, he is also one of the founding members of PyCon Turkey and a member of the talk selection committee. The first event of that organization is going to happen this September for the first time in Turkey. Besides that PyCon, while in this coronavirus crisis, he is part of Virtual PyIstanbul meetup, which is a weekly event that targets all Turkish speaking Pythonistas and happens every week without an exception.

was also the key person to initiate PyCon MY in 2015.
Hi tenacity to continue contributing by managing and evangelising for
python has made PyCon MY grow to be known as the biggest python
conference in Malaysia, and also one of the biggest and longest
continuing grass-roots led non-commercial tech conference in the
country.

Swee Meng also contributes to the SinarProject by writing code in
python. SinarProject is a civic tech initiative aiming to put
accountability on governments. His evangelism on using python in this
project has increased society's general awareness on what python is,
what it can do and how it can benefit society in general.

Comparatively to other countries, members of tech societies like in
Malaysia will have seemingly lesser contribution due to the general
attitude towards working in technology (i.e people are more interested
in selling than building stuff, and the idea of sharing like in open
source conferences do not catch on easily), and because of this I
believe we need to recognize and acknowledge selfless people like Swee
Meng, who can be made into role-models.

=== Serhiy Storchaka ===
I, Andrew Svetlov, propose that Serhiy Storchaka be recognized as a
Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant
contributions to the Python language (the reference CPython
implementation). Hi is the Python Core Developer since 2012-12-26,
behind this date Serhiy is one of the most productive contributors to
the Python project. I think it deserves the fellowship.

=== Lum√≠r Balhar ===
I, Honza Javorek, propose that Lum√≠r Balhar <frenzy.madness@gmail.com> be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a

- founder and leader of the Python user group in Ostrava (since 2013)
- founder and lecturer of PyLadies Ostrava (since 2016, I think)
- co-founder of the Python user group in Olomouc (2017)
- main organizer, leader, and great motivator of the PyCon CZ org team for (at least) two consequent years (2019, 2020)
- organizer and host (in his own house) of yearly community Python sprints dedicated to improving what the Czech Python user group does

There are many people in the Czech Republic, who are very active in promoting Python, organizing Python events, and in overall making the world better through Python. Due to language barriers, our activities have mostly local impact, so the PSF doesn't have so many opportunities to hear about them. I'd like to start with internationally recognizing the great work being done here. I decided to propose Lum√≠r as the first Czech PSF Fellow, because he stands out in following:

- operating in a post-industrial area of the country with high unemployment and basically no prior Python awareness and no Python companies
- building a local community completely from scratch, from enthusiasts and beginners, and leading it to being so robust that it was/is able to take over and successfully deliver the Czech Python user group conference, PyCon CZ (~400 attendees, previously 2015-2016 in Brno, 2017-2018 in Prague, both being major cities with abundance of Python software companies and volunteers)
- being persistent in his volunteering contributions for many years, seemingly without any burnouts, always spreading good mood and attitude
- being very humble in accepting any praise, perhaps not even realizing the sheer amount of good he has added to the world

''Not a PSF Member''

=== Marco Rougeth ===
I, M√°rio S√©rgio, propose that Marco Rougeth should be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community. For the past year, he has coordinated the translation of Python documentation to Portuguese language, not only promoting more people to contribute, but also creating tools that help the work of those who want to help. The efforts include coordinating embassadors to organize sprints on local events, lightining talks, blog posts and even a bot that sends strings to be translated via Telegram. 
Marco was in the organization of several events, including 2 Pycon Brazil. He was also the creator of Caipyra, a conference that, in 2016, started the efforts of a local community that eventually ended on the Pycon Brazil being help on the same city in 2019. He also was a key organizer of this Pycon Brazil 2019, helping the organization from afar (Dublin). A work that was of extremely importance when the current organizer had to leave the conference due to health issues. 
Also, for the past 4 years, he has done a silent job as a advisor on the Python Brazil Association, engaging on the efforts of keeping the Brazil's community development. 
Most of this work has happened under the shadows, as many of our amazing community efforts, but it is my personal believe that he has done enough to be a fellow of PSF.

== 2019 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Paul Kehrer ===
I'd [Elana Hashman] like to nominate Paul Kehrer to be recognized as a Fellow of the 
Python Software Foundation as part of the 2019 Q3 batch.

Paul has served the Python community with his extensive engineering 
contributions with the Python Cryptographic Authority (PyCA) over the 
past six years. He is the #1 contributor to the "cryptography" project, 
which has over 2.9k stars on GitHub and ranks in the top 30 most 
downloaded packages from PyPI: 
https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/graphs/contributors

Without Paul's involvement in cryptography, pyOpenSSL, Python's bcrypt, 
PyNaCl, and upstream OpenSSL, the Python ecosystem would be a lot less 
secure.

He has also achieved wide acclaim for building the Simpsons meme 
generator Frinkiac, which, while not written in Python, has brought joy 
to many members of the Python community.

=== Bruno Oliveira ===
I, Edson Tadeu M. Manoel, propose that Bruno Oliveira (a.k.a. the pytest penguin) be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a core maintainer of pytest, allowing test-writing to be a super joyous activity for every Python developer. Bruno is a pytest core maintainer since 2013, and is super active in the project

I, Denivy Braiam Ruck, propose that Bruno Oliveira be recognized as a Fellow of Python Software Foundation, due to his long-term contribution, passion and respect for the Python Community. His contributions go beyond his work as a core developer of pytest. He also contributes to meetups and conferences in and near his town (Florian√≥polis) and is constantly mentoring developers, such as myself. Me and many others have an immense respect for him due to his humble and humane approach when dealing with others and always giving his bits for whoever is in need. I have no doubts that the fellow chair of PSF will be honored by him with very high standards.

I, Marcelo Duarte Trevisani, propose that Bruno Oliveira be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Pytest (core developer), Tox, conda-forge, trio, conda, and several other projects.

His website is a reference in France (the most visited for french tutorials on Python). 

He is fully committed to the Python community and programming. He never counts his time to promote Python programming and always promote open source and "data for good" actions (he organized several Hackathon to help Red Cross and other volunteer association). I am fully convinced that he fits with requirements you mentioned to be nominated.

=== Batuhan Osman Taskaya ===
I , Mustafa Anƒ±l Tuncel, propose Batuhan Osman Taskaya be recognised as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community in many positions. 
He is a high school student from Turkey, recently became 16. Although being young, he already has a remarkable amount of contributions to Python and its community. He is a strong advocate of Python, he even thinks people should start developing frontend with Python as he is doing with the darwcss/frutti [0] projects he developed.
He is the author of many hacking projects (such as catlizor[1], pepallow[2], rustyreturn[3]) that changes the behaviour of CPython and shows the ecosystem there is no such thing to be called impossible with CPython. He is the living proof of "CPython is the most dynamic interpreter". He has significant contributions to various other Python projects including CPython core [10]. 
He spoke at the largest FOSS conferences of Europe. Including the talk, he gave a talk about Memory Management in CPython at FOSDEM last year [4] and the talk about the security vulnerabilities of CPython at EuroPython this year [5].
He blogs in both English [6] and Turkish [7], about CPython's internals. He brought some unique reading material in Turkish and Python community in Turkey deeply appreciate his blog posts.
He also gives Python training (for free) as a Python advocate in Turkey. The upcoming training is going to happen in SCamp which is a summer camp for the young programmers (between 14- and 17-years old) [11]. There he is going to give Python training for 4 days.
Lately, he gives free consulting to floss projects under Three-Headed Giant Consulting [8] (a character from Monty Python). 
Last of all, as a community managing experience, he is the founder of a Telegram group [9] for the Python users of Turkey. He created that group for advocation Python usage and answering the questions of Pythonistas.
I truly believe that he is going to be a key person in advancing the mission of the PSF and with no doubt nominate him to become a PSF fellow.

=== Matt Lebrun (elected Q2 2019) and Michaela Reyes (elected Q2 2019) ===
I, Michie Ang, propose that Matt Lebrun and Michaela Reyes be recognized as Fellows of the Python Software Foundation, due to their significant contributions to the Python community. These two individuals have shaped the Python community in the Philippines by setting up PyConPH (the community of Python Enthusiast in the Philippines). They have been doing so much work in the Philippines and I have seen individuals become Python devs and getting jobs as Python developers because of them. Also, become leaders in the Python community. It's been a long time that they have been serving the Python Community here and I hope their hard work be recognized.

They co-founded PythonPH. They hold meetups almost every month to talk about Python. They held PyCon all over the Philippines and this year they brought PyConAPAC. They also started DjangoGirls in Manila and many many more. I hope they would be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

=== Valentin Dombrovsky ===
For years I help Valentin Dombrovsky to run "Moscow Python" community.

He has endeavored in bringing the use of Python and related technologies into all spheres of Zimbabwean Society. Through his efforts, Zimbabwe has hosted 2 Pycon Events, a Django Indaba and is on track on hosting a the third edition of Pycon in Zimbabwe. He has encouraged the ordinary Zimbabwean to take up Python Coding as a skill. A special mention of this has to be made for his participation in setting up and running Django Girls Coaching Events. His selfless dedication goes above and beyond after you take into account he has to do this in a tough economic environment(Mind you the price I paid for Pycon 2018 is now worth less than half its value than what I paid for initially). He is keeping the Python Community alive and well in Zimbabwe. The only other similar community that exists is Wordpress, but it does not come close in comparison with what Humphrey & Team have achieved.

But lets not forget, he must be one of the few people who writes code exclusively using Vi in Zimbabwe. That deserves an award in itself.

=== Filip K≈Çƒôbczyk (elected 2017) ===
I, Richard  Kellner, propose that Filip K≈Çƒôbczyk ( fklebczyk@gmail.com ), be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. Filip made significant contributions to the Python community as a PyCon PL regional conference, a lead organizer for 2017, 2016 and 2015 as far as I can confirm. I have been visiting and volunteering at this conferences and they were organized in high standard.  As far as I could go into the history of the websites: https://pl.pycon.org/2010/organizatorzy.html in 2010 he was part of the organizational team. And as far as the talks go the first PyCon PL was in 2007 and Filip was there as well (I have no proof, this is just word of mouth). Filip is active in the community more than a decade and he does the volunteering work. Therefore I think Filip's work should be officially recognized! I have started to organize PyCon SK in 2015 and we had the first conference in 2016 and Filip was the supporting community member who went the extra mile and came to Bratislava to out very first meetup to support the community growth. We told him our ideas about PyCon  SK and he was willing to share his 8 years of experience with PyCon PL. Without him, we wouldn't be able to organize our first conference at such high level.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise DjangoCon Europe 2015  but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup (PyDiff) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded "Don't be afraid to commit" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier PyCon organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
