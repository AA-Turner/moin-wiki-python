=== Example Entry: Joe User ===
I, John Doe, propose that Joe User be recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community as a co-founder of the PyCon Foobar regional conference, a lead organizer for the 2011 and 2012 editions of the Marsian Python community's flagship Python conference, MarsPython and as a long-term contributor to international collaborative efforts amongst the Marsian Python community.

== 2017 Q4 Nominations ==

=== Cristoph Gohlke ===
I, Martin Gfeller, like to nominate Cristoph Gohlke (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) of Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine as PSF fellow. Christoph's repository of compiled Python packages (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) makes using Python on the Windows 64-bit much easier, and feasible for those without compiling skills. This contribution to the ecosystem shows technical excellence and dedication to keep all packages up to date. By making Python 3 version of packages available since quite some time, he also helped transition to Python 3 for Windows users. I believe his work is widely used, but not widely acclaimed, so in my opinion, he deserves recognition for this very valuable service. I had never a need to contact him, because the latest packages are always compiled and already there as soon as I have a need.

=== Manuel Kaufmann ===
I, Johanna Sanchez, propose Manuel Kaufmann to be recognized as Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python communities in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) with the project Argentina in Python (https://argentinaenpython.com).

Manuel Kaufmann has organized more than 50 events to promote and share knowledge about Python programming at different audience levels from beginner to advanced. Some of these events are registered in the "Past Events" section (https://argentinaenpython.com/eventos/#eventos-pasados).
Within these spaces it has taken into account the inclusion of women in technology, organizing more than 15 Django Girls workshops throughout all Latin America. Gallery with a lot of pictures from most of all his events: - https://argentinaenpython.com/galeria/
Blog post written by others about his latest participation in events:- http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/165656387217/this-blog-post-was-written-by-jorge-namour-thank, - http://pybaq.co/blog/como-fue-organizar-primer-django-girls-barranquilla/
He is currently supporting the organizers of PyCon Colombia 2018 as a collaborator and nexus with the PSF as sponsor. - https://www.pycon.co

== 2017 Q3 Nominations ==

=== Brian Ray ===
I, Don Sheu, propose that Brian Ray founder of Chicago Python user group is recognized as a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, due to his significant contributions to the Python community of organizing one of the oldest and largest user groups in the world for over 12 years. Chicago Python ("ChiPy") has fostered such important contributors to Python and computer science like Aaron Swartz the creator of RSS and founder of Reddit, Adrian Holovaty the creator of Django, Mike Cafarella creator of Hadoop, John Hunter creator of MatPlotLib, and Harper Reed the CTO for the Obama for America campaign and credited with winning the 2012 election. Brian has also contributed to and launched open source and free software projects.

In addition to his significant contributions as an author of high quality books on Python subjects, Dusty founded Puget Sound Programming Python ("PuPPy") in August 2014. In less than a year, PuPPy has attracted nearly 1000 members and holds monthly meetings that draw over 100. The most recent meeting in June hosted by Google drew attendance of over 170. Dusty booked speakers like Larry Hastings, Lukasz Langa, Jack Diederich, Carlos Guestrin, and several founders of successful Python-using Seattle startups.

=== Peter Inglesby ===
Peter has served the UK Python community through his extraordinary efforts to ensure the continuity of the PyCon UK conference. Under his tenure, the size of the conference has grown continuously as has the team of voluntary organisers.

His leadership has ensured the longevity of the event and the continued existence and improvement of a vital event in the life of the UK Python community.

- Nominated by Own Campbell May 2017

=== Daniele Procida ===
Daniele has served the Python community through his sustained contributions to PyCon and DjangoCon conferences around the world as an organiser, speaker, mentor and teacher.

As the conference director for PyCon UK, he has overseen continuous growth in participation and has used that experience to help other conferences in their efforts to bring Python to a wider audience. A notable example is his work over three years to organise, establish and nurture PyCon Namibia to the point where it is now self-sustaining.

Daniele is a member of the Django Software Foundation board and one of the leading members of the Python community in Cardiff. After organising the first Django conference in the UK in Cardiff in 2014 he not only went on to organise DjangoCon Europe 2015  but also is a founding member of the Cardiff Python user group meetup (PyDiff) which has grown to be an event regularly hosting 30 attendees.

His commitment to nurturing beginner programmers and inexperienced conference speakers has been exemplary and he is a vocal champion of diversity and the support of minority communities at Python events.

As a mentor and teacher, Daniele has helped many programmers make their first contribution to open source software through his well regarded "Don't be afraid to commit" tutorial.

Daniele has become one of the premier PyCon organisers on an international scale and, whenever he is the conference chair, the event is diverse, welcoming, well-organised and educational for all. Many are members of the Python community simply as a result of his commitment and effort.
