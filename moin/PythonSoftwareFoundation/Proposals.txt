This page provides a historical record of a proposal considered, but never pursued, by the 2014/15 Board to change the way the PSF approached high level strategic decision making.

The core proposal (which was not accepted) was the adoption of a particular approach to make strategic decisions:

 * [[PythonSoftwareFoundation/Proposals/StrategicDecisionMakingProcess]]

Secondary proposals contingent on acceptance of the above process were also put forward:

 * [[PythonSoftwareFoundation/Proposals/FellowshipRecognitionProgram]]
 * [[PythonSoftwareFoundation/Proposals/StrategicPriorities]]

The main concern with the proposal was that overseeing a more participatory decision making process would significantly increased the workload of both volunteer Board members and the PSF staff, without necessarily leading to improved outcomes when it came to the PSFs ability to pursue its overall mission.

Instead, additional focus was placed on the PSF's Working Group and project management processes, and in particular the delegation of funding authority from the Board level to designated Working Groups. See [[https://www.python.org/psf/committees/|this page]] for the list of currently active Working Groups.
