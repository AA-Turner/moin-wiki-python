============

I have been a member of the Foundation since 2003, and joined the Board a year later. As the
PSF's current chairman I have worked to simplify the Foundation's bylaws and improve the way
the Foundation fulfils its mission statement. I would like to continue this work and ensure
that the Foundation is equipped with policies and procedures that will enable it to better 
serve the whole Python community, and particularly the needs of the developers.
