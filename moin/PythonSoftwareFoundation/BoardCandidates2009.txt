Steve Holden
============

I have been a member of the Foundation since 2003, and joined the Board a year later. As the
PSF's current chairman I have worked to simplify the Foundation's bylaws and improve the way
the Foundation fulfils its mission statement. I would like to continue this work and ensure
that the Foundation is equipped with policies and procedures that will enable it to better 
serve the whole Python community, and particularly the needs of the developers.


Brett Cannon
============

I have been a member of the PSF since 2003 and a board member since 2006. I have been the chairman of the infrastructure committee for several years, during which we moved from SourceForge to our own hosting solution. I continue to try to empower the PSF to help make the development of Python easier for existing core developers as well as anyone else attempting to contribute to Python.


Raymond Hettinger
=================

I have been a member of the PSF since 2003 and a board member for one year. 
I'm an active developer of the Python core.  I want to continue to support
the PSF goals of promoting the language and safeguarding its IP rights.


James Tauber
============

I became a member of the PSF and of its board in 2008. I am chairman of the trademarks committee and have been involved with the PSF's involvement in the Google Summer of Code every year and as the admin in 2007 and 2008. I want to continue to protect Python's trademarks and promote Python's usage both commercially and in open source projects.
