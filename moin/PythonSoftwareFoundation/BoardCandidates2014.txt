Jessica McKellar
==================

*Current board member (2012, 2013)*

It has been an honor and pleasure to serve on the PSF Board for the past two years. I love this community, and I hope to have the opportunity to continue to serve it as a Board member as it grows into new challenges and opportunities next year.

I bring several perspectives to the Board, as:

* a user group organizer, for the `Boston Python user group <http://bostonpython.com>`_ -- the largest Python user group in the world.

* someone who regularly interacts with beginners, new community members, and first-time open source contributors, through various initiatives including the `OpenHatch project <http://openhatch.org>`_, `Google Summer of Code <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/03/get-ready-for-google-summer-of-code.html>`_, and as a `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`_ core developer.

* someone who regularly does programming outreach to underrepresented groups, through my work on the `Outreach and Education Committee <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/outreach-and-education>`_, `Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`_, and as head organizer for the `Boston Python Workshop <http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/>`_.

This past year, as part of my Foundation work I:

* served on the PSF `Outreach and Education Committee <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/outreach-and-education>`_, and in particular worked to promote the committee and help groups write and submit grant requests.

* regularly spoke and wrote about the PSF and encouraged community participation (e.g. Kiwi PyCon 2013 keynote, All Things Open, upcoming PyCon North America 2014 keynote, upcoming PyTennessee keynote, upcoming PyCon APAC 2014 keynote, PSF blog posts).

* regularly reached out to individuals and initiatives about partnering with the PSF or applying for grants / getting community support to run Python events.

* after informally playing this role in 2013, became the first ever  `Diversity Outreach Chair <https://us.pycon.org/2014/about/staff/>`_ for PyCon North America 2014. The conference has a record-setting percentage of proposals submitted by women, and will have a record 33% women speakers. There are of course many more axes to diversity and more to do next year!

The language and community continue to grow, which is great, but with this growth have come some growing pains for the Foundation. I think the most important goal for the PSF for 2014 is to finish several important but lagging initiatives, and to do so in a way that is transparent and with sustainable volunteer obligations. In particular, 2014 will be the year we finish:

* the `PSF Bylaws and membership structure changes <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-bylaws-wg>`_
* the `python.org redesign <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-redesign>`_
* the `Python Brochure <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PSF%20Python%20Brochure>`_

Additionally, I'd like to lead:

* more global community development, including support for user groups, conferences, and outreach initiatives, in particular outside the United States.
* proactively seeking out/creating and supporting opportunities for Python in education.

Affiliation: Jessica McKellar is a co-founder of Zulip.
