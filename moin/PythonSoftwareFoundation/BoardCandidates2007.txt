David Turvene
=============
The obvious questions are:

* "Who is this guy?"

  I have been a professional software developer for over twenty years
  using, whenever possible, Open Source tools. 

  In 2005 I began experimenting
  with a variety of dynamic languages and quickly fell on Python as the
  one with the most promise for large, long-lived systems. For the last
  year I have experimented with a number of python applications for XML
  and Web development, focusing on Zope/Plone most recently.

* "Why is he here?"

  The short answer is `David Goodger`_ extended an invitation, so here I
  am.

  But of course it isn't quite that simple. I feel Python is a great
  technology; very well thought-out with tremendous potential.  I am
  interested in contributing to the growth of it.  Furthermore I have a
  good amount of free time through 2007.  

  This begs a number of questions that do not seem to be appropriate for
  this space but I can be reached at mailto:dturvene@comcast.net.

* "What can he do for the PSF_?"

  As a software manager for many years, I came to learn that most of the
  work to support a company, even one that is tax-exempt and for the
  betterment of the universe, is *not* fun, challenging or even interesting.
  But it is critical. 

  I reviewed the `Director Duties`_ and am comfortable in whatever role
  assigned to me.  I see my main tasks in this role as:

  - Help out where needed and participate as an audience member in
    discussions.  I will try my best to perform whatever tasks are
    assigned to me.
  - Spread the influence of Python via advocacy and making it more
    visible to the software community at-large.

David Goodger
=============

I first learned Python in 1998 and immediately became an enthusiastic
Pythonista.  The Python community has become very important to me.
That's why I became a PEP editor and started helping out with the
web site.  I was elected as a member of the PSF in 2003, began
helping out with PyCon in 2004, then got involved with the Board of 
Directors, first as Assistant Secretary in 2005 and as a Director 
and Secretary in 2006.

I believe in the principles of the Free Software movement in
general, and Python and its community in particular.  Working with
the PSF as a Director is one way for me to give something back.

Contributions to the PSF & the Python community:

* Creator of `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`__ and
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`__

* PEP editor since 2002

* A maintainer of python.org, including the website conversion

* PyCon volunteer since 2004

* Director & Secretary since PyCon 2006, Assistant Secretary in 2005

  As Secretary (and Assistant Secretary before), I maintain the
  minutes of the Board and Members' meetings, and am in the process
  of organizing our paper records.  As a Director, I have taken on
  many tasks large and small, perhaps too many: I currently have the
  distinction of the most pending action items in the Board meeting
  minutes.

As a Director, these are some of the things I would like to
accomplish and see accomplished:

* Establishment of an annual budget and budget policy, and a
  strategy/action plan (e.g. a grants process)

* Organization of the PSF's records

* Simplification of the web site's toolchain

* Creation of effective advocacy materials

* Reduction of my PSF to-do list


Stephan Deibel
==============

A little about me:

* Co-founder of Wingware, maker of Wing IDE for Python
    http://wingware.com/
* Created Pythonology, one of the early Python Advocacy sites
    http://pythonology.org/
* Editor of the Python Success Stories collection
    http://pythonology.org/success
    http://python.org/about/success
* Member of the PSF
* Using Python since 1998

Some of my past contributions to the PSF:

* Chairman of the Board of the PSF since 2004
* Worked with legal counsel on the trademark policy
    http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/
* Drafted parts of the license FAQ
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq
* Supported funding of the website redesign, and participated in the work as a volunteer
    http://python.org/
* Supported paying nominal salaries for the critical work done by the Treasurer (Kurt Kaiser) and Secretary (David Goodger)
* Championed funding Jeff Rush in the current six-month trial period for the Python Advocacy Coordinator position position, which I now oversee together with Neal Norwitz
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator
* Respond to email questions re: trademarks and licensing

Things I would like to see:

* An easier-to-use web framework for python.org
* Continued support for advocacy, if this proves effective
* Revival of the grants process in some form
* Development of a more effective fund raising capability (more like a "normal" charity)

Notes:

I am also chairman of the Python Support Committee, which is
charged with fund raising, but haven't had much time for this so
there is little progress.

My company, Wingware, was previously a sponsor of the PSF, under
its legal name Archaeopteryx Software Inc, but converted to
Emeritus status when I started putting time into the PSF.

I live in Cambridge NY, a rural town in upstate NY where "pie ala
mode" was invented and life is good.


Brett Cannon
============

I was elected to the PSF membership during the first PyCon in 2003.  Shortly after that I become a committer on Python itself.  Over the years I have made various contributions to the Python community, the largest of which was writing the python-dev Summaries for over two and a half years.

At PyCon 2006 I joined the PSF board.  I was also elected chairman of the Infrastructure committee which is nearly completion on moving Python's issue tracking from SourceForge over to our own Roundup installation.


David Ascher
============

* director of the PSF since inception
* connector with other foundations (mozilla, apache, perl, etc.)
* co-author of Python books
* CTO/VP @ ActiveState (vendor of tools for Python programmers)
