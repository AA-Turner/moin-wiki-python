A little about me:

* Co-founder of Wingware, maker of Wing IDE for Python
    http://wingware.com/
* Created Pythonology, one of the early Python Advocacy sites
    http://pythonology.org/
* Editor of the Python Success Stories collection
    http://pythonology.org/success
    http://python.org/about/success
* Member of the PSF
* Using Python since 1998

Some of my past contributions to the PSF:

* Chairman of the Board of the PSF since 2004
* Worked with legal counsel on the trademark policy
    http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/
* Drafted parts of the license FAQ
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq
* Supported funding of the website redesign, and participated in the work as a volunteer
    http://python.org/
* Supported paying nominal salaries for the critical work done by the Treasurer (Kurt Kaiser) and Secretary (David Goodger)
* Championed funding Jeff Rush in the current six-month trial period for the Python Advocacy Coordinator position position, which I now oversee together with Neal Norwitz
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator
* Respond to email questions re: trademarks and licensing

Things I would like to see:

* An easier-to-use web framework for python.org
* Continued support for advocacy, if this proves effective
* Revival of the grants process in some form
* Development of a more effective fund raising capability (more like a "normal" charity)

Notes:

I am also chairman of the Python Support Committee, which is
charged with fund raising, but haven't had much time for this so
there is little progress.

My company, Wingware, was previously a sponsor of the PSF, under
its legal name Archaeopteryx Software Inc, but converted to
Emeritus status when I started putting time into the PSF.

I live in Cambridge NY, a rural town in upstate NY where "pie ala
mode" was invented and life is good.
