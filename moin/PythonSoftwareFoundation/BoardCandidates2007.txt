=============

I first learned Python in 1998 and immediately became an enthusiastic
Pythonista.  The Python community has become very important to me.
That's why I became a PEP editor and started helping out with the
web site.  Since I was elected as a member of the PSF in 2003, I
became involved with PyCon and with the board of directors, first as
Assistant Secretary and now as a Director and Secretary.

I believe in the principles of the Free Software movement in
general, and Python and its community in particular.  Working with
the PSF as a Director is one way for me to give something back.

Contributions to the PSF & the Python community:

* Creator of `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`__ and
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`__

* PEP editor since 2002

* A maintainer of python.org, including the website conversion

* PyCon volunteer since 2004

* Director & Secretary since PyCon 2006, Assistant Secretary in 2005

  As Secretary (and Assistant Secretary before), I maintain the
  minutes of the Board and Members' meetings, and am in the process
  of organizing our paper records.  As a Director, I have taken on
  many tasks large and small, perhaps too many: I currently have the
  distinction of the most pending action items in the Board meeting
  minutes.

As a Director, these are some of the things I would like to
accomplish and see accomplished:

* Establishment of an annual budget and budget policy, and a
  strategy/action plan (e.g. a grants process)

* Organization of the PSF's records

* Simplification of the web site's toolchain

* Creation of effective advocacy materials

* Reduction of my PSF to-do list


Stephan Deibel
==============

A little about me:

* Co-founder of Wingware, maker of Wing IDE for Python
    http://wingware.com/
* Created Pythonology, one of the early Python Advocacy sites
    http://pythonology.org/
* Editor of the Python Success Stories collection
    http://pythonology.org/success
    http://python.org/about/success
* Member of the PSF
* Using Python since 1998

Some of my past contributions to the PSF:

* Chairman of the Board of the PSF since 2004
* Worked with legal counsel on the trademark policy
    http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/
* Drafted parts of the license FAQ
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq
* Supported funding of the website redesign, and participated in the work as a volunteer
    http://python.org/
* Supported paying nominal salaries for the critical work done by the Treasurer (Kurt Kaiser) and Secretary (David Goodger)
* Championed funding Jeff Rush in the current six-month trial period for the Python Advocacy Coordinator position position, which I now oversee together with Neal Norwitz
    http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator
* Respond to email questions re: trademarks and licensing

Things I would like to see:

* An easier-to-use web framework for python.org
* Continued support for advocacy, if this proves effective
* Revival of the grants process in some form
* Development of a more effective fund raising capability (more like a "normal" charity)

Notes:

I am also chairman of the Python Support Committee, which is
charged with fund raising, but haven't had much time for this so
there is little progress.

My company, Wingware, was previously a sponsor of the PSF, under
its legal name Archaeopteryx Software Inc, but converted to
Emeritus status when I started putting time into the PSF.

I live in Cambridge NY, a rural town in upstate NY where "pie ala
mode" was invented and life is good.

I was elected to the PSF membership during the first PyCon in 2003.  Shortly after that I become a committer on Python itself.  Over the years I have made various contributions to the Python community, the largest of which was writing the python-dev Summaries for over two and a half years.

At PyCon 2006 I joined the PSF board.  I was also elected chairman of the Infrastructure committee which is nearly completion on moving Python's issue tracking from SourceForge over to our own Roundup installation.


David Ascher
============

* director of the PSF since inception
* connector with other foundations (mozilla, apache, perl, etc.)
* co-author of Python books
* CTO/VP @ ActiveState (vendor of tools for Python programmers)
