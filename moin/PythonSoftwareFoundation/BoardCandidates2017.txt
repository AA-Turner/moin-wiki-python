**Registering as a PSF Board candidate**

To register as a candidate for the Board elections, add your nomination to this page using the format listed at the end of the page. We'd like as many groups within the PSF membership as possible to have the option of electing candidates that can directly represent their interests in Board discussions, so if there's someone you'd particularly like to have represent you, you may want to consider getting in touch with them and (politely!) asking if they'd be interested in nominating themselves. 

Read through the `Letter from PSF Director of Operations - Expectations of Board Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/ExpectationsOfBoardDirectors>`__ & `Duties and Responsibilities of Directors <PythonSoftwareFoundation/DutiesAndResponsibilitiesOfDirectors>`__. Please note that the PSF bylaws require that Board candidates disclose significant organizational affiliations (for example, their employer).

.. note:: Please follow the instructions on the `<FrontPage>`__ to gain wiki edit access.

**Registering to vote on PSF ballots**

While PSF Membership is open to anyone that chooses to join, Basic Members are not entitled to vote on PSF ballots, including Board elections. In accordance with the bylaws, the following PSF Members are entitled to vote on PSF ballots:

* Managing Members
* Contributing Members
* Supporting Members (these were previously called "Associate Members")
* PSF Fellows

To register as a Managing or Contributing member, refer to `this post <http://pyfound.blogspot.com.au/2015/02/enroll-as-psf-voting-member.html>`__ on the PSF blog.

To register as a Supporting Member, please use the `PSF Associate Membership site <https://psfmember.org/>`__.

PSF Fellows must themselves be approved through a PSF ballot, and thus only existing Fellows will be entitled to vote on the upcoming ballot. This ballot will include bylaw updates for the newly established process for nominating Fellows. 

**Outgoing Directors**

The following members of the 2015/16 Board are stepping down and will not be registering as candidates for the 2017/18 Board:
