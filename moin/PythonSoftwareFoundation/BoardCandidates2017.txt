**Description**
------------------

It is with great pleasure that I outline my personal contributions to the Python community. Additionally I will provide an overview of the merits that I believe I could bring to the PSF as 2017 member of the Board of Directors.

**History as a Python Organizer**
------------------------------------

I began my tenure as a Python organizer when I founded the PyLadies Chicago chapter over two years ago, I’ve since continued to act as the lead organizer. At PyLadies Chicago we aim to have at least one event a month. With May 2017 as our 29th month in existence, we’ve had 50 events putting us right at about 1.5 events a month (or three events every two months :-) ).

PyLadies Chicago has been a rich and rewarding experience as the continued recruitment for women in technical communities, such as Python, is one of my top priorities. As a Latina and a woman I believe it is instrumental we continue to advance this cause but more importantly to continue to advance it on a global scale.

**2016/2017 PSF Community Contributions**
--------------------------------------------

* Attended 16 of 17 meetings (3 by proxy)
* Represented PSF and Spoke at Python Jamaica (November 2016)
* Co-delivered PSF Update at EuroPython 2016 with Naomi Ceder
* PSF Communications Co-Chair, Overseeing Blog
* Assisted in the hiring of 2 new PSF Bloggers
* Authored 2 PSF Blog Articles
* Interviewed about the PSF in several capacities, for example: ZimboPy April 2017 Interview, Podcast Interviews (e.g. Python.__init__)
* Spearheaded the start of the PyCon Organizers Manual

Of significance for me has been the active outreach I attempt to have, providing consul, answers, or general support as I can explaining what the PSF is. For example when I represented the PSF at Python Jamaica many of the conversations with attendees I had led to asks for what the PyCon Organizers Manual can help address. I am also working with PyLadies Mexico City chapter members to help with their Python Day in June 2017 where I aim to meet the community in their own language of choice, Spanish. Other regional communities I have been working with include Zimbabwe through ZimboPy’s Python mentoring program targeting young women and Cuba with their upcoming Latin America Scientific Python Conference in September 2017.

**Python Community Contributions**
------------------------------------
* Speak about Python in several capacities, see `my website <http://lorenamesa.com/>`_ under Speaking and Press contributions. Examples include: `Language Track - Python GOTO Conference Chicago May 2017 <https://gotochgo.com/2017/speakers/226/>`_ , 
 `Open SourceCraft Podcast <http://codepop.com/open-sourcecraft/episodes/lorena-mesa/>`_ .
* PyLadies PyCon Booth Volunteer (2016, 2017)
* Young Coders PyCon Teaching Assistant (2017)
* Python Day Mexico City Speaker June 2017 including a lightning talk on PSF in Spanish
* O'Reilly's published adaptation of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to Python', Technical Editor
* Django Girls Chicago, Lead Organizer (2015, 2017)

**2017/2018 Goals as a Board Member**
-------------------------------------

My goals for 2017/2018 as a board member can be largely defined through the lens of organizational building, continued and better informed outreach, and promoting diversity:

* **Promote diversity**: Something that hasn’t come to fruition this past year has been the first PyLadies Conference. I want to help spearhead this conference and see to it that it becomes a reality. Additionally I want to include new voices on the blogging team, notably targeting Pythonistas from outside the United States. Additionally I want to work with the PyLadies blog ensuring new content is added to it frequently and investigate the opportunities of highlighting PyLadies content in the PSF blog.

* **Develop organizing documentation for Python organizers**: This will primarily mean the continued work on the PyCon Organizers Manual. My goal is to have flushed out content with names represented in each regional chapter of organizers that are willing to work on the document and speak with others about their work. It may be beneficial to consider translation opportunities for this document as well so targeting individuals who can support that initiative will be important as well.

* **Oversee and contribute to onboarding/transition strategies for the PSF Board**: Former PSF Director Carol Willing began centralizing this documentation with additional support from other PSF members. As the 2016/2017 board had a large number of novices to the board, I recognize a need for continued work on these documents. Onboarding is important and I want to act as a lead in helping onboard new members and create more documentation and resources as needed.

* **Support the Code of Conduct Working Group**: The PSF has started to investigate the idea of a Code of Conduct working group. At this time there hasn’t been a well defined policy put into place. I am passionate about investigating what a Code of Conduct Working Group may mean for the PSF, both in defining what the role of the PSF should be in such issues, as well as building a working group that includes the relevant voices to make this working group successful.

**Summary**
----------------

In summary, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration for my 2017 PSF Board of Director nomination. Serving as a board member for 2016/2017 has been an honor and I hope to continue to serve on in this capacity for the next coming term. There is much work to be done, considerably in the areas of continued geographic outreach and building better transition policies for the PSF in the future. However it is my hope to prioritize these areas as a 2017 PSF Director.

Naomi Ceder
==============

*2016, 2015 Board Member*

After two years as a member of the board, I'd honored to be able to continue to serve on the board. Having been a member the Python community for over 15 years, it's a commitment I take very seriously, and my absolute priority is the success of the PSF mission and the well being of the global Python community.

**My Contributions to the PSF board in 2016**:

* Co-created **PSF Grants Working Group**, which now plays the main role in awarding event grants.(2015) Worked to expand representation and participation esp from Africa and South America.
* Started work on a **PSF translations Working Group**, aimed at getting PSF and community documents translated. Pilot project is translation to Portuguese.
* Original member of the **PSF Fellows workgroup**, which will be restarting the process of selecting PSF Fellows.
* Assisted with creating **PyCon Organizers Handbook project.**
* Supported the creation of **Python initiatives in Nigeria** by helping get access to a mailing list, and advice on organization and grant requests; and Cameroon by coordinating with projects applying for PSF support.
* Gave **keynotes** at Europython, Python Brasil, upcoming talks at PythonDay MX and PyCon CZ; coordinated and co-presented **PSF members' meetings** at Europython (with Lorena Mesa) and Python Brasil.
* **Moderator of several PSF mailing lists** - edu-sig, pythonedu-wg, pynigeria.
* **Attended all PSF board meetings** (1 by proxy), and as vice chair, I **chaired several meetings** when the chair was unavailable.

**My goals for 2017/2018** as a board member are similar to those of 2016-2017 (they're not done yet). In addition to supporting the PSF mission in any way that I can, I want to:

* **Foster Diversity** across a wide range of axes - race, nationality, ethnicity, disability, neurodiversity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, economic background, etc. One area I would like to improve is the accessibility of PSF and Python community materials with their translation into more languages.
* **Increase Voting Membership** - As the global Python community continues to grow, we need to involve communities from around the world in the workings of the PSF. I am also working to bring back the process of selecting PSF Fellows.
* **Develop New Leaders** - I believe that for an organization to be inclusive thought and effort must be put into opening all aspects to new people. I'm very interested in getting more people involved in working groups and committees as way for them gain leadership experience.
* **Support Education** - Support for education is more than funding workshops - I'd like to encourage initiatives to improve pedagogy, tools, and resources for the various groups teaching Python, and support our working group aimed at curricula and teaching resources.
* **Evolve PSF management** - As the community grows, the role of the PSF board needs to adapt. I will continue to support changes to give the PSF staff more ability to handle managerial and operational issues and for the board have more of an oversight role. We also need to continue to learn and apply non-profit organizational best practices.

**Background**:

* **Keynotes and talks on Python, Diversity, and Community** at Python Brasil, PythonDay MX, PyCon CZ, PyCon UK, PyCon PL, PyCon Ireland, ACE!Conf (Krakow, Poland), Write/Speak/Code 2016, EuroPython, PyCon US, PyLadies, and others.
* **Organizer** - PyCon: Sprints, Intro to Sprinting workshop, education summits at PyCon, poster session; PyCon UK: Education Track Presenter, organising committe, poster session, Code of Conduct response team, Trans*Code at PyCon UK coordinator.
* **Author of The Quick Python Book, 2nd ed.** (3rd ed in preparation).

**Affiliations**:

* Blick Art Holdings, Inc - Development Manager
* Trans\*Code - Co-Founder
* Chi Tech Diversity (chitechdiversity.com) - Founding Member
* Bloomberg, LLC - Distinguished Lecturer & Distinguished Visiting Engineer

My goals for the PSF
---------------------

Hi, I'm Eric, and I'm a co-founder of Read the Docs and Write the Docs. The Python community has grown over the past few years, and I believe the PSF should grow with it. My goal is to increase PSF's impact on the world and the Python community, mainly through my focus on these goals:

* **Increase Sustainability**: The fact that we don't have full-time paid staff working on PyPI is a travesty. I believe there is a way to make this happen, but it will be a battle, and will require making some compromises along the way. **If people wear a pager, they should be paid.** There are some perverse incentives with paying people to develop software, but paying people for operations and support should be obvious.
* **Increase Inclusion**: I'm in awe of the work that the Pyladies, Django Girls, and others do every day. We should do as much as possible to support them, along with telling their stories, and inspiring others to create similar efforts for other under represented groups. I think that we've done a reasonably good job bringing people into the community, but we still need to work on Inclusion to get them integrated once they're here. **What does the month after a Django Girls workshop look like for the attendees?**
* **Improve Documentation**: This one is probably obvious given my background, **but I believe that documentation is a fundamental part of inclusion, which is a fundamental part of diversity**. It's also the primary way that a majority of our users interact with the Python language. We should improve our documentation theme so that it works on mobile, we should improve the structure of our docs to include more guides and tutorials, not just examples. We should also translate our documentation (`PEP 545 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0545/>`_), so that people all around the world can learn Python without having to learn English. There's a lot of work to do here, but I hope to provide vision in this space.
* **Improve Communication**: What on earth does the PSF do? How much money does it spend each year? What outcomes does it have? I think that I can help people understand what the PSF does, and how it operates, in a more transparent fashion. I think that this is the first step towards raising awareness for it in the community, and allowing it to become more sustainable and support more community projects.
* **Increase Python 3 Adoption**: The time is now. Python 3 is ready -- let's make it happen. The latest projects that I've created are on Python 3, but much to my shame Read the Docs is still Python 2, and defaults projects to Python 2. I will personally move forward in this regard, and think the rest of the community should as well. It's time.

Experience
-----------

I've been working on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_,
an open source project,
and now almost sustainable open source business for the last 6 years.
Along the way,
we've also built a global community around documentation with `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`_.
Both of these projects have had global impact on the software industry:

* https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2016-stats/
* http://www.writethedocs.org/blog/write-the-docs-2016-year-in-review/

I believe I'm uniquely suited to this job:

* I have a background in building (and sometimes failing to build) open source communities with Read the Docs
* I have helped build a unique world-wide community around Software Documentation with Write the Docs
* I have helped run conferences in 4 difference countries, and attended Python conferences on 4 continents

I've also been fighting day in and day out to turn both of these organizations into sustainable businesses, without compromising their missions. I believe this experience is valuable for the PSF:

* The PSF is tasked with building and supporting the Python community. I have experience with this both in Open Source, as well as the software industry in general.
* The PSF primarily makes money from conferences (PyCon) and tries to support the community with these funds. Write the Docs is fundamentally the same concept, and I have experience with the benefits and downsides of this "business model".

My Commitment to the Python Community
-------------------------------------

I've attended every Pycon US since Chicago in 2009, and love the Python community. My goal with serving on the board is to give back, and help move it forward on a number of issues.

I've spoken at a lot of conferences, mostly around Python. You can see more info about it `on my website <http://ericholscher.com/speaking/>`_ -- you may have even met me at one of these events :)

Affiliations
------------

* Co-founder of Read the Docs, also my primary source of income.
* Co-founder of Write the Docs, a global community around software documentation.

Raphael Pierzina
================

*New Board Member.*

*Carol: I nominate Raphael Pierzina. I'm very impressed with Raphael's community outreach. He actively encourages people that are new to Python by being responsive on the projects he maintains, by helping at sprints, and by being active at conferences and user groups. As a maintainer, Raphael brings experience to the PSF Board about the importance of supporting maintainers of the PSF infrastructure and Python language. I am confident that Raphael would carry out the PSF mission and make an excellent director. Thank you.*


Hi, I'm Raphael!

I write software for my job and for fun - mostly in Python and Go. I specialize in Python development, automated testing, and RESTful web APIs. I have been a part of the Python community for a couple of years now and use Python on a daily basis for work and in my open source projects. I made friends with many fellow Pythonistas online and at community conferences like EuroPython, WriteTheDocs and local user groups in Scotland. I am very inspired by the Python community.

Who am I? I am a person who gives back. I `contribute time`_ to the following open source projects:

- Maintainer and core contributor of the `Cookiecutter`_ project
- Advocate and core contributor for the `pytest`_ testing framework
- Creator and maintainer of the `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template
- Writer at `pytest-tricks`_, a blog dedicated to teaching pytest

I also attended and spoke at several conferences and local user groups: EuroPython 2015, EuroPython 2016, Python Glasgow, and Python Edinburgh. This year, I'm going to speak at PyData Berlin and hopefully also EuroPython.

I talked about pytest on the `Test & Code Podcast`_ and on the `Weekly Python Chat`_, volunteered my expertise in Python testing during `Adopt pytest month`_, helped raise funds for the `pytest development sprint`_, and worked in my free time as technical reviewer for a book about Kivy–a Python framework for NUI development.

Goals as a PSF Board Member
---------------------------

Increase inclusion
------------------

I would be honored to represent the PSF as a Board Director and **promote diversity and openness** in the Python community. I want to work with the board on initiatives to help newcomers around the globe to begin their creative journey with code. Most importantly, I want to make sure everyone feels welcome in our community.

Often the barrier from writing a Python script to publishing a fully-fledged PyPI package can be intimidating–but it doesn't need to be. I would like to kick off or support existing efforts that address this problem. I hope to **encourage new developers to publish their first package on PyPI** and share their creations with the Python community.

I also want to **support the important work** of the brilliant minds behind Django Girls, PyLadies and other great projects that focus on **integrating people from underrepresented groups**.

Support maintainers
-------------------

I believe that we as an industry and community need to do better at **supporting maintainers of open source projects**. These projects provide critical infrastructure and tools used by organizations and individuals globally.

Despite being volunteer run, they are expected to fulfill unfair demands by well-funded companies, which can lead to mental health issues and ultimately put the projects at risk. This is not OK! It is important to **make our ecosystem sustainable so we can grow a larger community of new and more diverse members without burnout**.

I don't have a definite solution to the problem of sustainability in open source, but I want to work with the other board directors on initiatives to combat this issue. I believe it needs to be a **PSF effort to explore more possibilities around raising funding** for critical projects in the Python ecosystem.

Improve Documentation
---------------------

The Python language documentation at https://docs.python.org has a few problems. Although the majority of prominent speakers at Python conferences actively advocate for the adoption of Python 3, it is not very well reflected in the official docs.

The fact that beginners on the `Python subreddit`_ regularly ask if they should be learning Python 2 or Python 3 is alarming. It could be an indicator for that the official documentation is not very explicit about this.

As a director on the board, I would like to work with the other members to better **understand what is causing the confusion within our community**. By updating the documentation we can **better communicate to aspiring Pythonistas that Python 3 is now widely supported** and the recommended language version for newcomers to learn.

Represent the PSF
-----------------

The Python community continues to grow, but I feel there is a **lack of awareness about the PSF and its mission**. The PSF meeting with Naomi Ceder and Lorena Mesa at EuroPython last year was a great way to give updates directly from the PSF board. Also the stickers for PSF members were awesome!

I would like to draw on this and represent the PSF in Europe. My hope is to **get people at conferences in Europe and local user groups in Berlin interested in the workings of the PSF**. It would be great to have more people register as PSF members and involve them in votes like this one.

Philip James
================

*New Board Member.*

**Who am I?**

Hi there! You may have seen me at PyCon this past year, or in years previously, or at DjangoCon US or DjangoCon EU, or at PyBay or PyDX. This year at PyCon, I was the guy helping stuff swag bags, or with the BeeWare booth, or taking your tickets at the PyLadies auction, or helping at the front desk for sprints, or giving a talk with my friend Asheesh Laroia about uWSGI. 

I’ve spoken at two DjangoCons, and am on the organizing team for DjangoCon US. If you’ve received an email about your visa for DjangoCon, it probably came from me! It’s through my work at DjangoCon and PyCon that I’ve become involved in the BeeWare community; I have the pleasure of serving there as a Core Contributor. 

Additionally, I've served on the board of a number of non-tech volunteer organizations, mostly in executive and communications capacities. I have roughly seven years of experience serving on various non-profit and volunteer boards.

But the measure of who we should want to see on the board is only partially about what they have done, and more about what they want to do.

I want to continue to grow the Python community, especially with a focus on growing the number of jobs available for Python developers and growing the number of companies sponsoring Python events. I’d like us to be pushing for a world where every Python programmer has a job they love, no matter their skill level, and where the events we run continue to be well-funded and welcoming. **When we keep hearing through backchannels about people feeling harassed at PyCon, or when our friends in this community can't find jobs, that should make us want to get up and do something.**

I also care intensely about the strength of the Python ecosystem. We need to have the best tools available, and that means a focus on our packaging and package distribution. PyPI, pip, wheels; I’d like to see all of these become first-class tools, and for Python to become more of a model of involvement and tooling excellence. **When every PyCon features at least one talk about working around our packaging tools rather than with them, this should be a wake-up call to all of us.**

Mostly, I want to be a board member to give back to the community that has given me so much, and do my part to help push us all forward. No matter the result of the election, I’d love to have a conversation with any and all of you, and I’m always available at phildini@phildini.net.

**Things I Plan To Do:**
 * Regularly talk at hackathons and universities about why they should use Python
 * Continue volunteering at events, especially with a focus on outreach and diversity
 * Investigate putting stronger financial backing around our ecosystem tools

**Conferences I've Participated In:**
 * PyCon 2013 - Attendee, Program Committee
 * PyCon 2014 - Program Committee
 * PyCon 2015 - Attendee, Speaker
 * PyDX 2015 - Attendee, Speaker
 * PyTennessee 2016 - Attendee, Speaker
 * DjangoCon EU 2016 - Attendee, Speaker
 * PyCon 2016 - Attendee
 * DjangoCon US 2016 - Attendee, Speaker
 * PyDX 2016 - Attendee, Speaker

**Affiliations:**
 * DjangoCon US

 * Django

**Organizations Volunteered with:**

Van Lindberg
==============

*2016 Board Member*

**Summary**
------------------

I have served the PSF in one way or another for a little over ten years now. My goals have always been to give back to the community that has helped me so much by using my professional abilities on behalf of the PSF. Most concretely, I have been a driver - or sometimes *the* driver - for most of the changes associated with professionalizing the PSF, expanding its scope and capabilities, and making it more effective.

My goal if elected would be to help finish the transformation to a standard executive director-led organization with an advisory board, as opposed to the executive board that we have had. I think that this will help us provide greater service to the community, greater continuity, and to take on greater challenges in the future while still not burning out our volunteers.

Note: If elected, I expect that I will be appointed to an "Officer Director" position.

**Qualifications**
------------------------------------

- I am one of the most consistently active directors - not just attending, but actively contributing to the board
- I typically donate 100-200 hours a year of time to the PSF, a which a substantial amount is in a legal capacity
- I now the representative of the "institutional memory" party, keeping the knowledge of what decisions were made (and why they were made) over the past 10+ years (although I will never be as good a representative of the institutional memory party as Tim).
- I also bring to bear knowledge about corporate processes and law that help keep the PSF functioning correctly


**Goals for 2017+**
--------------------------------------------

- Continue with the professionalization of the PSF; finish transition to a professionally managed organization
- Continue trademark prosecution
- Update PSF policies and procedures
- Generate new "onboarding" tasks and documentation to make it easier for new members of the community to get started contributing

Chukwudi Nwachukwu
=========================

*New Board Member.*

**Introduction**:

* An active member of the **PSF Grants Working Group**.
* A byproduct of **Python initiatives in Nigeria** that **Naomi Ceder** helped to build. We are officially registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria and now known as **Python Software Community**
* The Chairperson of Python Software Community in Nigeria.
* One of the moderators of the Nigerian mailing lists, python-nigeria and pynigeria.
* One of the admin of PythonNigeria Slack channel.
* One of the Supervisors for the upcoming **Pycon Nigeria**.

With over a decade Python coding experience, I have been able to serve the local community in Nigeria, and once for DjangoGirls event in Ghana and in Kenya (still being worked upon). I am always open to help, using whatever means at my disposal. Often times, the love for the thriving community drives me to take on more responsibilities when no one is forthcoming.

**Things I have done**:

* Spoke at 2 conferences about Python, its uses and why anyone should be using it.
* Got an interview from a Nigerian newspaper where I have also talked about Python.
* Helped the PSF Grants Working Group to save some monies by helping people reason as to why events should be priced appropriately.
* Helping PyCon Nigeria get local sponsors by leveraging on the contacts that I know.
* Been to many DjangoGirls in Nigeria (either as a coach or a mentor) and PyLadies too.
* Mediated in issues that could have resulted in crises: twice for DjangoGirls.
* Helped **DjangoGirls Lagos for IDP** get local funding for buying laptops that were given out to the participants for free.

On the *humanitarian* aspect, I have been able to help 3 people secure fulltime employment while the 4 person is undergoing an interview. In the places where they work, Python is being pushed more and more.

**2017/2018 Goals as a Board Member**
--------------------------------------------
- Offer My Support: In any role or capacity that I might be assigned, I intend to work to make it a success. I intend to give an accounting at the end of the day.
- Onboard More Volunteers: I intend to reach out to other people in this part of the world to come on board and help spread the wonderful things that Python has been achieving.
- Attend Events, Conferences, etc: If there be need to go and spread the Python message, I intend to be at the forefront of such.
- Grants Financials: As for the PSF Grants Working Group, helping them make the best decisions before grants are given out will be a major role that I intend to take up.

Marlene Mhangami
=========================

*New Board Member (Nominated by Lorena Mesa, 2016-2017 PSF Board Member)*

*Lorena: Over the past year on the PSF Board of Directors, there were some projects that I was able to interact with more directly as the Communications Chair overseeing the PSF blog. I learned of Marlene and her work with ZimboPy, through Mike Place - a mentor in the program that has worked closely with Marlene and ZimboPy. A unique project given it's potential for geographic impact, Marlene has been working tirelessly to promote not only Python in Zimbabwe but also the representation of women within that community. Having spoken with other organizers in her area, those that have worked one-on-one with her, and her students I am confident that Marlene would be an asset to helping promote Python in Africa, but also promote underrepresented voices such as women within the African Python community too. Her drive and position within the Zimbabwe Python community would be vital in helping promote Python's continued growth in Africa and globally.*

*Marlene in her own words:*

Hi, my name is Marlene and I’m a member of the budding Python community in Zimbabwe. I’m also the co-founder of ZimboPy, an organization in Zimbabwe teaching young women Python programming. It would be an honor to serve on the PSF Board. Below is an outline of how I would like to contribute as a PSF Director if given the opportunity.  

**2017/2018 Goals as a Board Member**
--------------------------------------------
- Encourage and Support Diversity by growing the number of PyCons in Africa- the global Python community is growing rapidly and I have been excited to see groups that are underrepresented playing an active role in making this happen. I’m particularly passionate about the progress that we are seeing in Africa. To date only four African countries, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria have successfully held PyCons and with 50 other viable candidates I’m hoping to help make that number grow. Through my work with ZimboPy I’ve interacted with Pythonistas from Botswana. It would be fantastic to work with them towards launching the first PyCon Botswana! I also hope to reach out to the Python community in Nairobi, Kenya  which meets up regularly and even has Python Expo’s to show off the work they’ve created using Python. I’d like to support the Pythonistas in these groups by actively seeking out and sharing their stories. 
- Encourage and Support Diversity by supporting African Python and Django Girl workshops: Additionally, I’m looking forward to sharing advice with members wanting to host Django Girls workshops or Python related activities in economically disadvantaged areas, given my experience with this. For example as part of our ZimboPy mentorship week we had an online Q&A with international Pythonistas like Lorena Mesa (a member of the PSF Board of Directors) and Ashley McNamara (from Pivotal Labs.) Our girls got great advice from them on where to find support and resources for women in tech as well as tips on being the best candidate for potential jobs. I would like to introduce similar events to other African countries and believe they will help the international Python community feel more connected!
- Improving Documentation- I look forward to contributing to the PSF Translations Working Group to make documentation from the PSF and Python community readily available to non-English speaking Pythonistas.   I also look forward to working on the PyCon Organizers Manual, as well as trying to popularize its use amongst new organizers globally. 
- Outreach and education programs: I would like to help support programs that make learning programming accessible particularly outside of the USA. Resources like tutorials and easy to follow summaries for teachers should be accessible and have an option for use in spaces that do not have stable internet connections. Keeping our members from diverse backgrounds in mind should be a priority when making educational documentation. 
 
Background
------------------------------------

I am the co-Founder of ZimboPy an organic, on-the-ground effort by local Python developers in Harare. Our aim is to advance the cause of women in tech in Zimbabwe. We work in community centers, universities, high schools and tech hubs to make programming accessible to girls regardless of their socio-economic status or past experience with computers. 
ZimboPy also has a Mentorship Program that helps computer Science/ IT majors in Zimbabwe’s best universities use their skills to help their community. Mentors this year joined us either virtually or in person for a week long period and where from USA, Italy, Australia and Bulgaria. Students were able to work with experienced developers to start work on an open source project called ZimFarm, connecting small scale farmers to vendors. 

I recently gave a talk at PyCon Italy and also work closely with the PyCon Zimbabwe organizers, Django Girls Chinoyi and was selected to give a poster presentation at PyCon USA2017. 
I believe my experience working with underrepresented communities, connecting and organizing Python developers from various parts of the world, and my passion to see the Python community grow makes me a great candidate for the board.

Paola Katherine Pacheco
===========================

**New Board Member**


**Description**

Hi, I'm Paola Katherine, I'm Systems Analyst, today I work with Python because of the community that hosted me with Pyladies and with Python Brazil. I believe that without the knowledge and help of the community today I would not work with development.
Because I lived in Brazil for a long time I suffered some prejudice and without the support of the community I would have given up.
From the moment I started in the area I have always tried to help everyone who wants to learn, focusing on women to understand the prejudice they suffer but I always had the intention to help anyone who wants to learn, as is the conduct of the Python community.
With this I got involved with events, thus reaching more people.
I believe that today Latin America in general needs attention in education, it is in a process of transition, a new generation which is now knowing technology, that is learning English, that has interest but in many countries in many countries still suffers a patriarchal culture Which does not see the woman working and also a technological lag.

**History of contributions to the community:**
 * Organization of the first Django Girls Rio de Janeiro
 * Django Girls Python Brazil 2016 organization, Florianópolis, the largest in Brazil.
 * Participation in the Pyladies Brasil community
 * Participation in the Pyladies community Rio de Janeiro
 * Creation of Pyladies Mendoza
 * Creation of the Mendoza Python community
 * Organization of Django Girls Pycon Colombia, where I just organized remotely until I found a Colombian who could lead with that after the event a Python community was created in Cali, Colombia.
 * Volunteer at Pycon Colombia
 * Speaker at Pycon Argentina and Euro Python to talk about community and diversity.
 * Organization of the Django Girls Euro Python, event where I organized alone and remotely, going only in the day. It was an event where we had problems in previous years and we had the success of getting tickets for all participants.
 * Creation of a conference focused on students and aimed at the diffusion of open source. Rio DevDay was the largest conference in Rio de Janeiro, with 311 people, 18% women and 40% students / people who never had the opportunity to work with technology.
 * Creating videos teaching python for beginners, to contribute to those who do not have much knowledge of English. Also helping anyone who is starting out and trying to be a female inspiration to the girls who are just getting started.


**My goals for 2017/2018 as a board member:**:

**Promoting diversity:** I would like to boost the issue of diversity in Latin America, we still need to include issues such as women, race, color. Since I lived in Brazil, which was much more ahead of other Latin American countries, we had problems with regard to female inclusion, and today in Argentina I see that the problem is a little more serious, perhaps because of cultural issues. I raise the Pyladies flag which encourages a lot of girls and minorities to be included.
 
**Promote the increase of knowledge:** By having another language, Latin America
In relation to the rest of the world for many times ends up falling behind.
I would like to encourage conferences, dissemination of knowledge, leverage this curious audience, students, to anyone who wishes to have this knowledge that often can not, due to lack of access to information.

Kenneth Reitz
==============

New Board Member.

Hello, my name is Kenneth Reitz, and I'm a lover of Python. I'm mostly well known for being the author of the Requests library, Python-Guide.org, and many others. 

I have spent a large amount of my time over the past five–six years giving talks about Python at many of the major user groups in the US, as well as keynoting/speaking at large Python events around the world. Many of these talks were about the future sustainability of Python and other open source projects. 

Python is a core and integral part of my life, and it would be an honor to help steward the direction of the community by serving on the board. I have a plethora of free time, and I can't think of a better way to utilize it. 

Values:
-------

- Sustainability — open source is all about sustainability, and the PSF is in a great position to decisively empower projects and communities, while providing infrastructure for the entire Python community. The role that the PSF plays is a very multi-faceted one, and it has been eye-opening to travel to Python events all over the world and meet any subset of the massive number of people who have lives that are impacted by the PSF's decisions.

Kushal Das
===========

2016 Board Member

I am a CPython core developer, and also a fellow at PSF. I am also co-chairing the PSF grants committee, and worked as the communications officer on the 2016 board and wrote the regular board meeting minutes reports to the community.

Other than volunteering for PyCon US in various roles, I also help as the sprint coordinator. You may have seen me taking photos during the conference.

I chaired the PyCon Pune, it is a new regional PyCon started from 2017 with goals to create more upstream contributors. 

I am organizing an online summer training for 10 years where people from all over the world participate and learn about FOSS in general and then learn how to use Python to solve their daily life problems. This training goes on for almost 3 months over IRC. The goal of this training is to get more global developers, diversity is a key factor in that training.

(Updates) for goals from 2016-17:
-----------------------------------

* To help PSF to grow the community base outside USA: Started a completely new regional PyCon (PyCon Pune), and also helped to organize the Python track in FOSSASIA (in Singapore). Regular mentor in PyLadies Pune group, and helped local PyLadies team during PyCon India. I attended all the meetings of PSF board this year expect the one week before PyCon (which I misunderstood due to timezone).

* Working to make sure the outreach and education efforts reach far away places: Helping with the grants working group and providing the regional input as required was part of my regular activity. I am also one of the org admin for GSoC for PSF.

Goals for 2017-18:
-------------------

* Continuing working on building upstream community in the Python eco-space. I would prefer to help in the communication from the board and getting the rest the of the community more involved.

* Continue working with the rest of core developers to build mentoring the new contributors to the CPython and workflow/infrastructure itself. GSoC and Outreachy are two important parts to reach out to a bigger and diverse community and help people grow.

* Helping out in the regular activities of the PSF.
