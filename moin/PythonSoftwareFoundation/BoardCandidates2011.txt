Jesse Noller
============

 I (VanL) am nominating Jesse Noller to continue to sit on the board of directors. I have had
 the opportunity to work with Jesse very closely for a couple of years now, and he has put in
 extensive work to elevate the PSF and make it a better organization.

 Just three things that Jesse has accomplished in the last year show his dedication to Python
 and the PSF.

  *  Established the `Sprints Project`_ and funded several worthwhile projects. This is the PSF
     at its best - finding and serving Python-related projects to advance the language as a
     whole. Not only did this get code committed for the benefit of Python generally, Jesse
     also got the Python Sprints website launched (an endeavor in itself).

  *  Served as Program Committee Chair (PyCon 2010) and Co-Chair (PyCon 2011). This is a lot
     of work and is the PSF's biggest project from year to year. Jesse knows about how PyCon
     works from the inside out, having established himself as a real contributor over several
     years.

  *  Acted as a mini-BDFL for PEP 3148, shepherding the Futures module through the PEP process
     all the way to acceptance.

 In addition, Jesse continues to work as a core committer, blogs about Python, works at a
 Python Startup, and is always active defending and explaining Python on Reddit and Hacker
 News.
