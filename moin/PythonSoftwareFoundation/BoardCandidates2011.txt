Jesse Noller
============

*2010 Board Member.*

 I (VanL) am nominating Jesse Noller to continue to sit on the board of directors. I have had
 the opportunity to work with Jesse very closely for a couple of years now, and he has put in
 extensive work to elevate the PSF and make it a better organization.

 Just three things that Jesse has accomplished in the last year show his dedication to Python
 and the PSF.

  *  Established the `Sprints Project`_ and funded several worthwhile projects. This is the PSF
     at its best - finding and serving Python-related projects to advance the language as a
     whole. Not only did this get code committed for the benefit of Python generally, Jesse
     also got the Python Sprints website launched (an endeavor in itself).

  *  Served as Program Committee Chair (PyCon 2010) and Co-Chair (PyCon 2011). This is a lot
     of work and is the PSF's biggest project from year to year. Jesse knows about how PyCon
     works from the inside out, having established himself as a real contributor over several
     years.

  *  Acted as a mini-BDFL for PEP 3148, shepherding the Futures module through the PEP process
     all the way to acceptance.

 In addition, Jesse continues to work as a core committer, blogs about Python, works at a
 Python Startup, and is always active defending and explaining Python on Reddit and Hacker
 News.

==================

*2010 Board Member.*

I've been working with Python since 1993/4 and on Python since 1997 as core developer. Many of you may know my company eGenix.com and the mx* extensions (mxDateTime, mxTextTools, mxODBC, etc.). As Python core developer I designed the Unicode integration, the codecs subsystem, wrote the platform module and helped with lots of details that I found useful during my consulting work over the years.

From 2002-2004 I already served on the PSF board and was PSF vice president in 2003/2004. Back then I got the Public Support Committee (PSC) off the ground with the aim of finding ways to generate income for the PSF and initiated the work on getting Python contributor agreements in place.

Last year, Steve Holden asked me to candidate for the PSF board again and I accepted.

Here's my 2010 agenda, which is still valid:

    * organizing fund raising in a professional way
    * starting with some real PR work for Python
    * getting a web firm to give the python.org site a face-lift, make it more attractive for users (pupils, students, novices, developers, educational institutions, governments and businesses), donors and the press
    * giving the PSF a face at various important IT- conferences by sending delegates there to give talks, setup and run a booth, etc.
    * establishing the PSF as lobby organization in the political sphere in order to participate in projects where Python and its mindset can help, e.g. open-source, scientific and educational projects
    * establishing and running services for the community, such as those needed for running small- to medium-sized conferences or meetings
    * I hope to add a more a business-like mindset to the PSF board, in order to enable the PSF to mature both in terms of figures and responsibility.

During my year on the board, I carried on the work started by Steve to setup a budget for the PSF to work with. This was completed for 2010 with the help of Steve, Doug Napoleone and Kurt Kaiser. It made working with grants and spendings in general a lot easier for the board. We are currently working on setting up the budget plan for 2011.

The net effect of having such a budget was that we were able to give out many more grants than in previous years. See http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/ for details.

I also kicked off two new PSF projects: one to create a professional quality marketing brochure for Python which will help us get Python known outside the developer community and another one to make PyPI both more performant and reliable by pushing most of the content onto a content delivery network in an automated way.

Both projects are run by small teams and working steadily towards reaching their respective goals. Please see my monthly reports on them for details.

I'd like to continue with the work started in 2010 and look forward to another year serving on the board.
