Raymond Hettinger
=====================

Incumbent board member.  Director of Technology at SauceLabs.
Ten year contributor to the Python core.
Active participant at multiple Python conferences.


Jesse Noller
============

Jesse is a prominent member of the Python community. His accomplishments include:

  * Python committer and maintainer of the multiprocessing module
  * PSF member
  * Chairman of the PyCon 2010 program committee
  * Python blogger


David Mertz
===========

Incumbent board member.  Author of Python books and articles, including Addison Wesley's *Text Processing in Python*
and IBM developerWorks' column *Charming Python*.  Vice-chair of the PSF Trademarks Committee.


Jeff Rush
=========

Incumbent board member.  I've been a consultant since 1984 and first got involved with Python in 1997 by porting it to OS/2 (with patches into the Python core) and then for a number of years produced RPMs for Python that were picked up by Red Hat.  I've worked with Python, Zope and Twisted ever since.

I started the DFW Pythoneers usergroup in 2005, became a member of the PSF in 2006, and co-chaired PyCon in Dallas for 2006 and 2007.  I was hired by the PSF to be Python Advocacy Coordinator for two six-month terms in 2006/2007 and have produced a number of screencasts about Python at www.showmedo.com.  I also coordinated in 2007 the community response to the Forrester Research study on dynamic languages that rated Python highly.

I've presented about Python at the Vancouver Python Workship (2004), PyCon (2006-2009), Texas Regional Python Conference (2007), PyArkansas (2008) and Texas OpenSource Symposium (2008) and numerous DFW Unix and DFW Pythoneer usergroup meetings.


Tim Peters
==========

Your longest-standing Board member remains ever ready to mentor the young, or to chide them, depending on which medications he forgets to take from day to day.

2009 was a challenging year for the PSF, primarily for financial reasons. I'm pleased to say the Board responded appropriately without going overboard, continuing to make grants at a lower but sustainable level, while establishing new accounting and budget procedures. Exciting as watching rocks sleep? Yup, but essential - the glory of serving on the Board isn't for everyone ;-)


Allison Randal
==============

Steve Holden asked me to submit a nomination. I'm the lead developer of Pynie, an implementation of Python 3 on the Parrot VM, as well as architect of Parrot (yes, the VM is named after a Monty Python sketch, you see, it all started with this April Fool's joke...). I'm not a PSF member yet, but hope to join in the future. I'm currently studying at the University of Bristol in the UK, where I'm subversively working for student rights to do assignments in Python.

I have experience in open source foundations and communities. Together with Dave Neary of GNOME, in 2005 I founded a group called FLOSS Foundations to bring together leaders from a broad array of open source foundations. I'm chairman of the board of the Parrot Foundation. I was on the review committee for the GPLv3. I was president of the Perl Foundation at one point, and still serve on the board as a legal advisor, though I'm no longer actively involved in daily operations.

I might be best described as a fresh perspective and a voice of experience in the school of hard knocks. I'd be happy to serve the Python community in some useful way.


James Tauber
============

Incumbent board member. Have been doing Python for 12 years and open source for 17 years. CEO of Eldarion. Lead developer of Pinax and Django core developer. Chair of the PSF Trademarks Committee. GSoC PSF mentor 2005-2007 and PSF administrator 2007-2008. Frequent conference speaker.


Steve Holden
============

In my first interview with Guido van Rossum, when I asked him about the Foundation he said he felt it needed "adult supervision." That it should
look to me to provide such supervision is a true measure of the paucity of
talent this august body possesses.

This year I am trying to make sure that we have an interesting election, and
so rather than pushing a slate of nominated members I have been goading people with at least some Python involvement and good connections to open source and/or the software industry to lend us their experience.*

The Foundation now has a CPA office supervising its accounting, and continues to revise its bylaws to accommodate a changing interest in the language and its development. At this year's members meeting I shall be proposing further changes to

  a) Make it easier to terminate the membership of non-contributing members of any grade; and

  b) Introduce a new class of '''associate''' membership, which members will pay an annual fee and receive diverse benefits such as a quarterly magazine and concessions of different types from industry suppliers.

In the last year I have provisioned MSDN licences for a significant number of core developers, and hope to continue to expand this scheme so that Windows support remains for as long as it is a significant market requirement. The Foundation is grateful to Microsoft for the subscriptions, and solicits similar (nominated) member benefits from other industry vendors.

Any companies wishing to provide benefits to the new associate membershp category should please contact me, or the PSF Administrator Pat Campbell, patcam at python dot org.

I am trying to provide leadership by example. Since real life intrudes on my plans just as much as it does on yours I try to temper my expectations of volunteer results; the type of people I want to encourage are those who can take on a project and run it to completion with minimal supervision.

If this describes you then read http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/12/call-for-nominations-of-psf-directors.html and consider nominating yourself. You will be elected by the members, so don't expect an easy election if you don't have good open source credentials ...

* I am, however, planning to nominate one or two ...
