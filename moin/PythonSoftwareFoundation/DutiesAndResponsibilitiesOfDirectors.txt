============================================
 Duties & Responsibilities Of PSF Directors
============================================

In a nutshell, the Directors work to fulfill `the mission of the PSF
<http://www.python.org/psf/mission>`__; we take responsibility for
moving Python and the PSF forward.  The formal responsibilities of
Directors and Officers are listed in `the bylaws, articles V and VI
<http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws>`__.  Please see `the minutes of the
monthly Board of Directors meetings
<http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes>`__ for specific
actions and decisions taken.

The PSF's Directors and Officers conduct business via bi-weekly meetings
(one hour on IRC & Phone) and an active mailing list.  We discuss the work
being done and the work to be done, and Directors vote on resolutions.

The position of Director is unpaid, purely volunteer.  
Staff positions (Director of Operations, Treasurer, Secretary, IT Manager) 
do receive a salary.

There are two sides to a Director's responsibilities:

(1) Regular/administrative tasks to keep the PSF's legal standing
    healthy, keep the PSF operational and to respond to things
    like trademark issues or questions about the licensing of Python.

(2) Leading the PSF into a bright future, discussing the directions
    with your fellow board members and getting the members behind
    these new ideas.

We need people who can are willing and capable of implementing the PSF
visions.

A Director's physical location is not an overriding factor.  All of
our meetings are virtual; we meet on IRC.  We only meet
face-to-face once or twice per year, at PyCon and EuroPython, and even
then, it's rare for all the Directors to attend.  We currently have
Directors in the Australia, India, USA, Canada, and Germany.  
Having Directors in other parts of the world and other time zones may 
pose a logistical problem, but this will be worked around.

The time commitment is up to you -- what you want to work on, and how
much time do you want to spend on it.  Some activities are heavy,
others aren't; take your pick.  More info on expectations is available in the
`letter from  the PSF Director of Operations <PythonSoftwareFoundation/ExpectationsOfBoardDirectors>`__.
Attending the Board meetings is extremely important -- we need a 
majority of Directors in attendance in order to achieve quorum and pass 
any resolutions.

The PSF-Board mailing list typically sees about about 5 active
email threads per day. It can increase right before a BoD meeting.
