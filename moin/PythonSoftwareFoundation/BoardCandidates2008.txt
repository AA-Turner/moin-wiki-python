David Goodger
=============

I have been an enthusiastic Pythonista since 1998, and the Python
community is very important to me.  I was elected as a member of the
PSF in 2003.  Working with the PSF as a Director is one way for me to
contribute to the Free Software movement in general, and to Python and
its community in particular.

My contributions to the PSF & the Python community:

* Creator of `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`__ and
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`__

* PEP editor since 2002

* Python.org maintainer

* PyCon volunteer since 2004

* PyCon 2008 Chair

* PSF Secretary since PyCon 2006, Assistant Secretary in 2005

  As Secretary (and Assistant Secretary before), I maintain the
  minutes of the Board and Members' meetings, and am in the process of
  organizing our paper records.

* PSF Director since PyCon 2006

  As a Director, I continue to propose and take on many tasks.  In
  addition to the regular administrative tasks I work on, ongoing
  tasks include:

  - Working on some logos for the PSF

  - Establishment of an annual budget, a budget policy, and a
    strategy/action plan (e.g. a grants process)

Brett Cannon
============

I am running for re-election for the board of the PSF (currently finishing my second term on the board). At the moment I am the executive vice president of the board and the chairman of the Infrastructure committee.

During this past term in office my great accomplishment has been completing the transition of Python's issue tracker from SourceForge to our own infrastructure (having spearheaded the project when I first joined the board).

A rough timeline of my involvement with the Python community:

* 2002: Active member of python-dev.
* 2003: Gain commit privileges for Python, join the PSF.
* 2006: Join the PSF board.
