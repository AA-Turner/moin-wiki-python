David Goodger
=============

I have been an enthusiastic Pythonista since 1998, and the Python
community is very important to me.  I was elected as a member of the
PSF in 2003.  Working with the PSF as a Director is one way for me to
contribute to the Free Software movement in general, and to Python and
its community in particular.

My contributions to the PSF & the Python community:

* Creator of `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`__ and
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`__

* PEP editor since 2002

* Python.org maintainer

* PyCon volunteer since 2004

* PyCon 2008 Chair

* PSF Secretary since PyCon 2006, Assistant Secretary in 2005

  As Secretary (and Assistant Secretary before), I maintain the
  minutes of the Board and Members' meetings, and am in the process of
  organizing our paper records.

* PSF Director since PyCon 2006

  As a Director, I continue to propose and take on many tasks.  In
  addition to the regular administrative tasks I work on, ongoing
  tasks include:

  - Working on some logos for the PSF

  - Establishment of an annual budget, a budget policy, and a
    strategy/action plan (e.g. a grants process)

Brett Cannon
============

I am running for re-election for the board of the PSF (currently finishing my second term on the board). At the moment I am the executive vice president of the board and the chairman of the Infrastructure committee.

During this past term in office my great accomplishment has been completing the transition of Python's issue tracker from SourceForge to our own infrastructure (having spearheaded the project when I first joined the board).

A rough timeline of my involvement with the Python community:

* 2002: Active member of python-dev.
* 2003: Gain commit privileges for Python, join the PSF.
* 2006: Join the PSF board.

Stephan Deibel
==============

I'm the current chairman of the board of the PSF (since 2004) and will be running again as a director.  I'm also co-founder of Wingware, maker a commercial IDE for Python, and have been involved with various advocacy related efforts such as the somewhat dated `pythonology.org website <http://pythonology.org>`_ and the `Python Success Stories collection <http://pythonology.org/success>`_ (which are `also on python.org <http://python.org/about/success>`_).  I've been using Python since 1998.

In my past work for the PSF, I've concentrated on trademarks and licensing.  I worked with legal counsel on the `trademark policy <http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/>`_, drafted parts of the `license FAQ <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq>`_, and respond to questions on trademarks and licensing that are emailed to the board mailing list.

I've also supported funding of the website redesign (where I also participated as a volunteer), paying nominal salaries for the critical work done by the Treasurer (Kurt Kaiser) and Secretary (David Goodger), funding Jeff Rush in the `Python Advocacy Coordinator <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyCoordinator>`_ position, and donating to Python conferences around the world.

Recently, I wrote up an article on the PSF that was just published in volume 2 issue 4 of `The Python Papers <http://pythonpapers.org/>`_.

I should note that even if I am reelected to the board, I think it's good time for someone else to take on the role of chairman.  While I've done OK with it, there's room for someone with more time, energy, and vision to take the PSF farther than I have been able to.

Tim Peters
==========

I'm running for the PSF Board again as the oldest surviving member of the Institutional Memory Party ;-)  Due to family illness, I was mostly inactive in the Python community during 2007, but I at least attended the Board meetings, and like to think I prevented the youngsters on the Board from absconding with all the funds.

I should have more time for Python in 2008, and would like to contribute more of it to PSF work.  While it's true that "a vote for Uncle Timmy is a vote for the status quo!", I don't think that's entirely a bad thing.  The PSF is financially healthy and, as far as I can tell, has done no harm ;-)
