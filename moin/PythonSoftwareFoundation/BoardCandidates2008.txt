David Goodger
=============

I have been an enthusiastic Pythonista since 1998, and the Python
community is very important to me.  I was elected as a member of the
PSF in 2003.  Working with the PSF as a Director is one way for me to
contribute to the Free Software movement in general, and to Python and
its community in particular.

My contributions to the PSF & the Python community:

* Creator of `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`__ and
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`__

* PEP editor since 2002

* Python.org maintainer

* PyCon volunteer since 2004

* PyCon 2008 Chair

* PSF Secretary since PyCon 2006, Assistant Secretary in 2005

  As Secretary (and Assistant Secretary before), I maintain the
  minutes of the Board and Members' meetings, and am in the process of
  organizing our paper records.

* PSF Director since PyCon 2006

  As a Director, I continue to propose and take on many tasks.  In
  addition to the regular administrative tasks I work on, ongoing
  tasks include:

  - Working on some logos for the PSF

  - Establishment of an annual budget, a budget policy, and a
    strategy/action plan (e.g. a grants process)
