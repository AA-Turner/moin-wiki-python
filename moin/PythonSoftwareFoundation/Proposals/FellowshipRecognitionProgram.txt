'''Proposal editor:''' Nick Coghlan

'''Proposal status:''' Superseded

This proposal was superseded by a proposal to formally amend the bylaws to permit Fellow nominations by any PSF Member, and to delegate the task of reviewing nominations to a chartered Working Group rather than requiring a ballot of all voting Members: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/psf-community/2016-November/000398.html

That resolution was passed as part of the 2017 PSF Board elections, and more information on the PSF Fellow working group can be found here: https://wiki.python.org/psf/FellowWG

All PSF Members are now able to submit new PSF Fellow nominations, as described in https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/

The current list of fellows can be seen at https://www.python.org/psf/members/#fellows, while previously submitted nominations can be seen at https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/FellowNominations
