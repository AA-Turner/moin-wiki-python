Gear needed
-----------

 * Projectors: At least one per scheduled talk track; ideally, Open Space rooms should have projectors, too

    CatherineDevlin can borrow one from work.  Can anybody else?

    Don't sweat it too much until we know the locale, since it may provide them.

    William McVey should be able to provide at least one, possibly two projectors.

 * Microphones, amplifiers, etc.

    Steve Johnson can bring at least one, possibly two (three?) amplifiers depending on transportation, but one or fewer mics.

 * Big board for Open Space scheduling

    Steve Johnson has a 3x4' white board if that is what's required.
