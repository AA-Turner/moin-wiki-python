= Working with Time =

This page gives the basics of working with time in Python. More detail can be found in [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html the time Module Documentation.]

== Formats ==

There are several ways to work with time:

|| '''format''' || '''Python''' ||
|| seconds since the "Epoch" || {{{time.time()}}} ||
|| tuple || {{{time.gmtime()}}} ||
|| string || {{{time.ctime()}}} ||

'''The Epoch''' is January 1st, 1970, midnight, on UNIX systems. On other systems, look at the results of {{{time.gmtime(0)}}} to discover the date of the Epoch.

Measuring time in seconds since the Epoch is convenient for storage and comparing dates, because you only have a single number to consider.

The '''tuple''' contains several values, arranged the following way: year, month 1-12, day 1-31, hour 0-23, minutes 0-59, seconds 0-61, day 0-6 (Mon-Sun), day 1-366, and DST -1,0,+1. "DST" means "daylight savings time." For more information, see [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html time Module Documentation.]

Using a tuple is convenient, because you can access particular numbers by index, and because you can easily compare dates. Remember that Python compares tuple data from front to back. The data is indexed so that comparing tuple times is intuitive.

The '''string''' format reads something like "Mon Feb 16 16:04:25 2004". You can't really compare these usefully, but they're what you need to display things to the user.

== mock ISO 8601 ==

You can construct ISO 8601 with the following:
{{{
#!python
iso_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S", tuple_time)
}}}

You can revert the construction with the following:
{{{
#!python
tuple_time = time.strptime("2004-06-03T00:44:35", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
}}}

The problem with this, though, is that if the string isn't formatted ''exactly like that,'' it won't be read. For instance, {{{20040603T00:44:35}}} is valid ISO8601, as is {{{20040603}}} for that matter, but neither will be read by the code above.

To account for both common inputs, you could use:
{{{
#!python
tuple_time = time.strptime(iso_time.replace("-", ""), "%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%S")
}}}

I seem to require receiving both while working with XmlRpc produced by a mix of both Python and Perl code. The XmlRpc specification is not very particular about the ISO8601 variant used for it's Date``Time.

Note that this method does not handle time zones, so trying to parse `2004-06-03T12:34:56-0700` or `2004-06-03T12:34:56Z` will fail.  This is a fundamental limitation of `time.strptime` for which there is no easy workaround.

== Parsing ISO 8601 with xml.utils.iso8601 ==

If you have {{{xml.utils.iso8601}}}, you can do the following:

{{{
#!python
import xml.utils.iso8601
import time

# Present time, in ISO8601
print xml.utils.iso8601.tostring(time.time()) # returns "2004-04-10T04:44:08.19Z"
# From ISO8601 string, to seconds since epoch UTC
print xml.utils.iso8601.parse("2004-04-09T21:39:00-08:00") # -8:00 for Seattle, WA
# The epoch, in ISO8601
print xml.utils.iso8601.ctime(0) # returns "1969-12-31T16:00-08:00"
}}}

The module isn't perfect; If you omit the dashes, (perfectly valid ISO8601,) you'll get a {{{ValueError}}} exception.  However, unlike `time.strptime`, `xml.utils.iso8601.parse` will handle the timezone specification correctly.

xml.utils is distributed in ''python-xml'' in debian and ubuntu, but appears to be unmaintained.

== Parsing ISO 8601 with pyiso8601 ==

http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/iso8601/ provides a standalone ISO8601 parser.

== Parsing ISO 8601 with python-dateutil ==

Although this isn't advertised as ISO8601 support, [http://labix.org/python-dateutil python-dateutil] seems to deal with the format correctly (for example, it has time zone support).

{{{
import dateutil.parser
dateutil.parser.parse('2008-08-09T18:39:22Z')
}}}

== ISO8601 and Python in general ==

All in all, ''reading'' ISO8601 time values is non-trivial. For example, it is possible that someone can specify a full day, or a full week even, in ISO format. You can also specify days by number, if I recall correctly.

Generally, programs conceed to accept only a limited subset of ISO8601. That subset tends to be "{{{yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss}}}" and then either ".mmmmmm" sub-seconds or "+hh:00"/"-hh:00" for time zone.
