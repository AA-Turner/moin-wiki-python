= EuroPython2006/PYxIDEsSprint =

If there's enough interest, perhaps EuroPython might be a good venue for collaborating on PYxIDEs work. Things like...

 * Source code analysis tools. This might help in a number of IDE-related areas: completion, documentation, refactoring.
 * Work on things which support source code analysis:
   * AST node annotation: see where [http://www.python.org/pypi/analysis analysis] and [http://www.python.org/pypi/astng astng] can cooperate.
   * Type propagation: see where [http://www.python.org/pypi/analysis analysis] and [http://tony.lownds.com/home/index.php?topic=types t_types] can cooperate.

Add your suggestions to the list above!
