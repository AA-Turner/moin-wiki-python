The PyPy project will hold an open sprint at CERN after Europython. While you should have good proficiency in programming Python, no experience with the PyPy source tree is necessary. There are plenty of tasks which involve porting library module to Python and making sure that various tests pass. However, if you want to participate in the more advanced aspects of PyPy, you should spend some time on downloading and understanding the documentation and source code.
