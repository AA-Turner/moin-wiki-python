I'd hope to knock over most of the items currently in CheeseShopDev and would welcome others to participate in doing so. In particular:

 * bring interface in line with new pydotorg style
 * edit PEP 243 to reflect reality
 * documented procedures for "taking over" entries should the original owner of the entry go away (and any required system support)
 * tooltips for field labels
 * moderated user reviews and ratings
 * "what's related" using classifiers and possibly user-supplied information
 * expose documentation for XML-RPC interface
 * fix ...cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/python-wifi/0.3

I'm there, though I might be hijacking the sprint a little bit for other pydotorg purposes. Anyone else? -- JohannesGijsbers

We're working... and yes, we're hijacking it for pydotorg purposes a little bit as well. Two introductory links:
