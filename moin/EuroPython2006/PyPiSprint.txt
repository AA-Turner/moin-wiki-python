I'd hope to knock over most of the items currently in CheeseShopDev and would welcome others to participate in doing so. In particular:

 * bring interface in line with new pydotorg style
 * edit PEP 243 to reflect reality
 * documented procedures for "taking over" entries should the original owner of the entry go away (and any required system support)
 * better searching (eg. single search box on the front page)
 * tooltips for field labels
 * moderated user reviews and ratings
 * "what's related" using classifiers and possibly user-supplied information
