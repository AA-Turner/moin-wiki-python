Here is a list of known Python-based Wiki:WikiEngines.

	* MoinMoin -- A PythonLanguage SourceForge project, based on Wiki:PikiPiki
        * [http://jot.andstuff.org/ Jot]
	* Wiki:PikiePikie -- Python-based, lets you put a Wiki:WebLog on any page (based on Wiki:PikiPiki)
	* Wiki:ZwiKi -- Wiki:ZoPe-based, powerful, GPL.
	* Wiki:CMFWiki -- a ZwiKi variant; old but compatible with Zope's CMF (Content Management Framework).
	* Wiki:CyberPublishing -- a wiki-based web publishing framework written in Python; GPL
	* Wiki:PyWiki -- Python-based, uses RCS, GPL license
	* Wiki:PikiPiki -- Python-based, will run completely standalone
	* Wiki:PyleWiki -- Python-based, optional CVS backend, Unix-like rwxrwxrwx permissions on pages
	* Wiki:WikiForNow -- a Wiki:ZwiKi variant; used at zope.org
	* Wiki:WikiNehesa -- Many features, including images, headerbars, TEXT centering, image inventory/previewer, image uploader. Modular. $FREE$. GNU GPL.
	* Wiki:WyPy -- a Wiki:ShortestWikiContest contender, 23 lines

See the [http://colorstudy.com/docs/shootout.html Web Framework shootout] where different Python WebProgramming frameworks are used to implement a bare bones wiki.

== Elements for building a full-featured wiki engine: ==
 * ''Page templating system like [http://smarty.php.net/ Smarty].''  Possible options include [http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/empy/ EmPy], Cheetah, ModPython's PSP, or others listed in the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/WebProgramming#head-9d0636d6da8e88f8f09de1454c5961b44183b04d templating section] of the WebProgramming page.  Which one would you recommend?
 * ''Cache HTML versions of pages for faster loading.''  Ideally the page templating tool would handle caching.  PSP for ModPython can handle this, as well as Cheetah.
 * ''User Authentication.''  A user authentication system perhaps integrated with MySQL or possibly even LDAP.  Allow for different user groups and permission levels.  Any recommendations?
 * ''Database Integration.''  Can store data in mysql, postgresql, etc. or work without a database.  There is now an [http://php.weblogs.com/adodb_python ADODB module for Python] that might be helpful in this respect.  See also SqlObject.
 * ''Easy Install.''  Works completely in Python, and installs in one folder location.  Doesn't necessarily require a database or mod_python.  Doesn't require root privileges for install.  ["KarriGell"] is a web-application server that can run in standalone or with Apache and ModPython.
 * ''Small but Scalable.'' Doesn't require a huge server to run.

=== Arguments that MoinMoin is a candidate ===

  * in a really dynamic context like wiki, you can't simply cache the HTML. 
   * There are parts of the page that definitely can be cached.  And most wiki pages do not use any dynamic macros.
  * Moin has user / password auth in CVS. Groups and page ACLs also.
  * Database integration is more of an anti-feature, see the next 2 points.
   * The best tool would have ''flexibility.''  Be able to run standalone with an easy install, or integrated with Apache and a fast database server.  In PHP, this is incredibily simple if you use ADODB or PEAR.

Comment: "Support HTML tags" is more of an anti-feature in wiki. (so is table markup :)
