= List =

Here is a list of known Python-based Wiki:WikiEngines.

 * MoinMoin -- A PythonLanguage SourceForge project, based on Wiki:PikiPiki - runs as cgi, but also as FastCgi or with ModPython, lots of Plugins
 * InterFlow - runs with ModPython
 * Wiki:PikiePikie -- Python-based, lets you put a Wiki:WebLog on any page (based on Wiki:PikiPiki)
 * Wiki:ZwiKi -- based in Wiki:ZoPe, powerful, GPL.
 * [http://mdev.sourceforge.net/jesse/sliki/ Sliki] - runs with ModPython
 * [http://frotz.net/sakana/space/mojibake mojibake] - based on [http://frotz.net/sakana/space/home Sakana], runs with ModPython
 * Wiki:CMFWiki -- a ZwiKi variant; old but compatible with Zope's CMF (Content Management Framework).
 * Wiki:CyberPublishing -- a wiki-based web publishing framework written in Python; GPL
 * Wiki:PyWiki -- Python-based, uses RCS, GPL license
 * Wiki:PikiPiki -- Python-based, will run completely standalone
 * Wiki:PyleWiki -- Python-based, optional CVS backend, Unix-like rwxrwxrwx permissions on pages
 * Wiki:WikiForNow -- a Wiki:ZwiKi variant; used at zope.org
 * Wiki:WikiNehesa -- Many features, including images, headerbars, TEXT centering, image inventory/previewer, image uploader. Modular. $FREE$. GNU GPL.
 * Wiki:WyPy -- a Wiki:ShortestWikiContest contender, 23 lines
 * [http://wiki.webwareforpython.org/thiswiki Not-Yet-Named Wiki] - runs on Webware.  Supports static publishing, WYSIWYG editing, ReStructuredText.  Still in rapid initial development phase (as of Apr 2004).

= Comments, Ratings, Reviews, Wishlists =

See the [http://colorstudy.com/docs/shootout.html Web Framework shootout] where different Python WebProgramming frameworks are used to implement a bare bones wiki.

== Elements for building a full-featured wiki engine: ==

 * '''Page templating system like [http://smarty.php.net/ Smarty].'''  Possible options include EmPy, ["Cheetah"], ModPython's PSP, or others listed in the [http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/WebProgramming#head-9d0636d6da8e88f8f09de1454c5961b44183b04d templating section] of the WebProgramming page.  Which one would you recommend?

 * '''Cache HTML versions of pages for faster loading.'''  Ideally the page templating tool would handle caching.  PSP for ModPython can handle this, as well as ["Cheetah"].

 * '''User Authentication.'''  A user authentication system perhaps integrated with MySQL or possibly even LDAP.  Allow for different user groups and permission levels.  Any recommendations?

 * '''Database Integration.'''  Can store data in mysql, postgresql, etc. or work without a database.  There is now an [http://php.weblogs.com/adodb_python ADODB module for Python] that might be helpful in this respect.  See also SqlObject.

 * '''Easy Install.'''  Works completely in Python, and installs in one folder location.  Doesn't necessarily require a database or ModPython.  Doesn't require root privileges for install.  ["Karrigell"] is a web-application server that can run standalone or with Apache and ModPython.

 * '''Small but Scalable.''' Doesn't require a huge server to run.

=== Arguments that MoinMoin is a candidate ===

 * Moin has user/password auth, Groups and page ACLs also.

== Other Comments ==

"Support HTML tags" is more of an anti-feature in wiki; so is table markup :)

Database integration is more of an anti-feature.

The best tool would have ''flexibility.''  Be able to run standalone with an easy install, or integrated with Apache and a fast database server.  In PHP, this is incredibily simple if you use ADODB or PEAR.
