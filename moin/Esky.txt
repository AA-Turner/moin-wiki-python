PyPi entry: [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/esky/0.9.0|keep frozen apps fresh]]

Esky is an auto-update framework for frozen Python applications.  It provides
a simple API through which apps can find, fetch and install updates, and a
bootstrapping mechanism that keeps the app safe in the face of failed or
partial updates.

Esky is currently capable of freezing apps with py2exe, py2app, cxfreeze and
bbfreeze.
