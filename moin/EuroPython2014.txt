'''Note:''' If you have a EuroPython badge with a "VBB" logo on it, this serves as ticket for the zones A and B, valid from Monday, July 21 - Sunday, July 27. If you arrive early or stay longer, you may want to get day tickets. See the [[https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/venue/public-transportation/|EuroPython 2014 Public Transportation]] page for details.

=== Getting from Berlin Tegel (TXL) airport to Berlin Alexanderplatz ===
There's a bus called ''JetExpressBus TXL'' providing a quick link between the airport and the city center:

 * [[http://www.bvg.de/index.php/en/17131/name/JetExpressBus+TXL.html|JetExpressBus TXL]]

It needs between 30-40 minutes from the airport to the city center.

Regular Berlin public transport tickets such as the Berlin Welcome Card can be used to travel on this bus.

You will need a ticket valid for zones A and B (usually called "AB").

'''Note:''' If you have received your EuroPython badge by postal mail, you can use this as public transport ticket for traveling from the airport to the city center. The badge is valid for the zones A and B, from Monday, July 21 - Sunday, July 27. If you arrive early or stay longer, you will have to get day or single tickets. See the [[https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/venue/public-transportation/|EuroPython 2014 Public Transportation]] page for details.

=== Getting from Berlin Schönefeld (SFX) airport to Berlin Alexanderplatz ===

The airport Berlin Schönefeld has a train station which allows direct travel to Berlin Alexanderplatz. The train service is called Airport Express, uses the regional trains RE7 and RB14 and is available between 4:30 and 23:00 hours:

 * [[http://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/1872375-2932875-airport-berlin-schoenefeld-sxf.en.html|Airport Express]]

The journey takes around 30 minutes. There's a shuttle bus that operates between the airport and the train station.

'''Note that Berlin Schönefeld is in public transport zone C, not zones A and B.'''

If you have received your EuroPython badge by postal mail, you can use this as public transport ticket for part of the journey from the airport to the city center. The badge is valid for the zones A and B, from Monday, July 21 - Sunday, July 27. If you arrive early or stay longer, you will have to get day or single tickets. '''Important:''' Since the airport is in zone C, make sure you get an "Anschlußfahrschein/Connection ticket A/C" for 1.60 €. This covers the journey part from Schönefeld (zone C) into zone A/B when using your badge ticket.
