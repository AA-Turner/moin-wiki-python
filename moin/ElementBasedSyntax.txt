Element-based syntax typically uses XML-like elements to either annotate parts of a Web page (see StructureAnnotation) or to introduce program code into the document (see PythonInWebPage). For example:

{{{
<table>
  <python-block>
  for item in items:
    </python-block>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td><python-expr>item.name</python-expr></td>
    </tr>
    <python-block>
    # End of for loop.
  </python-block>
</table>
}}}

One stated advantage of element-based syntax is that the document can be manipulated more easily with XML tools. Arguably, the use of PythonInWebPage techniques can complicate matters because the content of the program code elements requires additional parsing and analysis.
