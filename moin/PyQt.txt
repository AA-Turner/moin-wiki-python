== About PyQt ==

PyQt is Python bindings developed by Riverbank Computing Limited for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework. Qt itself is developed by Nokia's Qt Development Frameworks (formerly Trolltech). PyQt provides bindings for Qt 2 and Qt 3. !PyQt4, a separate set of bindings, covers the Qt 4 series of releases. PyQt is dual-licensed under the GPL version 2 and a commercial license. There are also official bindings from Nokia called [[http://www.pyside.org/|PySide]] available under LGPL.

!PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for [[http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt|Qt 4]] that exposes much of the functionality of Qt 4 to Python.
It contains over 600 classes that cover graphical user interfaces, XML handling, network communication, SQL databases, Web browsing and other technologies in Qt.

Many of the features are described on the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/PyQt4|About PyQt4]] page on the !PyQt Wiki.

== PyQt documentation ==

Current documentation is available at [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html]].

The PyQt Wiki contains more actively-updated information and examples:

 * A collection of links to books can be found on the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Books|Books]] page.
   * Mark Summerfield's book, '''Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt''', is an up-to-date guide to GUI application development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3. More information can be found at http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html. Mark recommends, incidentally, '''[[http://www.gui-bloopers.com/|GUI Bloopers]]''', as appropriate supplementary reading for PyQt programmers.
 * A list of tutorials can also be found on the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Tutorials|Tutorials]] page.
   * '''The PyQt4 tutorial''' available at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/ is often recommended to new users.

On this Wiki, you can find the following tutorials:

 * A tutorial presented by Jonathan Gardner at the 2003 Northwest Linux Fest is available at [[JonathanGardnerPyQtTutorial]].
 * A tutorial presented by Oleksandr Yakovlyev for embedding PyQt in C++/Qt application [[EmbedingPyQtTutorial]]

== PyQt applications ==

A list of applications that use !PyQt as their UI layer can be found on the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/SomeExistingApplications|SomeExistingApplications]] page of the !PyQt Wiki. This replaces the list previously found here.

Similarly, the [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Third_Party_Packages_and_Modules|Third_Party_Packages_and_Modules]] page provides a list of resources that can be used to help build applications with certain features.

== Links to other resources ==

A Wiki dedicated to PyQt and [[PyKDE]] can be found at [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki|The PyQt and PyKDE community Wiki]].  The
[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt||mailing list]]
is low in volume and high in quality.  The
[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/roadmap|Roadmap]]
is always valuable to read.

Phil Thompson was [[http://web.archive.org/web/20070208043017/http://dot.kde.org/1155075248/|interviewed about PyQt]] for [[http://dot.kde.org|KDE Dot News]] in August 2006, and

== Earlier Versions ==

'''This section describes PyQt version 3 (for Qt 3).'''

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Oracle]])
 * QScintilla, [[http://www.scintilla.org/|Scintilla-based]] rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser
 * SVG support
 * classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric4}}} from http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and the Sharp Zaurus.
