== About PyQt ==

PyQt is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework from Nokia's Qt Development Frameworks (formerly Trolltech). PyQt provides bindings for Qt 2 and Qt 3. PyQt4, a separate set of bindings, covers the Qt 4 series of releases. PyQt is dual-licensed under the GPL version 2 and a commercial license. There are also official Nokia bindings called [[http://www.pyside.org/|PySide]] available under LGPL.

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Oracle]])
 * QScintilla, [[http://www.scintilla.org/|Scintilla-based]] rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser
 * SVG support
 * classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric4}}} from http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and the Sharp Zaurus. 

== PyQt4 ==

PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for [[http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt|Qt 4]] that exposes much of the functionality of Qt 4 to Python. This version of PyQt is described in more detail on the PyQt4 page.

== PyQt documentation ==

Current documentation is available at [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html]].

Mark Summerfield's book, '''Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt''', is an up-to-date guide to GUI application development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3. More information can be found at http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html. Mark recommends, incidentally, '''[[http://www.gui-bloopers.com/|GUI Bloopers]]''', as appropriate supplementary reading for PyQt programmers.

Boudewijn Rempt's book, '''GUI Programming with Python: Qt Edition''', is available at http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/.

'''The PyQt4 tutorial''' available at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/

A tutorial presented by Jonathan Gardner at the 2003 Northwest Linux Fest is available at [[JonathanGardnerPyQtTutorial]].

A Wiki dedicated to PyQt and [[PyKDE]] can be found at [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki|The PyQt and PyKDE community Wiki]].  The
[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt||mailing list]]
is low in volume and high in quality.  The
