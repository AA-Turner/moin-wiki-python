== About PyQt ==

PyQt is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework from Nokia's Qt Development Frameworks (former Qt Software, previously renamed from Trolltech). PyQt provides bindings for Qt 2 and Qt 3. PyQt4, a separate set of bindings, covers the Qt 4 series of releases. PyQt is licensed as GPL and commercial. There are also official Nokia bindings called PySide available under LGPL.

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Oracle]])
 * QScintilla, [[http://www.scintilla.org/|Scintilla-based]] rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser
 * SVG support
 * classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric4}}} from http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and the Sharp Zaurus. 

== PyQt4 ==

PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for [[http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt|Qt 4]] that exposes much of the functionality of Qt 4 to Python. This version of PyQt is described in more detail on the PyQt4 page.

== PyQt documentation ==

Current documentation is available at [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html]].

Mark Summerfield's book, '''Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt''', is an up-to-date guide to GUI application development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3. More information can be found at http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html.
Mark recommends, incidentally, 
'''[[http://www.gui-bloopers.com/|GUI Bloopers]]''', as
appropriate supplementary reading for PyQt programmers.

Boudewijn Rempt's book, '''GUI Programming with Python: Qt Edition''', is available at http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/.

'''The PyQt4 tutorial''' available at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/

A tutorial presented by Jonathan Gardner at the 2003 Northwest Linux Fest is available at [[JonathanGardnerPyQtTutorial]].

A Wiki dedicated to PyQt and [[PyKDE]] can be found at [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki|The PyQt and PyKDE community Wiki]].  The
[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt||mailing list]]
is low in volume and high in quality.  The
