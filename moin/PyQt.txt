PyQt is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt GUI/XML/SQL C++ toolkit from Trolltech.

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"])
 * a rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser

PyQt includes a graphical debugger, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux and the Sharp Zaurus. MacOS X will be supported in a future release.
