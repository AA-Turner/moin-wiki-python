== About PyQt ==

PyQt is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework from Trolltech. PyQt provides bindings for Qt 2 and Qt 3. PyQt4, a separate set of bindings, covers the Qt 4 series of releases.

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"], ["Oracle"])
 * QScintilla, [http://www.scintilla.org/ Scintilla-based] rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser
 * SVG support
 * classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric3}}} from http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and the Sharp Zaurus. 

== PyQt4 ==

PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for [http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt Qt 4] that exposes much of the functionality of Qt 4 to Python. This version of PyQt is described in more detail on the PyQt4 page.

== PyQt documentation ==

Current documentation is available at [http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html].
