PyQt is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt GUI/XML/SQL C++ toolkit from Trolltech.

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:
 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, ["MySQL"], ["PostgreSQL"], ["Oracle"])
 * a rich text editor widget
 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric3}}} from http://www.die-offenbachs.de/detlev/eric3.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux and the Sharp Zaurus. MacOS X will be supported in a future release under a license, similar to Qt (see http://www.trolltech.com/products/licensing.html). 

Boudewijn Rempt's book, '''GUI Programming with Python: Qt Edition''', is available at http://www.opendocspublishing.com/pyqt/.
