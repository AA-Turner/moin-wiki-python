== About PyQt ==

PyQt is one of the two most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework (another binding is PySide). PyQt developed by [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com|Riverbank Computing Limited]]. Qt itself is developed as part of the [[http://qt-project.org|Qt Project]]. PyQt provides bindings for Qt 4 and Qt 5. PyQt is distributed under a [[PyQt/PyQtLicensing|choice of licences]]: GPL version 2, GPL version 3, or a commercial license.

PyQt is available in two editions: !PyQt4 which will build against Qt 4.x and 5.x and !PyQt5 which will only build against 5.x. Both editions can be built for Python 2 and 3. PyQt contains over 620 classes that cover graphical user interfaces, XML handling, network communication, SQL databases, Web browsing and other technologies available in Qt.

The latest iteration of PyQt is v5.4. It fully supports Qt 5.4 which adds support for !QtBluetooth, !QtPositioning, !QtMacExtras, !QtWinExtras and !QtX11Extras.

== PyQt Documentation ==

Current documentation is available for [[http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/|PyQt4]] and [[http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/|PyQt5]].

The PyQt Wiki contains more actively-updated information and examples:

 * A collection of links to books can be found on the [[PyQt/Books|Books]] page.
  * Mark Summerfield's book, '''Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt''', is an up-to-date guide to GUI application development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3. More information can be found at http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html. Mark recommends, incidentally, '''[[http://www.gui-bloopers.com/|GUI Bloopers]]''', as appropriate supplementary reading for PyQt programmers.

 * A list of tutorials can also be found on the [[PyQt/Tutorials|Tutorials]] page.
  * '''The PyQt4 tutorial''' available at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/ is often recommended to new users.

On this Wiki, you can find the following tutorials:

 * A tutorial presented by Jonathan Gardner at the 2003 Northwest Linux Fest is available at JonathanGardnerPyQtTutorial.

 * A tutorial presented by Oleksandr Yakovlyev for embedding PyQt in C++/Qt application EmbedingPyQtTutorial

== Developing with PyQt and PyKDE ==

 * [[PyQt/Tutorials|Tutorials]] contains a list of tutorials and walkthroughs
 * [[PyQt/Books|Books]] contains a list of books about Qt, PyQt, KDE and PyKDE
 * [[PyQt/DevelopmentWithPyQt|Development With PyQt]] can be made even easier with some extra tools and information
 * [[PyQt/SampleCode|Sample Code]] lists some pieces of code to solve some common programming problems
 * [[PyQt/Overviews_and_Guides|Overviews and Guides]] provides in-depth information and detailed examples
 * [[PyQt/DocsAndHowtos|Docs And Howtos]] contains links to API documentation and articles about developing with PyQt and PyKDE
 * [[PyQt/SomeExistingApplications|Some Existing Applications]] written with !PyQt and PyKDE
 * [[PyQt/Third_Party_Packages_and_Modules|Third Party Packages and Modules]] for use with !PyQt and PyKDE
 * [[PyQt/GUI_Testing|GUI Testing]]
 * [[PyQt/PyQtVideos|Videos]] about !PyQt on various video sites

== PyQt Applications ==

A list of applications that use !PyQt as their UI layer can be found on the [[PyQt/SomeExistingApplications|Some Existing Applications]] page. This replaces the list previously found here.

Similarly, the [[PyQt/Third_Party_Packages_and_Modules|Third Party Packages and Modules]] page provides a list of resources that can be used to help build applications with certain features.

A collection of [[PyQt/SampleCode|Sample Code]] is also available to help with specific problems and use cases.

== Links to other resources ==
The http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt is low in volume and high in quality.  The [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/roadmap|Roadmap]] is always valuable to read.

Phil Thompson was [[http://web.archive.org/web/20070208043017/http://dot.kde.org/1155075248/|interviewed about PyQt]] for [[http://dot.kde.org|KDE Dot News]] in August 2006, and [[http://web.archive.org/web/20010201180600/http://www.sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-05-2000/swol-05-regex_2.html|profiled]] for ''!SunWorld Online'' in 2000.

== Earlier Versions ==
'''This section describes PyQt version 3 (for Qt 3).'''

PyQt implements around 300 classes and over 5,750 functions and methods including:

 * a substantial set of GUI widgets
 * classes for accessing SQL databases (ODBC, [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Oracle]])

 * QScintilla, [[http://www.scintilla.org/|Scintilla-based]] rich text editor widget

 * data aware widgets that are automatically populated from a database
 * an XML parser
 * SVG support
 * classes for embedding ActiveX controls on Windows (only in commercial version)

Earlier versions of PyQt included a graphical debugger called {{{eric}}}, written using PyQt, which can be used to debug PyQt and ordinary Python console applications. It's now available separately as {{{eric4}}} from http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html.

PyQt includes {{{pyuic}}} which generates Python code from GUI designs created with Qt Designer. This makes PyQt very useful as a rapid prototyping tool for applications that will eventually be (partly or completely) implemented in C++ because the user interface designs can be re-used without modification.

PyQt is available for Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and the Sharp Zaurus.
