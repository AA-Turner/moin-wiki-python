== Complete SSL support ==

Add full SSL support to the socket module, especially support for running SSL servers. <<BR>>
This module should provide comprehensive SSL/TLS support (client and server support,
certificate handling, algorithm selection...).

....
Because three already existing modules to do this isn't enough yet? So we need yet another one? '''''Say What?'''''. Please nobody do this...

''People have requested better SSL support to be included in core Python.  Perhaps one of the existing modules could be made acceptable for inclusion into the core. --amk''
