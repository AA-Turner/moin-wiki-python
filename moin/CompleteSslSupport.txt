== Complete SSL support ==

Remove SSL support from the socket module and create a stand-alone module for SSL handling.[[BR]]
This module should provide comprehensive SSL/TLS support (client and server support,
certificate handling, algorithm selection...).

....

Because three already existing modules to do this isn't enough yet? So we need yet another one? '''''Say What?'''''. Please nobody do this...
