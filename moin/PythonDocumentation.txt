'''Discussion:'''

Please!! get a wiki running side-by-side with the docs eg: 1 corresponding wikiable page for every page here in the pydocs. The startup data is simply that of the docs, so just mirror their structure. Then after the wiki docs start offering lots of useful information, the actual doc writers can incorporate this. To summarize, I think Python's documentation (like the library reference) is basically a big melange of api data and some snippets of useful info. This wiki will help replace those places that just use API data to fill up space, and turn it into something better.

Like the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/ PHP Manual] at [http://www.php.net/].
