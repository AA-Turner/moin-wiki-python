== Current documentation ==

Python's documentation is found online at [[docs.python.org|https://docs.python.org/]], including all current translations.

== End-of-life releases ==

Older versions of the standard documentation are kept available as well, since many users have to maintain code for older versions of the interpreter as well.  These can be found at https://www.python.org/doc/versions.html.

=== Other resources ===

The [[Python website|https://www.python.org/doc/] lists other resources, including books and alternative introductory material.
