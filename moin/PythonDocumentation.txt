Documentation for Python and related libraries falls into a variety of categories.
The first that most users encounter is the ''standard documentation'', which can
be found in a variety of places.

== Standard Documentation ==

The standard documentation for the most recent stable release of Python can always
be found at http://docs.python.org/.  It's easy to search that version using Google;
the search box at the top of the page on that site will perform a Google search of
only that site.  Downloadable versions for printing and interactive use are also made
available at that location.

Older versions of the standard documentation are kept available as well, since many
users have to maintain code for older versions of the interpreter as well.  These
can be found at http://www.python.org/doc/versions.html.

The standard documentation is maintained as part of the Python sources, and is
released along with Python itself.  This should be considered the most definitive
documentation on the language definition, the standard library, and the programming
interface for the CPython interpreter itself.

== Published Books ==

There are a range of PythonBooks that have been published in printed forms by a
variety of commercial publishers.  These range from introductory material on
programming using Python as an example language to in-depth treatments of specific
topics from a Python programmer's perspective.  Look for them at your favorite
bookseller, or check them out from your local public or university library.

== Alternate Introductory Documentation ==

Additional introductory and tutorial materials are also available; a list of pointers
is maintained at http://www.python.org/doc/Intros.html.

== Non-English Documentation ==

There are a number of documents and other resources available for Python users in
languages other than English.  These include translations of standard and third-party
documents as well as original documents written in other languages.  A list of these
is maintained at http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html.

== Quick Reference Guides ==

Sometimes all you need is a hint.  Many people have created quick reference guides
over the years.  The list below was culled from a posting to [[news:comp.lang.python]]:

== Eclipse SDK Documentation plugin ==

An easy-to use standard Python documentation plugin for Eclipse SDK.  Very handy 
if you need to get a quick reference from official Python documentation.
