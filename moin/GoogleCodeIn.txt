= Adding new tasks =

Add new tasks only in the above 8 categories.

Within each category tasks should sorted by difficulty level:
 1. Novice - these tasks can be done by someone with no experience working with the project
 2. Median - these tasks are suitable for someone with some experience in a project
 3. Expert - these tasks require knowledge in a specific field or extreme familiarity with a project

Task ideas should be tagged with the subproject they should be mentored for, currently:
 * stdlib - Python's Standard Library
 * packaging - The distutils (stdlib) or distutils2 projects
 * wsgi - Web Service Gateway Interface
