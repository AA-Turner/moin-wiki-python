Tasks need to be organized into eight categories:
 1. Code: Tasks related to writing or refactoring code
 2. Documentation: Tasks related to creating/editing documents
 3. Outreach: Tasks related to community management and outreach/marketing
 4. Quality Assurance: Tasks related to testing and ensuring code is of high quality
 5. Research: Tasks related to studying a problem and recommending solutions
 6. Training: Tasks related to helping others learn more
 7. Translation: Tasks related to localization
 8. User Interface: Tasks related to user experience research or user interface design and interaction

Within each category tasks should sorted by difficulty level:
 1. Novice - these tasks can be done by someone with no experience working with the project
 2. Median - these tasks are suitable for someone with some experience in a project
 3. Expert - these tasks require knowledge in a specific field or extreme familiarity with a project

Task ideas should be tagged with the subproject they should be mentored for, currently:
 * stdlib - Python's Standard Library
 * packaging - The distutils (stdlib) or distutils2 projects. 

For example:
 * Complete documentation for the wsgiref module [median] (stdlib)
 * Clean up Distutils2 code using "pep8" and "pyflake" (or "flake8") [novice] (packaging)
 * Enhance the Distutils2 mkcfg wizard (script to create a Distutils2 package) [median] (packaging)
