ActiveState seems to have the python snippet market well served http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/334696.  Its unfortunate they beat the python community to it, now they have a pretty big market share.

Can we successfull encourage new contributions to come to this wiki instead?  Do we want that?

Can (legally/technically)/should we mine the content from ActiveState to seed this wiki?
