ActiveState seems to have the python snippet market well served http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/334696.  Its unfortunate they beat
the python community to it, now they have a pretty big market share. JeanJordaan: I think 
they are *part* of the Python community, and they're doing a good job hosting the Cookbook. 

Can we successfully encourage new contributions to come to this wiki instead?  Do we want that?
JJ: Why? Don't do the same job again. Rather add value, e.g. by coordinating editors who rate
and edit recipes at the ASPN cookbook. 

Can (legally/technically)/should we mine the content from ActiveState to seed this wiki?
