ActiveState seems to have the python snippet market well served [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/334696 (example.)] Its unfortunate they beat
the python community to it, now they have a pretty big market share. -- anon

I think they are *part* of the Python community, and they're doing a good job hosting the Cookbook. -- JeanJordaan

Can we successfully encourage new contributions to come to this wiki instead?  Do we want that? -- anon

Why? Don't do the same job again. Rather add value, e.g. by coordinating editors who rate
and edit recipes at the ASPN cookbook. -- JeanJordaan

Can (legally/technically)/should we mine the content from ActiveState to seed this wiki? -- anon

I don't think we should try to move it. They do an excellent job as far as I can tell. Why not let the community grow rather than try to restrict it? -- anon

I don't believe we should try to move it either. Trying to manipulate someone's else community like that- that's asking for trouble.

That said, I believe so strongly in the advantages of wiki over the ActiveStateCookbook, that I ''personally'' put ''all'' of my snippet contributions here.

To answer JeanJordaan's question, the reasons I ''personally'' want to work on this wiki, and mainly encourage people to contribute here, are as follows:

 * wiki [http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/WhatIsAffordance affords] linking between pages
 * we can correct each others' mistakes, without working through an editor
 * we can organize each others' contributions

This is not earth shattering, and these reasons are [http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/WhyWikiWorks not new.] We've [http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/HeardItAllBefore heard it all before.] But, you asked.

I believe our situation is this:
 * Many people want to put snippets on the ActiveStateCookbook.
 * Many people want to put snippets on this wiki.
 * Some people may be undecided, and it may be useful, perhaps, to make an exploration of the advantages of each side here.
 * We probably don't want to get in an emotional argument over this.
