ActiveState seems to have the python snippet market well served [[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/334696|(example.)]] Its unfortunate they beat
the python community to it, now they have a pretty big market share. -- anon

I think they are *part* of the Python community, and they're doing a good job hosting the Cookbook. -- JeanJordaan

Can we successfully encourage new contributions to come to this wiki instead?  Do we want that? -- anon

Why? Don't do the same job again. Rather add value, e.g. by coordinating editors who rate
and edit recipes at the ASPN cookbook. -- JeanJordaan

Can (legally/technically)/should we mine the content from ActiveState to seed this wiki? -- anon

I don't think we should try to move it. They do an excellent job as far as I can tell. Why not let the community grow rather than try to restrict it? -- anon

 * I don't think we can mine the ActiveStateCookbook to seed the wiki. 
 * I will put all of my code snippets here.

Advantages of wiki over the ActiveStateCookbook:

 * wiki [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/WhatIsAffordance|affords]] linking between pages
 * we can correct each others' mistakes, without working through an editor
 * we can organize each others' contributions

I believe our situation is this:
 * Many people want to put snippets on the ActiveStateCookbook.
 * Many people want to put snippets on this wiki.

I think the PythonInfoWiki isn't living up to it's potential. As far as I can tell, we are fragmentary, and nobody seems committed to the wiki. We don't even know who runs it. -- LionKimbro <<DateTime(2006-03-30T16:19:29Z)>>
