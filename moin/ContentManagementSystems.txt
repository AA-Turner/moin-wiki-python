The only production-quality python-based CMSes are those in the ["Zope"] world such as [http://www.plone.org Plone], [http://www.cps-project.org Nuxeo CPS] and [http://www.infrae.com/products/silva Silva]. 

For those wanting lighterweight non-Zope CMS solutions, there are very few options and apparently those are works in progress.  If you are happy to code and send patches, you might want to look at the following, otherwise stick with Plone  and its Zope-based cousins.

 * There is the [http://nevow.com/ Nevow]-based [http://payago.com/ Payago], a lightweight website management system.
 * For ["Webware"] there is the [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/webware-sandbox/Sandbox/fbar/teeny_tiny_cms/ teeny_tiny_cms] which uses SQLObject, SQLite and Docutils.
 * [http://www.djangoproject.com/ Django] and [http://turbogears.org/ TurboGears] web frameworks are suitable for rapid CMS creation.

[http://www.pylucid.org PyLucid] is a lightweight CMS. No shell account is needed. To run !PyLucid you need a standard Webserver with Python (at least v2.2.1) CGI and mySQLdb.

And for some applications, you maybe want to use a wiki (a very simple sort of CMS), like MoinMoin (this is what is used right here).
