A very easy to use and powerful Python interface to the [http://www.libsdl.org SDL] platform independent graphics (and sound etc) libs.

There are plenty of examples, and the docs are very good. You'll be surprised at how easy it is to write graphics programs with it.

You can find it at http://www.pygame.org
