Once the registration cost has been decided, we should submit a 
listing to the [http://wpni.technews.com/cgi-bin/udt/EVENT.EDIT?client=washtech&submitter=USER Washington Post's event calendar].

The CFP has been sent to the local Linux UG mailing lists ( [http://novalug.tux.org NoVALUG] [http://dclug.tux.org/ DC-LUG]).
We should also send notices of the registration there.
