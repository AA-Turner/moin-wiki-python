= Web Components =

For use with some of the frameworks listed on WebFrameworks, the components/libraries/toolkits on this page often attempt to solve common problems in a way that can work with more than one particular framework; the idea being that you choose the component which does a particular job and it hopefully works with the framework you're developing your application in.

== Authorisation Toolkits ==

These allow you to add authorisation to your web applications. 

 * [http://authkit.org/ AuthKit] is a WSGI framework that provides a structure for implementing your own authorisation and authentication system. 
 * [http://www.chrisarndt.de/en/software/python/#auth Auth modules] - a module collection for authentication purposes
 * [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#dataenc Dataenc] - allows secure and time limited logins to be encoded into Web pages for use with Web applications
 * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/305288 HTTP basic authentication example]

== Form Handling ==
 
 * [http://formencode.org/ FormEncode] - is a validation and form generation package.  
 * [http://formbuild.org/ FormBuild] - FormBuild is a package designed to help with the generation of HTML form components. 
 * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/twForms/ twForms] - Web Widgets for building and validating forms.

== Request Dispatchers ==

A dispatcher takes the requests (i.e. the URL that a user types in) and then provides the response (i.e. the web application that creates the webpage that the user sees).  

 * [http://routes.groovie.org/ Routes] is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's. Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URL's that are RESTful with little effort.
 * [http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/ selector] - provides WSGI middleware for "RESTful" mapping of URL paths to WSGI applications.
 * [http://wsgiarea.pocoo.org/colubrid/ Colubrid] is a WSGI publisher which simplifies Python web developement.If you've ever created a WSGI application without a framework of an request handler you know how hard this can be.

== Templating Engines ==

Templating engines allow you to separate your application code from the presentation. Many of these engines can be used alone or within a high-level framework.

 * [http://www.myghty.org/ Myghty ] (1.0 Released 2006-01-27) is a Python based templating framework originally based on HTML::Mason
 * [http://www.makotemplates.org/ Mako] is an all-new templating engine which represents the best ideas of Myghty distilled into a completely-rewritten and updated API and syntax.
 * [http://www.thomas-lotze.de/en/software/ophelia/ Ophelia] (0.3 Released 2007-07-06) Generates XHTML pages from TAL templates. This avoids repetitive code, allows the site content to reside in the file system instead of a database, and lets Python scripts make the content dynamic.
 * ["JonsPythonModules"] (1.06 Released 2004-04-11) a set of simple yet powerful multi-threaded object-oriented CGI/FastCGI/mod_python/html-templating modules for Python
 * [http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ Cheetah] - Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator. It may be used as a standalone utility or combined with other tools.
 * [http://genshi.edgewall.org/ Genshi] is a Python library that provides an integrated set of components for parsing, generating, and processing HTML, XML or other textual content for output generation on the web.
