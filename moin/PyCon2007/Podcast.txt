= Releases signed =

We can go ahead and proceed with editing these talks.

= No release =

We have audio for these talks, but not release forms.  I'll write the
authors and ask if they signed a release, wish to sign one now, 
or want the raw audio for their own talk.

Developing with Dabo
Topographica (possibly partial)

= Keynotes =

We have sizable chunks of the  GvR, Krstic, and Lefkowitz keynotes; I haven't 
verified whether we actually have every minute of those talks.

There's 12 minutes of audio from the Goldberg keynote, but that's not enough
for us to post.
