'''Creating Command Line Tools With Python'''



The Python standard library has many modules that make creating commandline tools quite simple.  Often command line tools are made with pure Python modules, or are a mixture of calls to an operating system and Python, through the subprocess module.  Some of the commonly used modules to create commandline tools are:  optparse, configparser, and subprocess.
