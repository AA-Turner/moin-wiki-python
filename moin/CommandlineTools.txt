== Creating Command Line Tools With Python ==

=== Standard library support for parsing command lines ===

 * [[https://docs.python.org/library/optparse.html|optparse]] and [[https://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html|argparse]] (optparse is marked as deprecated since the introduction of argparse with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2, use argparse unless you have to support older Python versions)
 * [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/getopt.html|getopt]] C-style command line parser

The [[https://docs.python.org/howto/argparse.html|Argparse Tutorial]] is an excellent read for getting you started with creating command line tools.
