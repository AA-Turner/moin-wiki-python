DCPython Meetup Sprint Plan (Nov 2010)
======================================

This is the project planning page for the
`Python Beginner's Open Source Sprint
<http://meetup.zpugdc.org/calendar/15036971/>`__, organized
by the `DCPython Meetup <http://meetup.zpugdc.org/>`__
(primarily Alex Clark).

There are a lot of people planning to attend, so a little advance
planning is worthwhile.  If people can figure out what projects
they want to work on and use this page to connect with others
interested in the same projects, it should be easier to get
ourselves organized when we get together.

This is organized with a section for each "larger" project.  If
you're interested in a project listed here, add your name and
any emphasis you'd like to bring to the sprint.  If you want to
work on a project not listed already, add it!


Beginners
---------

Everyone attending the sprint that has never sprinted before, add your name under "Developers". If you plan to be available to help these folks, add your name and add (helper) afterward.

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Alex Clark <AlexClark>`__ (helper)
* `Fred Drake <FredDrake>`__ (helper)
* `Eric Groo`
* `Owen Martin`
* `Barry Austin`
* `Bob Schmertz`
* `Mohamed Ainab <MohamedAinab>`
* Eric Palakovich Carr
* Londell
* Gabriel Getzie
* Mike Onzay
* Adam Reilly
* Sergejs Melderis

Tasks
~~~~~

* Pick a project
* Get your laptop setup for development
* Fix bugs!


Python core
-----------

The interpreter and standard library.

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Eric Smith <EricSmith>`__
* `Fred Drake <FredDrake>`__

Tasks
~~~~~

* `PEP-382 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0382/>`__, namespace packages
* Add `alternate float format specifiers <http://bugs.python.org/issue7094>`__ (and Decimal, if time)
* Straighten out the JSON issues:

  * `json.load failure when C optimizations aren't built
    <http://bugs.python.org/issue9233>`__

  * `Incomplete json tests
    <http://bugs.python.org/issue5723>`__


distutils2 (d2)
---------------

The next generation of Python packaging.  You'll need `Mercurial
(hg) <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`__ for revision control, and
several versions of Python.
See http://bitbucket.org/fdrake/d2dev/src/tip/README.txt for
detailed preparation instructions.

For this, it's important to use "clean" Pythons; you don't want
to have any extras installed in your site-python directory.

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Fred Drake <FredDrake>`__
* `Alex Clark <Alex Clark>`__
* `Arc Riley <ArcRiley>`__

Tasks
~~~~~

* Remove fancygetopt; move to a clean application of optparse.

* the command line tool is now in run.py, with new options,
  and pass it to dist+fancygetopt to call the old system
  so what could be done is to list:

  1. all command line options in dist.py that are not a call to a command and its options
  2. move them to run.py
  3. remove fancygetopt and clean up dist.

* Try converting a few projects to use d2, preferably based on the
  documentation alone.

* Continue the work on py3 support (ask tarek or regebro on irc)


Zope Toolkit (ZTK)
------------------


Django
------

Look at fixing some long-standing and reasonably trivial documentation issues.
Shared exploration of the code base. Help 1.3 get out the door.

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~
* `Steve Holden <SteveHolden>`__ but not on my own! ;-)
* `Steve Waterbury <StephenWaterbury>`__ but this is not a Steves-only project! ;-)
* `Alex Clark <AlexClark>`__ Maybe I'll watch! :-)
* Eric Palakovich Carr
* Adam Reilly


Tasks
~~~~~

* http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/4027
* http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3529
* http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Sprints#Preparingforthesprint

Possibly consider whether context objects might benefit from the use
of structural modifications.


Plone
-----

Python-based, open-source CMS


Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Alex Clark <AlexClark>`__


Tasks
~~~~~

* PloneSoftwareCenter add-on (http://plone.org/products/plonesoftwarecenter) development

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Alex Clark <AlexClark>`__


Tasks
~~~~~

* Improve test coverage from 50% to 100% for parse2plone
  (you'll need a github account for this, so you can fork:
  https://github.com/collective/parse2plone and send me pull requests.)


zc.buildout
-----------

A tool for creating repeatable environments

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Alex Clark <AlexClark>`__


Tasks
~~~~~

* Fix bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout



DCPython Meetup Sprint Wrap Up (Nov 2010) 
=========================================


distutils2
~~~~~~~~~~

* People

   * Fred Drake
   * Alex Clark
   * Travis (last name?)
   * Arc Riley
   * Jim Fulton



* Progress

   * Fred schooled Travis and I and Jim in distutils2 setup, with a dev
     environment from:

         * http://bitbucket.org/fdrake/d2dev and a distutils2 checkout
           from:
         * https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distutils2

   * We ran the tests, but unfortunately to get much further than that
   * Fred worked on ripping out the "Fancy option parser" to replace it
     with optparse.
   * Arc did something, but I'm not sure what :-)


zc.buildout
~~~~~~~~~~~

* People

   * Jim Fulton
   * Alex Clark


* Progress

   * Jim and I brainstormed on the status quo: "brittle tests" (i.e.
     tests giving spurious results depending on the system they are
     being run on), and then began to fix tests.
   * Jim worked on a test failure having to do with zc.recipe.egg tests
     that used the interpreter parameter to create a script ; the
     script being created in the tests used a technique only valid on
     newer ubuntus and Windows (where #!/path/to/exe refers to another
     script that has #!/path/to/exe instead of an executable)
   * I worked on a test having to do with Buildout being able to work
     with more than one version of Python ; so the test requires that
     more than one version of Python be found. I committed a
     "modernization" here:
     http://svn.zope.org/zc.buildout/?rev=118514&view=rev
     <http://svn.zope.org/zc.buildout/?rev=118514&view=rev> (to make
     the test find 2.6 and 2.5 vs. 2.4 and 2.3)

         * I plan to do further improvements that will make the test

           look for all 2.x versions.



beginners
~~~~~~~~~

* People

   * Steve Holden
   * XXX Fill me in


* Progress

   * Steve Holden corralled beginners and discussed basic Python concepts
   * Some of the beginners broke off to do a "fun" project
         * The "fun" project group mostly worked on bootstrapping an
           Android environment to develop Android apps with Python


core
~~~~

* People

   * Eric Smith
   * XXX Fill me in


* Progress

   * Eric Smith corralled some folks into working on a core bug fix,
     and I think they submitted a patch


django
~~~~~~

* People

   * Steve Holden
   * XXX Fill me in


* Progress

   * Steve Holden and at least one other person worked on and submitted
     a documentation bug fix
   * Some group of folks worked on something Geo-Django related.
