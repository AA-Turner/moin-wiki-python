======================================
DCPython Meetup Sprint Plan (Nov 2010)
======================================

This is the project planning page for the
`Python Beginner's Open Source Sprint
<http://meetup.zpugdc.org/calendar/15036971/>`__, organized
by the `DCPython Meetup <http://meetup.zpugdc.org/>`__
(primarily Alex Clark).

There are a lot of people planning to attend, so a little advance
planning is worthwhile.  If people can figure out what projects
they want to work on and use this page to connect with others
interested in the same projects, it should be easier to get
ourselves organized when we get together.

This is organized with a section for each "larger" project.  If
you're interested in a project listed here, add your name and
any emphasis you'd like to bring to the sprint.  If you want to
work on a project not listed already, add it!
