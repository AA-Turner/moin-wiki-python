Gain valuable insights from your data by streamlining unstructured data pipelines with Python, Spark, and MongoDB

This course is a comprehensive, practical guide to using MongoDB and Spark in Python, learning how to store and make sense of huge data sets, and performing basic machine learning tasks to make predictions.

MongoDB is one of the most powerful non-relational database systems available offering robust scalability and expressive operations that, when combined with Python data analysis libraries and distributed computing, represent a valuable set of tools for the modern data scientist. NoSQL databases require a new way of thinking about data and scalable queries. Once Mongo queries have been mastered, it is necessary to understand how we can leverage this API in Python's rich analysis and visualization ecosystem. This course will cover how to use MongoDB, particularly if you are used to SQL databases, with a focus on scalability to large datasets. pyMongo is introduced as the means to interact with a MongoDB database from within Python code and the data structures used to do so are explored. MongoDB uniquely allows for complex operations and aggregations to be run within the query itself and we will cover how to use these operators. While MongoDB itself is built for easy scalability across many nodes as datasets grow, Python is not. Therefore, we cover how we can use Spark with MongoDB to handle more complex machine learning techniques for extremely large datasets. This learning will be applied to several examples of real-world datasets and analyses that can form the basis of your own pipelines, allowing you to quickly get up-and-running with a powerful data science toolkit.

Step-by-step guide filled with real-world practical examples

The video starts with a descriptive analysis to create insightful visualizations of internal structures such as trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation. Next, the statistical methods of dealing with autocorrelation and non-stationary time series are described. This is followed by exponential smoothing to produce meaningful insights from noisy time series data. At this point, we shift the focus towards predictive analysis and introduce autoregressive models such as ARMA and ARIMA for time series forecasting.

Later, powerful deep learning methods are presented to develop accurate forecasting models for complex time series. All the topics are illustrated with real-life problem scenarios and their solutions by best-practice implementations in Python.

Ensemble methods offer a powerful way to improve prediction accuracy by combining in a clever way predictions from many individual predictors. In this course, you will learn how to use ensemble methods to improve accuracy in classification and regression problems.

When using Predictive Analytics to solve actual problems, besides models and algorithms there are many other practical considerations that must be considered like which features should you use, how many features are enough, should you create new features, how to combine features to give the same underlying information, which hyper-parameters should you use? You explore topics that will help you answer such questions.

Artificial Neural Networks are models loosely based on how neural networks work in a living being. These models have a long history in the Artificial Intelligence community with ups and downs in popularity. Nowadays, because of the increase in computational power, improved methods, and software enhancements, they are popular again and are the basis for advanced approaches such as Deep Learning. This course introduces the use of Deep Learning models for Predictive Analytics using the powerful TensorFlow library.

'''Video Overview:'''

In this video course, you will learn what functional programming is, and how it differs from other programming styles, such as procedural and object-oriented programming. You will also learn why and when functional programming is useful, and why and when it makes programs unnecessarily complex. Explore lambda expressions, which are short one-line functions, and are the purest form of functional programming that Python offers. Next, learn about higher-order functions: functions that accept other functions as argument, or return other functions as return values. In Python, higher-order functions are elegantly supported through decorators. You will also encounter important concepts from functional programming, such as monads, currying, statelessness, side-effects, memoization, and referential transparency; these concepts may initially seem odd to Python programmers, but you will see how they are elegantly supported by the language. In fact, many Python programmers already make use of concepts from functional programming without being aware of doing so.

All the videos in this course contain hands-on examples of the introduced concepts.

'''What you will learn:'''

 * Recognize the value of Functional Programming
 * Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming
 * Higher-order functions and Lambda expressions (nameless functions)
 * Error handling in Functional Programming
 * Understand common functional design patterns, and how these apply to Python

'''Book Overview:'''

An efficient way to build applications to do this is through microservices architecture. But, in practice, it's hard to get this right due to the complexity of all the pieces interacting with each other.

This book will teach you how to overcome these issues and craft applications that are built as small standard units, using all the proven best practices and avoiding the usual traps. It's a practical book: you’ll build everything using Python 3 and its amazing tooling ecosystem. You will understand the principles of TDD and apply them.

This book will take you on a journey, ending with the creation of a complete Python application based on microservices. By the end of the book, you will be well versed with the fundamentals of building, designing, testing, and deploying your Python microservices.

'''What you will learn:'''

 * Explore what microservices are and how to design them
 * Use Python 3, Flask, Tox, and other tools to build your services using best practices
 * Learn how to use a TDD approach
 * Discover how to document your microservices
 * Configure and package your code in the best way
 * Interact with other services
 * Secure, monitor, and scale your services
 * Deploy your services in Docker containers, CoreOS, and Amazon Web Services

ISBN 13: 9781784397005  Packt Publishing 446 pages (June 2017)

'''Book Overview:'''

This book begins with a review of the TCP/ IP protocol suite and a refresher of the core elements of the Python language. Next, you will start using Python and supported libraries to automate network tasks from the current major network vendors. You will look at automating traditional network devices based on the command-line interface, as well as newer devices with API support, with hands-on labs. You will then learn the concepts and practical use cases of the Ansible framework in order to achieve your network goals.

You will then move on to using Python for DevOps, starting with using open source tools to test, secure, and analyze your network. Then, you will focus on network monitoring and visualization. You will learn how to retrieve network information using a polling mechanism, flow-based monitoring, and visualizing the data programmatically. Next, you will learn how to use the Python framework to build your own customized network web services.

In the last module, you will use Python for SDN, where you will use a Python-based controller with OpenFlow in a hands-on lab to learn its concepts and applications. Compare and contrast OpenFlow, OpenStack, OpenDaylight, and NFV. Finally, you will use everything you’ve learned in the book to construct a migration plan to go from a legacy to a scalable SDN-based network.

'''What you will learn:'''

 * Review all the fundamentals of Python and the TCP/IP suite
 * Use Python to execute commands when the device does not support the API or programmatic interaction with the device
 * Implement automation techniques by integrating Python with Cisco, Juniper, and Arista eAPI
 * Integrate Ansible using Python to control Cisco, Juniper, and Arista networks
 * Achieve network security with Python
 * Build Flask-based web-service APIs with Python
 * Construct a Python-based migration plan from a legacy to scalable SDN-based network
