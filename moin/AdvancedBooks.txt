'''Video Overview:'''

A practical approach to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3.

The world is filled with coders, who write pieces of programs in a bid to find solutions to various problems. In such a field where the competition is already intense, you need a definitive edge over the rest. One of the better ways to stay ahead of the pack is to write smarter code. Writing large programs can be painful. That’s where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes to the rescue. OOP saves a considerable amount of coding man-hours in the long run by writing code in a smarter way, through various techniques.

To ensure efficient coding, you will be introduced to Exceptions and Error Handling. Furthermore, Encapsulation with methods and variables will help you to keep data safe from external, unwanted interference. In the final sections, you will be taken through recursion mechanisms.

By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with the OOP techniques in Python 3, which will help you to write codes better and in an efficient manner.

Gain valuable insights from your data by streamlining unstructured data pipelines with Python, Spark, and MongoDB

This course is a comprehensive, practical guide to using MongoDB and Spark in Python, learning how to store and make sense of huge data sets, and performing basic machine learning tasks to make predictions.

MongoDB is one of the most powerful non-relational database systems available offering robust scalability and expressive operations that, when combined with Python data analysis libraries and distributed computing, represent a valuable set of tools for the modern data scientist. NoSQL databases require a new way of thinking about data and scalable queries. Once Mongo queries have been mastered, it is necessary to understand how we can leverage this API in Python's rich analysis and visualization ecosystem. This course will cover how to use MongoDB, particularly if you are used to SQL databases, with a focus on scalability to large datasets. pyMongo is introduced as the means to interact with a MongoDB database from within Python code and the data structures used to do so are explored. MongoDB uniquely allows for complex operations and aggregations to be run within the query itself and we will cover how to use these operators. While MongoDB itself is built for easy scalability across many nodes as datasets grow, Python is not. Therefore, we cover how we can use Spark with MongoDB to handle more complex machine learning techniques for extremely large datasets. This learning will be applied to several examples of real-world datasets and analyses that can form the basis of your own pipelines, allowing you to quickly get up-and-running with a powerful data science toolkit.

Ensemble methods offer a powerful way to improve prediction accuracy by combining in a clever way predictions from many individual predictors. In this course, you will learn how to use ensemble methods to improve accuracy in classification and regression problems.

When using Predictive Analytics to solve actual problems, besides models and algorithms there are many other practical considerations that must be considered like which features should you use, how many features are enough, should you create new features, how to combine features to give the same underlying information, which hyper-parameters should you use? You explore topics that will help you answer such questions.

Artificial Neural Networks are models loosely based on how neural networks work in a living being. These models have a long history in the Artificial Intelligence community with ups and downs in popularity. Nowadays, because of the increase in computational power, improved methods, and software enhancements, they are popular again and are the basis for advanced approaches such as Deep Learning. This course introduces the use of Deep Learning models for Predictive Analytics using the powerful TensorFlow library.

'''Video Overview:'''

In this video course, you will learn what functional programming is, and how it differs from other programming styles, such as procedural and object-oriented programming. You will also learn why and when functional programming is useful, and why and when it makes programs unnecessarily complex. Explore lambda expressions, which are short one-line functions, and are the purest form of functional programming that Python offers. Next, learn about higher-order functions: functions that accept other functions as argument, or return other functions as return values. In Python, higher-order functions are elegantly supported through decorators. You will also encounter important concepts from functional programming, such as monads, currying, statelessness, side-effects, memoization, and referential transparency; these concepts may initially seem odd to Python programmers, but you will see how they are elegantly supported by the language. In fact, many Python programmers already make use of concepts from functional programming without being aware of doing so.

All the videos in this course contain hands-on examples of the introduced concepts.

'''What you will learn:'''

 * Recognize the value of Functional Programming
 * Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming
 * Higher-order functions and Lambda expressions (nameless functions)
 * Error handling in Functional Programming
 * Understand common functional design patterns, and how these apply to Python
