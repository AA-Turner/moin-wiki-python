'''Foundations of Agile Python Development'''
 Jeff Younker

ISBN13: 978-1-59059-981-5
Apress Inc, 416 pages (June 2008)

You’ve long been enamored with the Python language, and have mastered its many nuances. Yet something seems to be missing—a productivity boost that you know is possible but you’re not sure how to go about it. This was the sentiment of so many developers before discovering Agile programming paradigm, which embraces concepts such as automation, effective code management, and test–driven development.

Foundations of Agile Python Development is the first book to apply these sought–after principles to Python developers, introducing both the tools and techniques built and supported by the Python community. Authored by Jeff Younker, a well–known member of Python’s agile community who is perhaps best known for his creation of a popular Python testing framework, this book is sure to be a hit among readers who may have reached their limits of knowledge regarding the Python language, yet are seeking to improve their understanding of how sound processes can boost productivity to unparalleled heights.

To guide readers through the new scripting language, Python, this book discusses every aspect of client and server programming. And as Python begins to replace Perl as a favorite programming language, this book will benefit scripters and serious application developers who want a feature-rich, yet simple language, for deploying their products.

The text explains multitasking network servers using several models, including forking, threading, and non-blocking sockets. Furthermore, the extensive examples demonstrate important concepts and practices, and provide a cadre of fully-functioning stand alone programs. Readers may even use the provided examples as building blocks to create their own software.

'''Design Patterns in Python'''
 [[http://www.testingperspective.com/?page_id=107|Rahul Verma]] and [[http://www.technobeans.wordpress.com/about/|Chetan Giridhar]]

Design Patterns in Python is about learning design patterns through the medium of Python language.

If you are a tester interested in design of test automation frameworks or thinking about how a single test automation problem could be solved in different ways, this book would prove to be very useful.

If you are new to design patterns being a programmer or you want to explore OOP in Python further, this text provides the first building blocks.

This first version of the book would be published as a PDF version by Jan-2011 end with the initial set of patterns. Over the course of 2011, we would add more patterns and release next versions.

(December 2001)

Bruce Eckel's python version of his "Thinking In..." series, and is freely downloadable (see below).  He's got some cool python stuff not generally covered elsewhere, including the use of design patterns.

This is not an introductory Python book. This book assumes you've learned the basics of Python elsewhere.  The current version of the book is 0.1.2. This is still a preliminary release, and Bruce needs feedback.  The html has a built-in comments system.


[[http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIPython|Home page]]

'''Note:''' The above book has been abandoned (not updated since 2001), Bruce is now writing another book on advanced Python, the working title of which is "Python 3 Patterns & Idioms". Bruce is building upon the 'good bits' from "Thinking in Python" and welcomes community collaboration in developing the book!
