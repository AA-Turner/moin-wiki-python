'''Book Overview:'''

Explore various verticals in software engineering through high-end systems using Python

Software Engineering is about more than just writing code—it includes a host of soft skills that apply to almost any development effort, no matter what the language, development methodology, or scope of the project. Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project's life cycle. 

This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You'll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world—Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation.

Gain valuable insights from your data by streamlining unstructured data pipelines with Python, Spark, and MongoDB

This course is a comprehensive, practical guide to using MongoDB and Spark in Python, learning how to store and make sense of huge data sets, and performing basic machine learning tasks to make predictions.

MongoDB is one of the most powerful non-relational database systems available offering robust scalability and expressive operations that, when combined with Python data analysis libraries and distributed computing, represent a valuable set of tools for the modern data scientist. NoSQL databases require a new way of thinking about data and scalable queries. Once Mongo queries have been mastered, it is necessary to understand how we can leverage this API in Python's rich analysis and visualization ecosystem. This course will cover how to use MongoDB, particularly if you are used to SQL databases, with a focus on scalability to large datasets. pyMongo is introduced as the means to interact with a MongoDB database from within Python code and the data structures used to do so are explored. MongoDB uniquely allows for complex operations and aggregations to be run within the query itself and we will cover how to use these operators. While MongoDB itself is built for easy scalability across many nodes as datasets grow, Python is not. Therefore, we cover how we can use Spark with MongoDB to handle more complex machine learning techniques for extremely large datasets. This learning will be applied to several examples of real-world datasets and analyses that can form the basis of your own pipelines, allowing you to quickly get up-and-running with a powerful data science toolkit.

When using Predictive Analytics to solve actual problems, besides models and algorithms there are many other practical considerations that must be considered like which features should you use, how many features are enough, should you create new features, how to combine features to give the same underlying information, which hyper-parameters should you use? You explore topics that will help you answer such questions.

Artificial Neural Networks are models loosely based on how neural networks work in a living being. These models have a long history in the Artificial Intelligence community with ups and downs in popularity. Nowadays, because of the increase in computational power, improved methods, and software enhancements, they are popular again and are the basis for advanced approaches such as Deep Learning.

'''Video Overview:'''

In this video course, you will learn what functional programming is, and how it differs from other programming styles, such as procedural and object-oriented programming. You will also learn why and when functional programming is useful, and why and when it makes programs unnecessarily complex. Explore lambda expressions, which are short one-line functions, and are the purest form of functional programming that Python offers. Next, learn about higher-order functions: functions that accept other functions as argument, or return other functions as return values. In Python, higher-order functions are elegantly supported through decorators. You will also encounter important concepts from functional programming, such as monads, currying, statelessness, side-effects, memoization, and referential transparency; these concepts may initially seem odd to Python programmers, but you will see how they are elegantly supported by the language. In fact, many Python programmers already make use of concepts from functional programming without being aware of doing so.

All the videos in this course contain hands-on examples of the introduced concepts.

'''What you will learn:'''

 * Recognize the value of Functional Programming
 * Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming
 * Higher-order functions and Lambda expressions (nameless functions)
 * Error handling in Functional Programming
 * Understand common functional design patterns, and how these apply to Python
