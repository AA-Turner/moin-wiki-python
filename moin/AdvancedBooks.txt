Bruce Eckel's python version of his "Thinking In..." series, and is freely downloadable (see below).  He's got some cool python stuff not generally covered elsewhere, including the use of design patterns.

This is not an introductory Python book. This book assumes you've learned the basics of Python elsewhere.  The current version of the book is 0.1.2. This is still a preliminary release, and Bruce needs feedback.  The html has a built-in comments system.
