'''Thinking in Python'''
 Bruce Eckel

ISBN: none yet<<BR>>
Mindview, Inc.
(December 2001)

Bruce Eckel's python version of his "Thinking In..." series, and is freely downloadable (see below).  He's got some cool python stuff not generally covered elsewhere, including the use of design patterns.

This is not an introductory Python book. This book assumes you've learned the basics of Python elsewhere.  The current version of the book is 0.1.2. This is still a preliminary release, and Bruce needs feedback.  The html has a built-in comments system.

'''Note:''' The above book has been abandoned (not updated since 2001), Bruce is now writing another book on advanced Python, the working title of which is "Python 3 Patterns & Idioms". Bruce is building upon the 'good bits' from "Thinking in Python" and welcomes community collaboration in developing the book!
