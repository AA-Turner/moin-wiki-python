Just attending, not presenting anything.

Currently using python in my phd (+/- construction industry plus semantic web).

Trying to get rdflib and zope working together: http://vanrees.org/weblog/1085667767

Main interests at the conference: the selling/business sessions, zope+archetypes+plone, especially the future directions for these projects.
