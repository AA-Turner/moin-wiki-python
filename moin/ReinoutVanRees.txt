I'm programming python and django (with lots of geo stuff) at http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Before my current job I did the following python-related things:

* I used to use python/zope/plone for my phd (+/- construction industry plus semantic web)
* I made plone websites for http://zestsoftware.nl
* I coded in grok for http://www.thehealthagency.com

http://reinout.vanrees.org/ is the best summary.

I've attended more than half of all Europythons and I'm a regular at the Dutch python usergroup meetings.
