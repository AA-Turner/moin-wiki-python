This page discusses the benefits of replacing the current `print` statement with an equivalent builtin. The `println` function presented below does everything the `print` statement does without requiring any hacking of the grammar, and also makes a number of things significantly easier.

=== Benefits of using a function instead of a statement ===
 * Extended call syntax provides better interaction with sequences
 * Keyword argument `sep` allows separator to be changed easily and obviously
 * Keyword argument `lnterm` allows line terminator to be changed easily and obviously
 * Keyword argument `stream` allows easy and obvious redirection
 * The builtin can be replaced for application wide customisation (e.g. per-thread logging)
 * Interacts well with PEP 309's partial function application

=== Getting there from here ===
The example implementation below shows that creating a function with the desired behaviour is quite straightforward. A problem only arises if we decide we want the builtin to have the name `print`. This seriously complicates transition, because `print` is a reserved word in Python 2.x. Since the `print` statement will be around until Py3K allows us to break backwards compatibility, devising a transition plan that lets programmers 'get ready early' for the Py3K transition becomes a significant challenge.

If, on the other hand, the builtin had a different name (such as `println`), it would be quite feasible to introduce it during the 2.x series, with the only change in Py3K being the final removal of the `print` statement.

Some names which have been suggested are:
 * `print` - excellent name, but causes severe transition problems as described above
 * `println` - avoids the transition problems, reflects default behaviour of adding a line, matches Java method name
 * `printline` - similar to `println`, but avoids the somewhat cryptic abbreviation
 * `out` - not a verb, and converting to it may be problematic due to shadowing by variable names
 * `output` - nice symmetry with input, but using the term as a verb is not typical

An alternative transition strategy would be to add `println` during the Python 2.x series, then, in Py3k, remove the `print` statement and replace it with a `print` builtin which did not append a trailing line separator, and did not support the `lnterm` keyword. The use of `println` with `lnterm = ''` would then simply be a transition strategy - normal Py3k usage would be to use `print` if you didn't want the newline added, and `println` if you did. The `lnterm` argument to `println` would typically only be used to get a different line separator, rather than to eliminate the line separator entirely.

This technique of having two methods is not uncommon - Java has both `print` and `println` methods, and C# has `Write` and `WriteLine`.

=== Sample implementation ===
This is a Python 2.4 compatible sample implementation, which is why it uses the name `println` rather than `print`.

    defaults = {

        "stream": sys.stdout,
    }
    for name, default in defaults.items():
        item = None
        try:
            item = kwds[name]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        if item is None:
            kwds[name] = default
    sep, lnterm, stream = kwds["sep"], kwds["lnterm"], kwds["stream"]
    # Perform the print operation without building the whole string
    for arg in args[:1]:
        stream.write(str(arg))
    for arg in args[1:]:
        stream.write(sep)
        stream.write(str(arg))
    stream.write(lnterm)

=== Code comparisons ===
These are some comparisons of current print statements with the equivalent code using the builtin.
