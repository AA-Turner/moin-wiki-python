= This page describes efforts to port pylint to Python 3.x =

== Status of the port ==
We're really just getting started.

== Goals and high level overview of tasks ==
The idea is to add support for Python 3.0 and 3.1, while eliminating Python 2.4 compatibility because that will simplify some of the code.
  * This will require one of the following methods:
    * Converting the three Python 2-compatible packages to a common subset of Python 2 and Python 3
      * We may or may not be able to do this using 2to3; 2to3 may or may not prove too exuberant about moving to a nice, python 3-only syntax in some areas.
    * Creating creating modules that abstract the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 and depending on them instead.
  * About the three packages
    * Those three packages are:
      1. logilab-common
        * This one is probably the place to start, because it appears to contain the test harness we need.
        * The owners of the code believe this will be the easiest part
        * 29274 lines of code initially
      1. logilab-astng
        * 18928 lines of code initially
      1. pylint itself
         * 28415 lines of code initially
    * There appear to be test suites for each of these, which can be invoked using the pytest command - pytest appears to be part of logilab-common, which suggests a bit of
      mutual dependency to work around.
  * The owners of the code would like to keep the changes compatible with Python 2.5.x to avoid having two code bases to maintain, which of course is a bit more involved
    than targeting 2.6 and up.
