= This page describes efforts to port pylint to Python 3.x =

== Status of the port ==
We're really just getting started.

== Goals and high level overview of tasks ==
The idea is to eliminate Python 2.4 compatibility because that will simplify some of the code, and to expand compatibility to 3.0 and 3.1.
  * This will require moving logilab common, logilab astng and pylint itself to python 3 using 2to3
  * There appear to be test suites for each of these, which can be invoked using the pytest command, which in turn appears to be part of logilab-common itself
  * The owners of the code would like to keep the changes compatible with Python 2.5.x, which of course is a bit more involved than targeting 2.6 and up.
