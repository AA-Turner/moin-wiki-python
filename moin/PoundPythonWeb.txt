This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for the #python.web IRC channel on Freenode.

=== Nobody's around! What do I do? ===

Okay, so nobody actually asks this, but we frequently see someone pop in, ask a question, and leave fifteen minutes later. A half hour later, someone unidles, and would answer the question, but the person who asked it is gone. So, if nobody answers your question, just stick around. We idle a lot.

=== What framework should I use? ===

This is widely considered to be one of the "religious" issues, along with choice of programming editor and operating system. There's also no substitute for experimenting with a wide range of frameworks. A good list can be found at WebProgramming.

That said, people keep asking for our opinions, so here they are:

JonRosebaugh says "Assuming you're interested in a MVC-style architecture, probably the most important consideration is how much support the framework has for [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html WSGI], because WSGI is the direction Python web programming is heading in. Some frameworks enthusiastically embrace WSGI, some have superficial support, and some don't address it at all. I'd recommend [http://pylonshq.com/ Pylons] and [http://www.turbogears.org/ TurboGears], as well as ["Django"] if you're looking at building a CMS-style site."

If you'd like to add your opinion, feel free to do so; if you'd like to disagree with what one of us wrote here, the best place to do that is probably on the IRC channel.

=== I need help with FooWeb framework! (Or: Why doesn't it work when I do bar?) ===

Well, we'll try to help. But we're not experts at everything, so don't be surprised if your question about running !FooWeb through [:ModPython:mod_python] on IRIX goes unanswered. There are times it may be better to seek out a community specific to your framework or toolkit.

Maybe there is also a channel for your framework. Here a list of known support channels on freenode:
 * #django for the django
 * #turbogears for turbogears
 * #pylons for pylons
 * #mygthy for mygthy
 * #pythonpaste for paste

=== My question wasn't covered here. ===

Well, come on in and ask it. We don't bite. Really.
