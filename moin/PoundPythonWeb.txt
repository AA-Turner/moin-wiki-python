This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for the #python.web IRC channel on Freenode.

=== Nobody's around! What do I do? ===

Okay, so nobody actually asks this, but we frequently see someone pop in, ask a question, and leave fifteen minutes later. A half hour later, someone unidles, and would answer the question, but the person who asked it is gone. So, if nobody answers your question, just stick around. We idle a lot.

=== Can you help me with mod_python? ===

Sure. Don't use mod_python. 

It causes people no end of trouble and was never really a good idea in the first place. Yes, this is our opinion, but it's an opinion that's been borne out by experience. If you think #python.web ought to help people with mod_python, great. Come give help. We can use active people.

=== What framework should I use? ===

This is widely considered to be one of the "religious" issues, along with choice of programming editor and operating system. There's also no substitute for experimenting with a wide range of frameworks. A good list can be found at WebProgramming.

That said, people keep asking for our opinions, so here they are:

JonRosebaugh (Chairos) says "Assuming you're interested in a MVC-style architecture, probably the most important consideration is how much support the framework has for [[http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html|WSGI]], because WSGI is the direction Python web programming is heading in. Some frameworks enthusiastically embrace WSGI, some have superficial support, and some don't address it at all. I'd recommend [[http://pylonshq.com/|Pylons]] (and [[http://www.turbogears.org/|TurboGears]], once TG2 is out). [[http://www.djangoproject.com/|Django]] is also good for apps that don't need too much in the way of flexibility."

patx says "Well if you are using Windows, then [[http://cherrypy.org|CherryPy]] is a very good choice for small web servers or if you want to use a Python framework on Apache. Another good one for Linux systems (not for Windows because there are still some small bugs) is [[http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/circuits|circuits]]. circuits is a Lightweight, Event driven Framework with a strong Component Architecture."

If you'd like to add your opinion, feel free to do so; if you'd like to disagree with what one of us wrote here, the best place to do that is probably on the IRC channel.

=== I need help with FooWeb framework! (Or: Why doesn't it work when I do bar?) ===

Well, we'll try to help. But we're not experts at everything, so don't be surprised if your question about running !FooWeb through [[ModPython|mod_python]] on IRIX goes unanswered. There are times it may be better to seek out a community specific to your framework or toolkit.

Maybe there is also a channel for your framework. Here a list of known support channels on freenode:
 * #django for Django
 * #turbogears for Turbogears
 * #pylons for Pylons
 * #myghty for Myghty
 * #pythonpaste for Paste
 * #pocoo for Werkzeug
 * #zope for Zope 2
 * #zope3-dev for Zope 3
 * #circuits for Circuits
=== Can I bring my IRC bot into the channel? ===
No. We are trying to reduce idlers, and it so happens that bots are worst of idlers. Sorry.
=== My question wasn't covered here. ===

Well, come on in and ask it. We don't bite. Really.
