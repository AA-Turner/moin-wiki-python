I discovered this when my students were creating a fraction class.
7/4 = 1
however
-7/4 = -2
It seems to me the second result should be -1
It appears it is using the floor function but it isn't what my students wanted nor can I think of when anyone would want this result.
Anyone know why?
Thanks for any help

That is what floor division does, it reduces the value to the next lowest whole number.  If you want to separate the whole number and fractional part, use math.modf:
{{{
from __future__ import division
import math
print math.modf(25/12)
--> (0.08333, 2.0)
print math.modf(-25/12)
--> (-0.08333, -2.0)

#to just print the whole number as an int:
print int(math.modf(25/12)[1])
}}}
