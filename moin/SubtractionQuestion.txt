Describe SubtractionQuestion here.
I discovered this when my students were creating a fraction class.
7/4 = 1
however
-7/4 = -2
It seems to me the second result should be -1
Any explanation?
It appears it is using the floor function but it isn't what my students wanted nor can I think of when anyone would want this result.
Thanks for any help
