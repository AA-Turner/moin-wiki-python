This project aims to develop a file format and interactive support for documents which can combine Python code with rich text and embedded graphics.  The initial requirements only aim at being able to edit such documents with a normal programming editor, with final rendering to PDF or HTML being done by calling an external program (to be written by the students).

The editing component would have to be integrated with IPython [http://ipython.scipy.org], so that while not rendered in final hardcopy format, the notebooks can still be used in a truly interactive fashion.

This project would be supported by direct help from the IPython lead developer, just contact him either directly or via the IPython development list [http://scipy.net/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev]

This page [http://ipython.scipy.org/google_soc] contains further details on the project and materials for prospective applicants.

The work for this is starting now, with Google / Summer of Code support - pointer to the project space coming here.
