This project aims to develop a file format and interactive support for documents which can combine Python code with rich text and embedded graphics.  The initial requirements only aim at being able to edit such documents with a normal programming editor, with final rendering to PDF or HTML being done by calling an external program (to be written by the students).

 * Can somebody provide more detail? From the brief description provided this looks like a combination of mail merge and PHP.
