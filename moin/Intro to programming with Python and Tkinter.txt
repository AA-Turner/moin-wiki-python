       The purpose of this project is to provide an user interactive environment for anyone interested in learning python. So far most of the tutorials are in text format. However, when I was learning python, I always wished somebody had taught an online video course. Thanks to ourmedia.org for storing my videos it is now possible to provide this service. 

      So far, I only have 5 lectures posted. More will come as soon as I finish my final exames. The first and second lecture is not recorded yet. They are about the history of python as well as where you can download them. The beginner's series will be about 50 lectures covering the most basic programming ideas. (loops, if/else, functions, files) as well as some fun Tkinter widget manipulation. 

      I am currently looking for volunteers that are willing to teach more advance python lectures. The more advance topics will inclue swig, jython, XML manipulation, etc. If you are interested in volunteering, you can reach me at my ourmedia.org site. http://ourmedia.org/user/4887

You don't need any expansive video equipment to record yourself. If you are using linux, the voice is recorded in Audacity, the screen capture is done in gvidcap, and the movie divx format is done is avidmux2. They are all open source and free to download at sourceforge.net. 


'''Intro to programming with Python n Tkinter'''[[BR]]
Have you ever wanted to know how your application is programmed on the computer. This lecture will show you how easy it is to program.

Aimed at beginner programmers or people that has no programming experience. For you to watch this class, you must have python installed from python.org . Lecture 2 will show you how to install and run python. This lecture assumes that you already have python. 

The python course series is designed to be short, fun, and concise. They are 10 minutes each with fun examples and easy instruction. If you want to learn programming this is the way to go. 


'''Lecture 1: Why is python so cool???'''[[BR]]
In this lecture I will convince you that python will eventually take over the world :).  Actually we will discuss how the class will be conducted and how much fun we are going to have. This will be the last lecture I write.

'''Lecture 2: How to download python'''[[BR]]
I will show you where you download python. If you found this page, chances are that you already know how. I will also talk about different resources to help you program python. 

'''Lecture 3: Your first python program'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/2128 [[BR]]
Like all programming books, we kick off with a quick and simple non-hello world application. [[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' ''importing Tkinter library, create a simple list, create a window, create a listbox, fill a listbox, parents of widgets''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' ["lecture3 example 1"], ["lecture3 example 2"][[BR]][[BR]]

'''Lecture 4: Button are meant to be pushed'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/3093 [[BR]]
When you press a button, your program will say "hi"[[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' ''create a button, create a label, link up a button with specific functions, the concept of functions, indentation of functions, changing the foreground and background of widgets''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' ["lecture4 example 1"], ["lecture4 example 2"], ["lecture4 example 3"], ["lecture4 example 5"][[BR]][[BR]]

'''Lecture 5: Stealing is good in programming'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/3094 [[BR]]
We will program something using other people's code :)[[BR]]
'''Your will learn:'''''How to program large programs, how to borrow other people's code(modules), basic concepts to functions''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' ["lecture5 stacy.py 1"], ["lecture5 chieh.py"][[BR]][[BR]]

'''Lecture 6: How to create anything in Tkinter'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/3105 [[BR]]
The needed text is at http://ourmedia.org/node/6635 [[BR]]
We will learn how to create everything in the Tkinter library, windows, buttons, listbox, entrybox, menus, etc. [[BR]]
'''You will learn:'''''How to create any Tkinter widget, how to make stand alone modules.''

'''Lecture 7: Now let's make them do something''' (10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/4221 [[BR]]
Now that we have learned how to create widgets, we need to tell them to do something. In this lecture we will mainly focus on Entry boxes. We will create an entry box, a button, and a listbox. When we press the button the program will take the name in the entry and put them into the list. [[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' ''insert text into a listbox, get text from Entry box, changing the size of the window, controlling where the window pop up, delete what's inside the entry box, controlling the padding between widgets''


''That's incredible! I don't have any video equipment at home, but I should have some within 2 years.'' -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2005-04-15T20:16:00Z)]]

Instead of making wiki pages named ["lecture3 example 1"] and what not, which is begging for a name clash, how about instead posting the files as attachments?

You can type {{{attachment:foo.txt}}}, and that becomes a text file attachment.

An example: attachment:lecture3example1.txt

Oh i didn't see what you wrote. Yes you are right, I was just looking for how I could do that, I will try to slowly convert them ,,,  thank you very much :)
