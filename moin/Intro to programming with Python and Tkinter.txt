hello ... 


       The purpose of this project is to provide user an interactive environment for anyone interested in learning python. So far most of the tutorials are in text format. However, when I was learning python, I always wished somebody had taught an online video course. Thanks to ourmedia.org for storing my videos it is now possible to provide this service. 


        This effort is also a part of a much larger effort I am starting, The opensource University effort. Actually, I am building a free 3D University where everybody can get together learn take free classes. 

        If you have played world of warcraft, or any other 3d world computer game, you would know what type of 3d world i'm talking about. Its kinda like that except its a school. You would run around and click on teachers instead of monster. And a video would pop out, and "hopefully" teach you something useful. 

 Purpose of Iamar
 
    The problem with education is the lack of effort to make the contents inspiring and fun. For thousands of years, the education system has maintained an image that people can only learn new information through arduous work. When in reality this is not true. We all know that there are people that can recite the name of every star football and basketball player. There are people that memorized the energy damage of every sword in their computer and video game. And these knowledge were not obtained through painful work but for fun. There are probably less names to remember for all the presidents of United State than all the major star sports players. Yet people are able to achieve amazing learning never even considered it painful. That is possible for a very simple fact. People will learn what they "want" to learn. Learning itself only becomes painful when it is forced upon a person.

    Our education system pays very little attention to the psychology of the audience. In this respect, they have much to learn from the entertainment industry. Of course, the entertainment industry makes its money by inspiring people to get engaged, and they have done an amazing job. The point here is that if the entertainment industry has engaged the population to learn an enormous amount of useless information, so can the education system engage the learners to learn useful information. By combining entertainment philosophies, education can turn arduous work into fun exercises. This is possible.

    The Iamar Experiment is but only the beginning of this philosophy.

'''Intro to programming with Python in Tkinter'''[[BR]]
Have you ever wanted to know how your application is programmed on the computer. This lecture will show you how easy it is to program.

Aimed at beginner programmers or people that has no programming experience. For you to watch this class, you must have python installed from python.org . Lecture 2 will show you how to install and run python. This lecture assumes that you already have python. 

The python course series is designed to be short, fun, and concise. They are 10 minutes each with fun examples and easy instruction. If you want to learn programming this is the way to go. 


'''Lecture 1: Why is python so cool???'''[[BR]]
In this lecture I will convince you that python will eventually take over the world :).  Actually we will discuss how the class will be conducted and how much fun we are going to have. This will be the last lecture I write.

'''Lecture 2: How to download python'''[[BR]]
I will show you where you download python. If you found this page, chances are that you already know how. I will also talk about different resources to help you program python. 

'''Lecture 3: Your first python program'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/2128 [[BR]]
Like all programming books, we kick off with a quick and simple non-hello world application. [[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' ''importing Tkinter library, create a simple list, create a window, create a listbox, fill a listbox, parents of widgets''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' ["lecture3 example 1"], ["lecture3 example 2"][[BR]][[BR]]

'''Lecture 4: Button are meant to be pushed'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/3093 [[BR]]
When you press a button, your program will say "hi"[[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' ''create a button, create a label, link up a button with specific functions, the concept of functions, indentation of functions, changing the foreground and background of widgets''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' ["lecture4 example 1"], ["lecture4 example 2"], ["lecture4 example 3"], ["lecture4 example 5"][[BR]][[BR]]

'''Lecture 5: Stealing is good in programming'''(10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/3094 [[BR]]
We will program something using other people's code :)[[BR]]
'''Your will learn:'''''How to program large programs, how to borrow other people's code(modules), basic concepts to functions''[[BR]]

'''Lecture 7: Now let's make them do something''' (10min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/4221 [[BR]]
Now that we have learned how to create widgets, we need to tell them to do something. In this lecture we will mainly focus on Entry boxes. We will create an entry box, a button, and a listbox. When we press the button the program will take the name in the entry and put them into the list. [[BR]]

'''You will learn:''' ''insert text into a listbox, get text from Entry box, changing the size of the window, controlling where the window pop up, delete what's inside the entry box, controlling the padding between widgets''[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' attachment:lecture7_homework.py attachment:lecture7_text.py

'''Lecture 8: Let's make some decisions''' (7min)[[BR]]
http://ourmedia.org/node/9691 [[BR]]
Learn how to use the if statements. Having a program that makes decisions for us will make our life much easier and our programs more powerful. In this program you will decide which girl we should go out with on a friday night and which car we should buy. :)[[BR]]
'''You will learn:''' How to use if statements, examples are provided[[BR]]
'''Example Code''' attachment:lecture8_ifexample.py

''That's incredible! I don't have any video equipment at home, but I should have some within 2 years.'' -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2005-04-15T20:16:00Z)]]

Instead of making wiki pages named ["lecture3 example 1"] and what not, which is begging for a name clash, how about instead posting the files as attachments?

You can type {{{attachment:foo.txt}}}, and that becomes a text file attachment.

An example: attachment:lecture3example1.txt

:) -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2005-04-27T19:29:44Z)]]

really good!

Thanks for putting this information on the web.  I wish that there were more poeple doing this type of thing.

Thank you very, very much. Your tutorial is OUTSTANDING! Thank you for the keeping things very simple.    Keith Sweat

I'm just wondering how much time did it take to make these videos. Anyway I like it. And I like your other stuff at ourmedia too.

Levente Zsíros 

Good question:
Here are the stats
    each video takes about 10 hours of "actual" work, (not counting me day dreaming and thinking about some girl) 

writing script (3 hours)
try to make it coherent ( 1 hour)
try to make it fun ( 2 hours)
reherse script (1 hour)
recording video ( 1 hour)
recording audio ( 1 hour)
sync up video and audio (30 min)
re - edit video (30 min) 

watch video
      if i didn't like the video repeat above
      lecture 4 and 5 repeated 3 times 
      lecture 8 repeated 2 times

   yes, imagine i actually enjoy doing this : )

Question: Chieh would you have a website or email address that people can contact you on? I have a talented friend on dreamweaver8 who '''really''' enjoys learning python and watching your videos. If you are interested he may be able to put togehter a website for you on a domain, and upload all your videos to the website. 
   Reply:  Thank you so much for the offer :)  I think that is a great idea. The currently effort I am working on (the next series of lectures) will try to merge with it when it is done. One thing to note is that uploading videos are heavy on bandwidth, I hope your friend has enough bandwidth for it.
