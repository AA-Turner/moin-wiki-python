       The purpose of this project is to provide an user interactive environment for anyone interested in learning python. So far most of the tutorials are in text format. However, when I was learning python, I always wished somebody had taught an online video course. Thanks to ourmedia.org for storing my videos it is now possible to provide this service. 


      So far, I only have 5 lectures posted. More will come as soon as I finish my final exames. The first and second lecture is not recorded yet. They are about the history of python as well as where you can download them. The beginner's series will be about 50 lectures covering the most basic programming ideas. (loops, if/else, functions, files) as well as some fun Tkinter widget manipulation. 

      I am currently looking for volunteers that are willing to teach more advance python lectures. The more advance topics will inclue swig, jython, XML manipulation, etc. If you are interested in volunteering, you can reach me at my ourmedia.org site. http://ourmedia.org/user/4887
