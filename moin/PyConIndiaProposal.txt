= Proposal for PyCon India =

In the spirit of encouraging Python as a language and as developer community, we are planning to conduct a Python conference in India early this coming September. 
This document is a formal proposal detailing what we wish to achieve, what hurdles we expect to face and how we plan to organise the event. 
It is a also a request to the Python Software Foundation to recognise our effort as an 'official' pycon similar to the one recently held in Chicago.

== Aims ==
The following is a list of things we intend to achieve by this conference (in no particular order)
 * Contributing to the python community as a whole - We intend to make available opportunities for talented programmers to contribute to Python itself and related projects. 
 * Corporate canvassing - We intend to spread information about the language to the corporate world in India so as to encourage use and adoption of the language.
 * Focussing efforts - There are a number of python user groups in India. Some large and some small. This conference will serve as a rallying point for all these groups so that we can work together on something larger than the sum of the parts. 
 * Local event of a global scale - It's not always feasible or possible for working class Indian programmers to attend conferences which are held abroad. A large scale conference like this will offer opportunities for such people to get exposure to world class programmers and personalities.
