I am fairly new to Python but I have been teaching Programming for 20+ years, in the classroom and some online.  This will be my first PyCon and Sprints.

I am interested in Python as a first language in a broad introduction to Computing (5 weeks of a 15 week course) at the College level.

I am also interested in Python in web services - homework submission, grading support (NOT assuming anything totally automated -- comments are important!).

An an intro to Python I wrote a little Gallery program, wheich I hope to improve before the conference:  http://www.cs.luc.edu/~anh/gallery
