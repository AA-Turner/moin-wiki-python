This page should list possible extensions to the DbApi3. Because many of those are suggested again and again on the mailing list, this is the place to summarize the discussions. 

 '' Such a discussion already happens on DbApi3, and if it should be on a separate page, that should be a subpage thereof (DbApi3/DisCourse). ''

It also allows driver authors to state whether something similar is already imlemented, is possible to implement or isn't supported by the underlying database or API.

I'd like to see the new DBAPI use Iterators throught... also it'd be
nice if it allowed for non-blocking queries.
