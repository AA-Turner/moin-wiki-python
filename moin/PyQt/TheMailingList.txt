== The PyQt Mailing List ==

The [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/mailman/listinfo/pyqt|mailing list]] provides support for sip, PyQt, PyKDE and eric. And sometimes, it's even funny to read.<<BR>>
Archives are at [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/]] or use [[http://www.google.com|Google]] to search.

== People on the mailing list ==

Add your names here, along with shameless self-glorification
Even better, create your own personal pages!

== Recent topics and digested threads ==

    * [[PyQt/Modular_PyQt_deployment_with_PyInstaller|Modular PyQt deployment with PyInstaller]]
    * [[PyQt/CreatingMdiApplications|CreatingMdiApplications]]

I think we should introduce a bounty for everybody who summarizes a thread here. Any ideas?

Some threads resulted in [[PyQt/SampleCode|SampleCode]] or [[PyQt/Overviews_and_Guides|Overviews_and_Guides]] being written.

== History ==

The mailing list was originally run by Thorsten Horstmann. In March 2007, Riverbank Computing [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2007-March/015689.html|took over administration of the list]].
