= Five minute steps in a QTimeEdit =

On the `#pyqt` channel on Freenode, `rowinggolfer` asked if it was possible to make QTimeEdit step in five minute intervals.

The following subclass reimplements the `stepBy()` method and calls the base class implementation with an adjusted number of steps.

{{{
#!python
class FiveMinuteTimeEdit(QTimeEdit):
  def stepBy(self, steps):
    if self.currentSection() == self.MinuteSection:
      QTimeEdit.stepBy(self, steps * 5)
    else:
      QTimeEdit.stepBy(self, steps)
}}}
