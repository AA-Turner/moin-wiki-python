= Adding items to a list widget =

On the `#pyqt` channel at Freenode, `afief` asked for an example that showed how to add items to a list widget using QListWidgetItem rather than just plain strings.

{{{
#!python
import sys
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

app = QApplication(sys.argv)

listWidget = QListWidget()

for i in range(10):
    item = QListWidgetItem("Item %i" % i)
    listWidget.addItem(item)

listWidget.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
}}}

Although this example seems easy, there is one subtle point worth noting: the list widget takes ownership of each of the items added to it. This means that you cannot add an item to more than one list widget.
