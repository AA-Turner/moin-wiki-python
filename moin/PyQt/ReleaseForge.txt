!ReleaseForge is a GUI application designed for project administrators and release engineers of projects that are hosted at !SourceForge. It is intended to make it easier and faster to create a new release and edit existing releases rather than using the !SourceForge Web interface.

!ReleaseForge streamlines the release effort by prompting you for information regarding your new release (version info, change log, release notes, files to include, etc). It then seamlessly negotiates with the !SourceForge Web server, creating your release, posting your release notes/change log, uploading your files to the !SourceForge FTP server, selecting the files for inclusion in your release on the !SourceForge Web server, updating the file attributes of each of the files and then, if appropriate, notifying monitoring users of the new release.

!ReleaseForge is an open source project released under the GNU Public License (GPL).
