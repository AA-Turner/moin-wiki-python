= GUI Testing =

The following list is a collection of resources that may be useful to people who want to test their user interfaces:

 * [[http://www.voom.net/pyqt-qtest-example/|How to write unit tests for PyQt GUI widgets]] using only the open source modules included in PyQt and Python
 * [[http://www.froglogic.com/|Squish]]
 * [[http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2009-June/002024.html|PyQt testing with nose]] - a thread from the python-testing mailing list which describes various options
   * [[http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/|LDTP]] uses accessibility libraries to perform GUI testing
     * Due to the conflicting libraries in use on Linux desktops (ATK vs. D-Bus) and the fact that D-Bus-based accessibility is often disabled for Qt applications, this may not be a workable option.
 * [[http://gitorious.org/hooq/hooq|Hooq]] (see this [[http://www.fredemmott.co.uk/blog/2010/01/18/Qt4 GUI Testing with Hooq|blog article]])
  * Another [[http://shiqiyang.com/blog/?p=195|blog article]] about using Hooq with !PyQt4
 * [[http://www.pyzine.com/Issue007/Section_Articles/article_PyGUIUnittest.html|PyGUIUnitTest: A GUI Testing Framework]]

The [[PyQt/Unit_Testing|Unit Testing]] page deals with more general unit testing issues.
