This tutorial assumes that you have [[http://twistedmatrix.com|twisted]] with [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php|pyqt4]] installed and working.


The first thing you will need is the [[http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/1770/qt4reactor.py|qt4reactor]], which you can find on twisted's trac server.

<notes: next step, do you need to install it before you can call it?  How you do that, I'm not sure.>
