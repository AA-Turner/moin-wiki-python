= MPlayerWidget =

MPlayerWidget is a widget wrapper around MPlayer. Unlike other solutions that use the XEmbed protocol to embed an MPlayer window in a user interface, this solution passes the X handle of an existing QLabel widget to MPlayer so that it can render its output directly onto it.

Henning Schr√∂der posted a link to his !PyQt (Qt 3) MPlayer wrapper widget in [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2007-June/016277.html|a message]] to [[PyQt/TheMailingList|the mailing list]]. He has kindly donated the code to the community, and it can also be obtained from this page.
