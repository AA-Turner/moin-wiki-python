= Multimedia Resources =

There seem to be a few cross-platform resources for playing video and decoding movies, some of which are available in Python. It might be worthwhile trying to create wrappers for some of
the more interesting projects.

== Non-Python Resources ==

The [[http://avifile.sourceforge.net/|avifile]] project provides a Qt 3-based player on Linux, and would seem to be a reasonable candidate for a PyQt wrapper. However, there doesn't seem to be much documentation for it outside the header files, but it might be possible to create a reasonably high-level wrapper using SIP, and at least we know it will work with Qt's event loop.

[[http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/|FFmpeg]] provides a set of tools and libraries that could be used to play and manipulate video.

== Python Resources ==

 * [[http://pymedia.org/|PyMedia]] is a Python package that supports various audio and video formats.
 * In [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2009-September/024240.html|a message]] to [[PyQt/TheMailingList|the PyQt mailing list]], Baz Walter gives an example of using GStreamer bindings for Python with !PyQt (see [[PyQt/Using GStreamer with PyQt|Using GStreamer with PyQt]]).

== Out of Process Wrappers ==

Henning Schr√∂der posted a link to his !PyQt (Qt 3) MPlayer wrapper widget in [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2007-June/016277.html|a message]] to [[TheMailingList|the mailing list]]. He has kindly donated the code to the community, and it can also be obtained from the [[PyQt/Multimedia_Resources/MPlayerWidget|MPlayerWidget]] page.
