Python has a standard [[http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html|logging]] module modeled after Log4j (http://logging.apache.org/log4j) - the standard logging system for Java. Here we gather additional information about logging in Python in general that is missing from the docs.

 * LoggingPackage page contains discussions about `logging` module features.
 * There seems to be another log4j port to Python http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4py/ (not sure how far it is from standard package - anybody want to explore and post results here?)
