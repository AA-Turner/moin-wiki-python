= Python Projects =
As a programming language, Python is the foundation of many software projects producing things like applications, libraries, modules and packages. Since so many projects exist, it can be difficult to find one which is concentrating on a particular topic of interest, but there are several starting points:

 * [[Applications]] - a list of Python-based applications
 * UsefulModules - libraries, modules and packages
 * PublishingPythonModules - places where modules are often publicised
 * PythonMed - Python Med (along the lines of [[http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed|DebianMed]]) presents packages that are associated with medicine, pre-clinical research, life science and bio-informatics.
 * [[http://www.sourceforge.net/|SourceForge]] hosts open source Python-based software projects:
  * Browse for projects written in [[https://sourceforge.net/directory/language:python/|Python]]
 * [[http://pythonsource.com|Python Source]] is a directory of open source python projects.
 * [[http://packageupdates.org/language/python/|Packageupdates.org]] lists "top" and "hot" Python packages. The site can also send email notifications for package updates.
 * [[http://pydoc.net/|PyDoc.net]] provides package and source code navigation with advanced search features.

== Code Fragments ==
Useful code does not always exist in the context of a project - smaller fragments may be published in various places:

 * [[Code]] - a list of small code fragments
 * [[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/|The Python Cookbook]] - a site with pieces of code, rated and commented

== Ideas for New Projects ==
Sometimes there is no project addressing a certain need, or perhaps a project has been started and requires help to reach its objectives.

 * CodingProjectIdeas - a list of ideas for projects of various sizes
 * [[http://pythonpracticeprojects.com|Python Practice Projects]] - Collection of larger project ideas with references to get you started.

== Statistics on Projects ==
For those who like statistics, some resources exist cataloguing the size and popularity of some Python projects:

 * LargePythonProjects
 * MostPopularPythonProjects
