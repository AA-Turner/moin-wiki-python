"distutils" is by now the standard mechanism to distribute Python packages and extensions, and appeared in Python 1.6. It runs under 1.5.2 though, but you have to install it (once) to use it for that Python version.

Projects:
 * DistutilsProjects - please add a listing to this page if you're working on Distutils (and help us reduce duplication of effort)

DistUtilsExtensions is a repository of extensions for your "setup.py".
