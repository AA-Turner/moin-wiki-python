"distutils" is by now the standard mechanism to distribute Python packages and extensions, and appeared in Python 1.6. It runs under 1.5.2 though, but you have to install it (once) to use it for that Python version.

'''Q.''' ''Can you use distutils (i.e., your setup.py file) to '''un'''install a given package?''

'''A.''' Unfortunately, no. This would be a useful feature to have though... However, the KDE group has written a [http://www.simonzone.com/software/pykdeextensions/en/distutils-uninstall.html wrapper] for distutils that adds a simple uninstall command.
