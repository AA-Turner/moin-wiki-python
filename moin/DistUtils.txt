== Distutils ==

Distutils is by now the standard mechanism to distribute Python packages and extensions, and appeared in Python 1.6. It runs under 1.5.2 though, but you have to install it (once) to use it for that Python version.


=== Pycon work ===

 * [[DistutilsVersionFight]] : the goal is to come up with a proposal in distutils-SIG 
 * [[Distutils/StandardizeEggInfo]] : the goal is to finalize PEP 376
 * [[Distutils/Metadata]] : the goal is to finalize PEP 345
 * [[Distutils/StaticMetadata]] : the goal is to come out with a proposal to split setup.py into a static metadata file + a lighter,
 almost empty script.
 * [[Distutils/Friends]] : the goal is to try to find a project, a person or a group of person on each platform that is willing 
 to maintain a third-party tool that build system-specific distros out of python package.
 * [[Distutils/ManifestPluginSystem]] : a plugin system to build the MANIFEST file
 * [[Distutils/ManifestPluginSystem/Draft]] : Plugin system draft
 * [[Distutils/TestingInfrastructure]] : Testing infrastructure
