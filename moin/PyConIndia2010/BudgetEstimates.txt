These are approximate costs of various items along with notes. This assumes a 2 day conference. These are over estimates representing the upper bounds rather than minimums. All costs in INR


== Venue (20000) ==
 * Assuming a large venue like the JN Tata auditorium (or someplace similar in Chennai), this is roughly what the cost will be.
 * *The venue will be MSRIT which will have only nominal costs associated with it. I've put in 20k just as a placeholder*.

== Foreign delegates (100000) ==
 * I have spoken to two people in at PyCon Atlanta 2010 who are open to travelling if we can cover air fare/accommodation. I approximate a 70k two way air ticket and around 15k for a 2 day stay/commute at a decent hotel. This comes to approximately 2L
 * Comments: This costs 25% of the budget estimates. Do we know for sure if these two speakers will pull in the crowds and increase attendees beyond the budgeted 500 people?
 * '''AnandBPillai''': We can get PSF to fund some part of the travel. This reduces the expenses. We should budget for 1 key speaker who can be the keynote speaker and preferably a core Python-dev team member who can talk about Python core development and will surely pull in the crowd. Hopefully PSF will fund the air travel for this person, at least one way.
 * '''NoufalIbrahim''' : +1 for just one delegate. +1 for PSF funding if possible. I'm neutral about the person as long as it's someone notable. 
      

== Professional wifi (35000) ==
 *  I'm pulling this number out of thin air. Around 35k for 2 days of professional recording?
 * Wifi (20000)
    We can contact someone like AirTel or others to sponsor wifi. I'm not sure about costs here. If we have to do it manually, I think we can cover it in around 20k (wild guesstimate).
 * Barter sponsorship :: At pycon, there was one hall with folks selling wares, swag, books, etc... during the conference. I am not sure how this would tie-in with the venue or if it is permitted at all. If yes, we can try asking AirTel to provide wifi in exchange for a booth selling pre-paid cards or talktime?

== Food (100000) ==
  *  We'll balance food+swag with the registration fees like last time and cover it. I think 200-250INR per head should be fine. We can charge slightly higher than that as registration fees and it should be okay. Assuming 500 people, this comes to around 1L


== Registration fee ==
 * Keep 3-tiers slab rates. One: for students (200-250INR per head). Two: for speakers and project contributors (500 per head) and Third, for delegates sponsored by corporates (3 people for INR1000? plus a sponsorship package which can cost extra (TBD)).

  * '''AnandBPillai''': Way too complex. How to determine "students" is a problem. I suggest just keeping it at two tier for "normal" participants and corporate delegates. Normal can be 200-300 INR and corporate maybe 500 per head.
  * '''NoufalIbrahim''' : +1. Two tiers is more than enough. There would also have to be a few free tickets with every sponsorship package but that's best discussed on the Sponsorship pages.

== Miscellaneous (10000) ==
  *  Posters, flyers, sponsorship brochures etc. Some of this money is needed upfront and we have to rely on the 1L we've saved from last time but we have to cover costs. We need nice stuff if we have to talk to people. Let's budget 50k for this.

   
== '''Total''' : 165000 INR (1.65 Lakhs) ==
