These are approximate costs of various items along with notes. This assumes a 2 day conference. These are over estimates representing the upper bounds rather than minimums. All costs in INR

== Venue (75000 INR * 2 days = 150000) ==
 * Assuming a large venue like the JN Tata auditorium (or someplace similar in Chennai), this is roughly what the cost will be. 

== Foreign delegates (200000) ==
 * I have spoken to two people in at PyCon Atlanta 2010 who are open to travelling if we can cover air fare/accommodation. I approximate a 70k two way air ticket and around 15k for a 2 day stay/commute at a decent hotel. This comes to approximately 2L
 * Comments: This costs 25% of the budget estimates. Do we know for sure if these two speakers will pull in the crowds and increase attendees beyond the budgeted 500 people?

== Professional wifi (35000) ==
 *  I'm pulling this number out of thin air. Around 35k for 2 days of professional recording?
 * Wifi (20000)
    We can contact someone like AirTel or others to sponsor wifi. I'm not sure about costs here. If we have to do it manually, I think we can cover it in around 20k (wild guesstimate).
 * Barter sponsorship :: At pycon, there was one hall with folks selling wares, swag, books, etc... during the conference. I am not sure how this would tie-in with the venue or if it is permitted at all. If yes, we can try asking AirTel to provide wifi in exchange for a booth selling pre-paid cards or talktime?

== Food (100000) ==
  *  We'll balance food+swag with the registration fees like last time and cover it. I think 200-250INR per head should be fine. We can charge slightly higher than that as registration fees and it should be okay. Assuming 500 people, this comes to around 1L


== Registration fee ==
 * Keep 3-tiers slab rates. One: for students (200-250INR per head). Two: for speakers and project contributors (500 per head) and Third, for delegates sponsored by corporates (3 people for INR1000? plus a sponsorship package which can cost extra (TBD)).

== Sponsors ==
 * Offer corporates various packages for sponsoring the event. It
could be slab rates for "advertising/swag+booths", or "booths for
recruitment+talks". Companies sending employees to showcase their work
could be charged delegate fees+talk slots besides sponsorship.


== Miscellaneous (10000) ==
  *  Posters, flyers, sponsorship brochures etc. Some of this money is needed upfront and we have to rely on the 1L we've saved from last time but we have to cover costs. We need nice stuff if we have to talk to people. Let's budget 50k for this.

== Financial aid for remote people? ==
    Let's keep this aside for now. 
 

== '''Total''' : 515000 INR (5.15 Lakhs) ==
