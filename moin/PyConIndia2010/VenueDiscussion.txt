== Bangalore ==
The poll had around 100 people voting with around 64 percent for Bangalor and 36 for Chennai.

=== Pros ===
 *  Held it there last year. Twice in the same city rule useful for remote delegates.
   * It also helps to learn from past mistakes and smooth out any rough edges in the second year. Larger volunteer traction can be generated. 
 *  Larger number of small sponsors in Bangalore (is this really true?)
 *  More convenient climate and location for delegates from the North .
 *  If held twice in a row, its easier to negotiate contracts with vendors on the basis of repeat business. 
 *  Bangalore weather is nicer and the initial.
 *  The Poll results are in favour of Bangalore

=== Cons ===
 * Accommodation, Auditorium and Food are expensive. 

== Chennai ==

=== Pros ===
 * High amount of enthusiasm shown by ChennaiPy and some ground work already done. 
 * Good student participation from Chennai last year.
 * Change in PyCon location would create awareness about Python in Chennai and would be helpful for college students.
 * Kausik has met people at the recent Barcamp which indicates enough volunteers for ground work.

=== Cons ===
 * humid climate
  * Decent climate in September/October.
 * Farther away from the North
  * People will be taking flights anyway. If it's train, it's just a few hours more than Bangalore
