== Bangalore ==

=== Pros ===
 *  Held it there last year. Twice in the same city rule useful for remote delegates.
 *  Larger team of people in Bangalore (BangPypers is more active than ChennaiPy).
 *  Larger number of small sponsors in Bangalore (is this really true?)
 *  More convenient climate and location for delegates from the North .
 *  The 2 cities in a row model followed by US.pycon has many advantages-- it helps to learn from past mistakes and smooth out any rough edges in the second year. Larger volunteer traction can be generated. 
 *  If held twice in a row, its easier to negotiate contracts with vendors on the basis of repeat business. 
 *  Bangalore weather is nicer and the initial enthusiasm from the Chennai team has slowed as September draws closer :/

=== Cons ===
 

== Chennai ==
=== Pros ===
 * High amount of enthusiasm shown by ChennaiPy and some ground work already done. 
 * Good student participation from Chennai last year.

=== Cons ===
 * humid climate
