== Expectations ==
Judging is based on the following fields (in decreasing order of importance) - Summary, Outline, Author Bio.


== Evaluation process ==
 * Each proposal is evaluated on the following 6 points on a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being bad and 5 being good (except when otherwise mentioned).
 * We will then collate the scores and decide on which talks are accepted and which are not. 
 * The criteria are 
  2. Clarity of the proposal (summary field)
  2. Clarity of the talk details (Outline)
  2. Bio of authors (reputation, contributions etc.)
  2. Novelty of the topic (0 for a dead topic, 5 for a novel one).
  2. Competing talks (0 if no competing talks, 1 if any - indicate talk number if it's there).
  2. Overall rating (Consider mainly 1, 2 and 5 for this)
