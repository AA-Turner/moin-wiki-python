= Pycon India 2010 – Call for Proposals =

PyCon India is the first and only conference of its kind organized in India for Python programming language enthusiasts from all over the country. PyCon India is being held in Bangalore, India for the 2nd time from Sep 25-26 2010 at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.

Pycon India 2010 organizers are looking for talk proposals to fill the formal presentation tracks. We accept proposals related to a very broad range of topics related to Python programming.

You might be a software developer who has written or worked in an interesting Python project, a young programmer just out of college exploring Python, or an academic who wants to discuss how he used Python to solve problems in a research project, or a hobbyist who has explored different Python packaging options – in short anyone who is passionate about Python and has spend some time on it. As long as the proposal is interesting and has something potentially useful for the Python community, we will consider it for inclusion in the conference.

Please follow the instructions below carefully before preparing a proposal and submitting it.

The typical length of a talk should be no more than 45 minutes. The presentation style should be concise, to the point with sufficient examples to clarify the discussion to the audience, if needed.

You can also opt for a talk which is 30 minutes long. Such talks should typically discuss how to do a certain thing related to Python in a concise way.

The talk length includes the time for audience interaction implicitly. You should prepare your talks so as to leave at least 5 mins room at the end for taking audience questions.
