[Should I cut up my Advocacy HOWTO (http://py-howto.sourceforge.net/advocacy/advocacy.html)
into a set of Wiki pages? --amk]

 Why not just link to it from here, and provide an abstract so people can decide if they want to click? If you want to collect comments on it, refer to a AdvocacyHowtoDiscussion page. -- JÃ¼rgenHermann [[DateTime(2002-07-14T09:15:42)]]

[Done.  Following Wiki etiquette, should I delete these discussion notes now? --amk]
