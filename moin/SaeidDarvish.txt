I began my professional programming journey with Python in 2015 and quickly fell in love with the power and versatility of the language. Since then, I have expanded my skills to become proficient in Java and have gained extensive experience developing microservices with the Spring framework.

I've also published an open-source book on Python (In Persian), which has helped me deepen my understanding and share my knowledge with others. Overall, I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industryâ€‹.
