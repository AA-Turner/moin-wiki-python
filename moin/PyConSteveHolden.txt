PyConSteveHolden is the name of the PyCon page for SteveHolden. Not very clever, really, but useful enough to devote Wiki space to. Who reads these things, anyway, right?

== Network Infrastructure ==

Here's how I described PyCon to the Cafritz Center contact Meghan Steed: ''

  I don't imagine we're a rabidly unusual audience for a venue like yours, though perhaps tending a bit towards geek. :-)

  Most networking would be internal, I imagine, and apart from email most would only want sporadic web access. While I could have volunteers donate or loan 100 MHz Ethernet infrastructure, I wondered whether to ask Aron to negotiate terms for a few nice "Network Infrastructure ..." pieces of signage in for the week in return for a few well-placed 16- or 24-port switches or hubs. I believe we still have gaps in our marketing program.
''

If this is drastically below what you [''yes, this means you, hello?...''] '''personally''' require, please feel free to share any additional infrastructure you may have available. Or at least let me know.

I plan to entitle my Introductory remarks ''Because It Works''.


''SteveHolden''
