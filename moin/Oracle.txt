==== Extensions to DB API ====

==== Comments ====

While trying to install the cx_Oracle Python utility, I encounter the following error:

 

sh-2.05b# python setup.py build

running build

running build_ext

building 'cx_Oracle' extension

gcc -pthread -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/devtools/oracle/product/8.1.5/rdbms/demo -I/devtools/oracle/product/8.1.5/rdbms/public -I/devtools/oracle/product/8.1.5/network/public -I/usr/local/python2.4/include/python2.4 -c cx_Oracle.c -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.4/cx_Oracle.o -DBUILD_TIME="January 21, 2005 11:19:47"

cx_Oracle.c:10: xa.h: No such file or directory

error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

 

Where can I find the xa.h file?  The only package I could find online that provides any such file is a cd i/o library, and that doesn’t seem right.

I am running a 2.4 linux kernel, trying to install cx_Oracle-4.0.1 on top of Python 2.4.

I have tried the beta package which should be more 2.4 compatible, but still no luck.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!

'''Answer''':


I got the same problem. Installing package "python2.4-dev" worked for me.


''apt-get install python2.4-dev''

==== Programming Model ====

==== Comments ====

== Supported Python Applications ==

 * ["Zope"]
 * an Oracle (DCOracle and DCOracle2) driver exists for ["PyDO"] (Python Data Objects)

== Pros ==

== Cons ==
 * Requires bloated Oracle client installation on any machine that the app will run on
