I plan on making sure that enough detail is covered so that anyone attending the tutorial will be able to read the [http://www.python.org/dev/summary/ python-dev Summaries] with no problems in regards to the [http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html reST] syntax.  As I start writing my HTML slides (which I will most likely link from here as a work on them) I will go over what I am covering here so people can make requests of what they want covered at the conference.  -- BC
