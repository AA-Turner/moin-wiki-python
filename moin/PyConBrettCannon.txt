I plan on making sure that enough detail is covered so that anyone attending the tutorial will be able to read the [[http://www.python.org/dev/summary/|python-dev Summaries]] with no problems in regards to the [[http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html|reST]] syntax.

The slides (in some form or another) can be found at http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bac/rest_tutorial.html
