= Beginner's Guide to Python =

New to programming? Python is free, and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.

== New to Python? ==

Read ["BeginnersGuide/Overview"] for a short explanation of what Python is.

== Getting Python ==

Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer.
This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their
instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming.

See ["BeginnersGuide/Download"] for instructions
for downloading the correct version of Python.

At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.

== Learning Python ==

Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

      * If you've never programmed before, see ["BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers"] for a list of suitable tutorials.
      * If you have previous programming experience, consult ["BeginnersGuide/Programmers"], which lists more advanced tutorials.
      * If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's [http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html list of Non-English resources].

Most tutorials assume you know how to run a program on your computer.
If you are using Windows and need help with this, see [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows How do I Run a Program Under Windows].

Once you've read a tutorial, you can browse through
[http://docs.python.org Python's online documentation].
It includes [http://docs.python.org/tut/ a tutorial]
that may be helpful, [http://docs.python.org//lib/ a Library Reference] that lists all of the modules that come
standard with Python, and [http://docs.python.org/ref/ the Language Reference] for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.

When you are ready to write your first program you will need a text
editor. To get started you can use any editor you are familiar with - even something like Notepad - but as you gain experience you may want to use a text editor with features that help you write Python programs. See PythonEditors for a list of programs friendly to Python code editing.

== Need Help? ==

Need help with any of this? Read ["BeginnersGuide/Help"] for mailing lists and newsgroups.

Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see IntroductoryBooks for suggested titles.

Consult ["BeginnersGuide/Examples"] for small
programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.

Or, you can pay for a Python course; see ["BeginnersGuide/Courses"] for a list.

Teachers can join the [http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/ EDU-SIG], a mailing list for discussion of Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to university.

== Looking for a particular Python module or application? ==

 * The first place to look is the Python Package Index, now appropriately renamed [http://cheeseshop.python.org the Cheese Shop].

 * If you can't find anything relevant in the Package Index,
 try [http://www.python.org/search/ searching python.org] - you can
 find anything mentioned on the Python site, in the [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/ FAQs], or in the
 newsgroup. More info: [http://www.python.org/search/#help where to
 search].

 * Next, try [http://www.google.com Google] or other
 search engine of your choice. Searching for "python" and some relevant keywords will usually find something helpful.

 * Finally, you can try posting a query to the comp.lang.python Usenet group.



== Want to contribute? ==

 * Python is a product of the [http://www.python.org/psf/ Python Software Foundation], a non-profit organization that holds the copyright. [http://www.python.org/psf/donations.html Donations to the PSF] are tax-deductible in the USA, and you can donate via credit card or PayPal.

 * To report a bug in the Python core, use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 Python Bug Tracker] at SourceForge.

 * To contribute a bug fix or other patch to the Python
 core, read the [http://www.python.org/dev/ Python Developer's Guide]
 for more information about Python's development process.

 * To contribute to the official [http://www.python.org/doc/ Python documentation], join the [http://www.python.org/sigs/doc-sig/ Documentation SIG],
 write to docs@python.org, or use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=305470 Patch Manager] to contribute a documentation patch.

 * To announce your module or application to the Python community,
 use [news:comp.lang.python.announce comp.lang.python.announce]. See [http://www.python.org/community/lists.html#comp-lang-python-announce the guide to Python mailing lists] for more information.

 * To propose changes to the python core, post your thoughts to [news:comp.lang.python comp.lang.python].
 If you have an implementation, follow the [http://www.python.org/patches/ Python Patch Guidelines].
