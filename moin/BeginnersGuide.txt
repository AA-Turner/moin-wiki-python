== Beginner's Guide to catching Pythons ==

New to programming?  Python is free, and easy to learn if you know where to start!  This guide will help you to get started quickly.

'''New to Python?'''

  *  Read ["BeginnersGuide/Overview"] to learn the key points.
  *  First, you need to get the Python interpreter installed on your computer.
  (This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their
  instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming.)
  See ["BeginnersGuide/Download"] for instructions
  for downloading the correct version of Python.

  *  You'll want to select a [http://www.python.org/moin/PythonEditors text editor] that has support for Python.

  * Need to know how to run programs? See [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows How do I Run a Program Under Windows] (Unix/Linux users are assumed, perhaps incorrectly, to be familiar with the necessary techniques).

  *  Next, you're going to want to read a tutorial and try some simple experiments
  with your new Python interpreter.

      *  If you've never programmed before, see ["BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers"].
      *  If you have previous programming experience, consult  ["BeginnersGuide/Programmers"], which lists more advanced tutorials.
      *  Free Python video lectures are also available ["Intro to programming with Python and Tkinter"], though they're only viewable on Windows. Requires a DivX player, available from http://www.divx.com/divx/windows/. 
      *  If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language.  Consult python.org's [http://www.python.org/doc/NonEnglish.html list of Non-English resources].


  *  Once you've read a tutorial, you can browse through
  [http://www.python.org/doc/ Python's online documentation].
  It includes [http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/ a tutorial]
  that may be helpful, [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/ a Library Reference] that lists all of the modules that come
  standard with Python, and [http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/ the Language Reference] for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.

  *  Most Python books will include an introduction; see IntroductoryBooks
  for suggested titles.
  *  Consult ["BeginnersGuide/Examples"] for small
  programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.
  *  Need help from a human?  Read ["BeginnersGuide/Help"] for mailing lists and newsgroups.
  *  Or, you can pay for a Python course; see ["BeginnersGuide/Courses"] for a list.
  *  Teachers can join the [http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/ EDU-SIG],
  a mailing list for discussion of
  Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to
  university.

== Looking for a particular Python module or application? ==

 *  The first place to look is the [http://www.python.org/pypi/ Python Package Index].

 * If you can't find anything relevant in the Package Index,
 try [http://www.python.org/search/ searching python.org] - you can
 find anything mentioned on the Python site, in the [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/ FAQs], or in the
 newsgroup.  More info: [http://www.python.org/search/#help where to
 search].

 * Next, try [http://www.google.com Google] or other
 search engine of your choice.  Searching for "python" and some relevant keywords will usually find something helpful.

 * Finally, you can try posting a query to the comp.lang.python Usenet group.



== Want to contribute? ==

 *  Python is a product of the [http://www.python.org/psf/ Python Software Foundation], a non-profit organization that holds the copyright. [http://www.python.org/psf/donations.html Donations to the PSF] are tax-deductible in the USA, and you can donate via credit card or PayPal.

 * To report a bug in the Python core, use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 Python Bug Tracker] at SourceForge.

 * To contribute a bug fix or other patch to the Python
 core, read the [http://www.python.org/dev/ Python Developer's Guide]
 for more information about Python's development process.

 * To contribute to the official [http://www.python.org/doc/ Python documentation], join the [http://www.python.org/sigs/doc-sig/ Documentation SIG], 
 write to docs@python.org, or use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=305470 Patch Manager] to contribute a documentation patch.

 *  To announce your module or application to the Python community,
 use [news:comp.lang.python.announce comp.lang.python.announce].  See [http://www.python.org/community/lists.html#comp-lang-python-announce the guide to Python mailing lists] for more information.

 *  To propose changes to the python core, post your thoughts to [news:comp.lang.python comp.lang.python].
 If you have an implementation, follow the [http://www.python.org/patches/ Python Patch Guidelines].
