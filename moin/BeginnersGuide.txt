= Beginner's Guide to Python =

New to programming? Python is free, and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.

== New to Python? ==

Read [[BeginnersGuide/Overview]] for a short explanation of what Python is.

== Getting Python ==

Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer.
This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their
instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming.

See [[BeginnersGuide/Download]] for instructions
for downloading the correct version of Python.

At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.

== Learning Python ==

Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

      * If you've never programmed before, see [[BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers]] for a list of suitable tutorials.
      * If you have previous programming experience, consult [[BeginnersGuide/Programmers]], which lists more advanced tutorials.
      * If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/Languages|list of Non-English resources]].

Most tutorials assume you know how to run a program on your computer.
If you are using Windows and need help with this, see [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows|How do I Run a Program Under Windows]].

Once you've read a tutorial, you can browse through
[[http://docs.python.org|Python's online documentation]].
It includes [[http://docs.python.org/tut/|a tutorial]]
that may be helpful, [[http://docs.python.org//lib/|a Library Reference]] that lists all of the modules that come
standard with Python, and [[http://docs.python.org/ref/|the Language Reference]] for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.

When you are ready to write your first program you will need a text
editor. To get started you can use any editor you are familiar with - even something like Notepad - but as you gain experience you may want to use a text editor with features that help you write Python programs. See PythonEditors for a list of programs friendly to Python code editing.

== Need Help? ==

Need help with any of this? Read [[BeginnersGuide/Help]] for mailing lists and newsgroups.

Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see IntroductoryBooks for suggested titles.

Consult [[BeginnersGuide/Examples]] for small
programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.

Or, you can pay for a Python course; see [[BeginnersGuide/Courses]] for a list.

Teachers can join the [[http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/|EDU-SIG]], a mailing list for discussion of Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to university.

== Looking for a particular Python module or application? ==

 * The first place to look is the [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi|Python Package Index]].

 * If you can't find anything relevant in the Package Index,
 try [[http://www.python.org/search/|searching python.org]] - you can
 find anything mentioned on the Python site, in the [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/|FAQs]], or in the
 newsgroup. More info: [[http://www.python.org/search/|where to search]].

 * Next, try [[http://www.google.com|Google]] or other
 search engine of your choice. Searching for "python" and some relevant keywords will usually find something helpful.

 * Finally, you can try posting a query to the comp.lang.python Usenet group.



== Want to contribute? ==

 * Python is a product of the [[http://www.python.org/psf/|Python Software Foundation]], a non-profit organization that holds the copyright. [[http://www.python.org/psf/donations/|Donations to the PSF]] are tax-deductible in the USA, and you can donate via credit card or PayPal.

 * To report a bug in the Python core, use the [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470|Python Bug Tracker]] at SourceForge.

 * To contribute a bug fix or other patch to the Python core, read the [[http://www.python.org/dev/|Python Developer's Guide]] for more information about Python's development process.

 * To contribute to the official [[http://www.python.org/doc/|Python documentation]], join the [[http://www.python.org/sigs/doc-sig/|Documentation SIG]], write to docs@python.org, or use the [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=305470|Patch Manager]] to contribute a documentation patch.

 * To announce your module or application to the Python community, use [[news:comp.lang.python.announce|comp.lang.python.announce]]. See [[http://www.python.org/community/lists/#comp-lang-python-announce|the guide to Python mailing lists]] for more information.

 * To propose changes to the python core, post your thoughts to [[news:comp.lang.python|comp.lang.python]]. If you have an implementation, follow the [[http://www.python.org/patches/|Python Patch Guidelines]].
