= Beginner's Guide to Python =
New to programming? Python is free and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.

[[BeginnersGuideChinese|Chinese Translation/中文版入门]]

== New to Python? ==
Read [[BeginnersGuide/Overview]] for a short explanation of what Python is.

== Getting Python ==
Next, install the Python 3 interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac and Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3). See [[BeginnersGuide/Download]] for instructions to download the correct version of Python.

There are also Python interpreter and IDE bundles available, such as [[http://thonny.org|Thonny]]. Other options can be found at IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments.

At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.

== Learning Python ==
Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

 * If you have never programmed before, see BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers for a list of suitable tutorials.
 * If you have previous programming experience, consult [[BeginnersGuide/Programmers]], which lists more advanced tutorials.
 * If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's [[Languages|list of Non-English resources]].

Most tutorials assume that you know how to run a program on your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, see [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows|How do I Run a Program Under Windows]].

Some sites offer in-browser coding for those who want to learn Python:

 * [[https://www.codedex.io|Codédex]]

 * [[https://www.coding-bootcamps.com|Coding Bootcamps]]

 * [[https://www.datacamp.com|DataCamp]]

 * [[https://www.dataquest.io|Dataquest]] for Python for data science.

 * [[https://www.hackinscience.org|HackInScience]] free and open source platform.

 * [[https://www.myhsts.org|High School Technology Services]] for general Python

 * [[https://python.land/python-tutorial|Python Land: A completely free beginners tutorial with interactive, editable code examples]]

Print a [[https://blog.finxter.com/python-cheat-sheet/|cheat sheet]] of the most important Python features and post it to your office wall until you know the basics well.

Once you have read a tutorial, you can browse through [[http://docs.python.org|Python's online documentation]]. It includes [[http://docs.python.org/tut/|a tutorial]] that might come in handy, [[http://docs.python.org//lib/|a Library Reference]] that lists all of the modules that come standard with Python, and [[http://docs.python.org/ref/|the Language Reference]] for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.

When you are ready to write your first program, you will need a [[PythonEditors|text editor]] or an [[IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments|IDE]]. If you don't want to use Thonny or something more advanced, then you can use [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html|IDLE]], which is bundled with Python and supports [[http://idlex.sourceforge.net|extensions]].

This Python wiki also contains a page about [[Powerful Python One-Liners|Python One-Liners]] -- an obscure but interesting subculture in Python.

== Need Help? ==
Need help with any of this? Read [[BeginnersGuide/Help]] for mailing lists and newsgroups.

Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see IntroductoryBooks for suggested titles.

Consult [[BeginnersGuide/Examples]] for small programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.

Or, if you prefer to learn Python through listening to a lecture, you can attend a training course or even hire a trainer to come to your company. Consult the PythonEvents page to see if any training courses are scheduled in your area and the PythonTraining page for a list of trainers.

Teachers can join the [[http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/|EDU-SIG]], a mailing list for discussion of Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to university.

== Python Style Checker ==
 * [[http://pythonchecker.com/|Pythonchecker.com]] - An educative online tool to rate your Python style (with dynamic score computation and hints)

== Looking for a particular Python module or application? ==
 * The first place to look is the [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi|Python Package Index]].

 * If you can't find anything relevant in the Package Index,
 try [[http://www.python.org/search/|searching python.org]] - you can find anything mentioned on the Python site, in the [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/|FAQs]], or in the newsgroup. More info: [[http://www.python.org/search/|where to search]].

 * You may also try our external guest project, [[http://pydoc.net/|pydoc.net]], for advanced package and module search.

 * Next, try [[http://www.google.com|Google]] or another search engine of your choice. Searching for "python" and some relevant keywords will usually find something helpful.

 * Finally, you can try posting a query to the comp.lang.python Usenet group.
