===========

I am a computer programmer/analyst and network and system administrator, working for the government of Canada where I manage a small team of developers and techs.  I have a B.Sc with Honours in Computer Science from the University of Ottawa.  I have been programming and building systems for about 19 years now.

And I love Python! :)

Currently, I have a blog_ and a small Open Source project_.  I am also trying to get Python accepted at work as a valid development tool.
