[[http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/|DreamPie]] requires PyGTK, which, for Mac, requires [[http://www.macports.org|MacPorts]].

The installation instructions are:

 * Install !MacPorts.
 * Install X11.
 * Download the source archive and unpack it.
 * Run {{{sudo port install py26-pygtksourceview}}}. This may take a long time (even hours).
 * Run {{{python2.6 dreampie}}}.

Please add here any comments or suggestions.

Also, if anybody volunteers to create a !MacPorts package, it would be very nice!

== GError: Couldn't recognize the image file format for file ==

Joe !VanAndel experienced this problem, which caused !DreamPie to not start at all.

The fix is was to run {{{setenv XDG_DATA_DIRS /opt/local/share}}} before running !DreamPie.
