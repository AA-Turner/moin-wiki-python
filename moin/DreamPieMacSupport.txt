DreamPie requires PyGTK, which, for Mac, requires [[http://www.macports.org|MacPorts]].

The installation instructions are:

 * Install !MacPorts.
 * Install X11.
 * Download the source archive and unpack it.
 * Run {{{sudo port install py26-pygtksourceview}}}. This may take a long time (even hours).
 * Run {{{python2.6 dreampie}}}.

Please add here any comments or suggestions.

Also, if anybody volunteers to create a !MacPorts package, it would be very nice!
