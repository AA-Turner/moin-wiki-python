I also participate in [http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/LionKimbro the wxPython wiki,] and [http://www.seapig.org/LionKimbro the Seattle Python Interest Group wiki.]

SeaPig member.

=== Issues ===

It seems to me that this Wiki, ''the global Python wiki,'' should be more useful than, say, [http://www.seapig.org/MainPage the Seattle Python wiki.]

Somehow, it's not.

I suspect it has to do with broken window syndrome: The place is too clean, that nobody wants to touch it.

I'm "messing it up" with some content, to see if that's the case.

I would think that the Seattle python wiki should be just about local concerns and meeting updates. The real meat should go in here.

What's the real meat? Things like [http://www.seapig.org/ActualPythonCode sample python code.] Now there's something I can use.

Documentation of weird features. It's weird to me that there isn't a page here on "".join( [blah,blah] ), since that's something people get wrong all the time.

["lwickjr"]: I agree. I'm the one who added ["Asking for Help"] and ["Wanted..."], after reading intorductory material inviting users to add missing material. What I don't understand about "".join("a", "list", "of", "strings") is why anyone has problems with it. [On my first visit to the site, no less, if I recall correctly.] If they want "a list of strings" instead of "alistofstrings", they should use " ".join(...) instead. Please check out my page, and tell me what you think of the modules I describe there. Also, if you think you can handle it, please check out the requests in ["Wanted..."].
