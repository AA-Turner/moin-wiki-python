I also participate in [http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/LionKimbro the wxPython wiki,] and [http://www.seapig.org/LionKimbro the Seattle Python Interest Group wiki.]

SeaPig member.

=== Issues ===

It seems to me that this Wiki, ''the global Python wiki,'' should be more useful than, say, [http://www.seapig.org/MainPage the Seattle Python wiki.]

Somehow, it's not.

I suspect it has to do with broken window syndrome: The place is too clean, that nobody wants to touch it.

I'm "messing it up" with some content, to see if that's the case.

I would think that the Seattle python wiki should be just about local concerns and meeting updates. The real meat should go in here.

What's the real meat? Things like [http://www.seapig.org/ActualPythonCode sample python code.] Now there's something I can use.

Documentation of weird features. It's weird to me that there isn't a page here on "".join( [blah,blah] ), since that's something people get wrong all the time.
