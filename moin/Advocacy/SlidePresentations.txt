= Reusable Slide Presentations -- Only the Best! =

The Internet is full of slide presentations about Python.  The idea is to collect links (or attachments) to best ones, ones that are licensed under terms that permit reuse.  They should be under a Creative Commons license or equivalent, so that others can update, expand or rearrange the content.

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

As far as format, reStructuredText (rst2html ala S5) would be nice but at this point anything is welcome.  We can convert it for you.
