 Library of Video Lectures
===========================

A collection of video lectures suitable for projection at fledgling usergroup meetings to supply initial presentation material.

The video should be of high quality - readable on a large screen with audible sound, and given by a speaker who knows his stuff and presents well.  Flash-based video, as found on youtube.com, is often of low resolution.  Use the downloadable video formats for presentation.

 * `Python Design Patterns, Part 1`_ by Alex Martelli, March 2007  *(58 min 47 sec)*

   Design Patterns must be studied in the context on the language
   in which they'll get implemented (the Gang of Four made that
   point very strongly in their book, though almost everybody else
   seems not to have noticed :-). This talk explores several
   categories of classic "elementary" DPs in a Python context --
   Creational, Masquerading, Adaptation, and Template.

 * `Python Design Patterns, Part 2`_ by Alex Martelli, April 2007  *(44 min 28 sec)*

 * `Python 3000`_ by Guido van Rossum, July 2006  *(1 hr 6 min 41 sec)*

   The next major version of Python, nicknamed Python 3000 (or more
   prosaically Python 3.0), has been anticipated for a long time.
   For years I have been collecting and exploring ideas that were
   too radical for Python 2.x, and it's time to stop dreaming and
   start coding. In this talk I will present the community process
   that will be used to complete the specification for Python 3000,
   as well as some of the major changes to the language and the
   remaining challenges.

 * `Introducing Python`_ by Arlington Career Center Multimedia and Yorktown High School,  November 2006  *(23 min 50 sec)*

   A light-hearted introductory activity for a computer science
   course, this video contains interviews with luminaries from the
   Python community interspersed with A Python Love Story.

   A joint, interdisciplinary project between Arlington Career
   Center Multimedia and Yorktown High School Drama and Computing,
   the Python Project builds on the successful use of Python as a
   teaching tool in Yorktown's Computer Science Program. It was
   shown at the 9th and 10th International Python Conferences.
