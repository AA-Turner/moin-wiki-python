===========================
 Library of Meeting Topics
===========================

A collection of meeting topics suitable for reuse by fledgling usergroups who need ideas and kickstart materials for presentations.  

More than just a title, the entries should link to talk outlines or actual slide presentations, hopefully with speaker notes so someone else can run with them.

The formats sought, in order of preference, are:

 * `restructured text`_ documents and/or `reST/S5 slides`_
 * Openoffice/MS Office documents and slides
 * PDF documents

The goal is to provide modifiable materials under an `open license`_.

.. _`restructured text`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net
.. _`reST/S5 slides`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/slide-shows.html
.. _`open license`: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#FreeDocumentationLicenses
