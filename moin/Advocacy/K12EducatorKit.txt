= Python Advocacy Kit for K-12 Educators =

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit.  Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

''Suppose you're a teacher in a K-12 school and you'd like to adopt Python in the classroom.  Perhaps you're teaching programming or perhaps you're teaching physics, chemistry or some other topic and know that Python can give students the modeling and analysis tools gain further insight.  What materials would you need to make that happen?''

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

 * a "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython What is Python]" flyer
 * a "What is Python" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group
 * a "What is Python" podcast for sharing with those who aren't convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonInTheClassroom Python in the Classroom]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ReplaceMatlabWithPython Replacing Matlab with Python]" whitepaper
 * a whitepaper to share with your peers or a curriculum review board explaining why Python is relevant in today's educational environment.
 * a 2-sided flyer of Python resources, listing summary availability of user groups, books, trainers and speakers.
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithJava Using Python with Java] whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonForCppProgrammers Python for C++ Programmers]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithDotNet Using Python with .NET]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonAndDatabases Python and Databases]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ScientificPython Scientific Computing with Python]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#DataVisualizationWithPython Data Visualization and Graphing with Python]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#CoolPythonFeatures Cool Python Features]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToJava Comparing Python to Java]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToRuby Comparing Python to Ruby]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonSpeedIssues This Python is No Tortoise]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#GamingWithPython Gaming with Python]" whitepaper, for its potential educational uses
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup Starting a Python User Group]" whitepaper, for encouraging one on campus
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#CampusFlyer Campus Flyer]" to build student interest perhaps
 * ???

There is quite a mix of whitepapers above because it isn't possible to guess which topics the educator is teaching.  But by providing them all in a kit, the inside advocate can select those appropriate to his university.
