 5-Minutes With Python: A Video Series
=======================================

Remember being inspired [#]_ by the original Rails `Creating a weblog in 15 minutes`_ video, and again by Kevin Dangoor's `20-Minute Wiki`_ screencast?  Or these new *short* `Rails videos`_.  Well let's create a series of ten 5-minute videos showing off our favorite language, Python!

The aim is to show the breadth of possibilities that Python offers, to inspire the viewer and make it just a bit easier to spread the word.  Programmers new to or skeptical about Python can easily be pointed to the video pages.  Such content will certainly do the rounds in the blogosphere.
