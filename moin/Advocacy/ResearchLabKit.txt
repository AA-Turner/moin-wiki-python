= Python Advocacy Kit for Research Labs =

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit.  Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

''Suppose you're a scientist or engineer in a research lab and you'd like to adopt Python in your modeling, analysis or visualization work.  What materials would you need to make that happen?''

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

 * a "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython|What is Python]]" flyer
 * a "What is Python" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group
 * a "What is Python" podcast for sharing with those who aren't convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#ScientificPython|Scientific Computing with Python]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#ReplaceMatlabWithPython|Replacing Matlab with Python]]" whitepaper
 * a whitepaper to share with your peers or a curriculum review board explaining why Python is relevant in today's research lab environment.
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#DataVisualizationWithPython|Data Visualization and Graphing with Python]]" whitepaper
 * a 2-sided flyer of Python resources, listing summary availability of user groups, books, trainers and speakers.
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithJava|Using Python with Java]] whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonForCppProgrammers|Python for C++ Programmers]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithDotNet|Using Python with .NET]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonAndDatabases|Python and Databases]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToJava|Comparing Python to Java]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToRuby|Comparing Python to Ruby]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonSpeedIssues|This Python is No Tortoise]]" whitepaper
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup|Starting a Python User Group]]" whitepaper, for encouraging one within your facility
 * ???

There is quite a mix of whitepapers above because it isn't possible to guess which topics the researcher might need.  But by providing them all in a kit, the inside advocate can select those appropriate to his research facility.
