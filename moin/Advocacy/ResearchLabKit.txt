= Python Advocacy Kit for Research Labs =

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit.  Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

''Suppose you're a scientist or engineer in a research lab and you'd like to adopt Python in your modeling, analysis or visualization work.  What materials would you need to make that happen?''

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

 * a "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython What is Python]" flyer
 * a "What is Python" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group
 * a "What is Python" podcast for sharing with those who aren't convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ScientificPython Scientific Computing with Python]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ReplaceMatlabWithPython Replacing Matlab with Python]" whitepaper
 * a whitepaper to share with your peers or a curriculum review board explaining why Python is relevant in today's research lab environment.
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#DataVisualizationWithPython Data Visualization and Graphing with Python]" whitepaper
 * a 2-sided flyer of Python resources, listing summary availability of user groups, books, trainers and speakers.
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithJava Using Python with Java] whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonForCppProgrammers Python for C++ Programmers]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#UsingPythonWithDotNet Using Python with .NET]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonAndDatabases Python and Databases]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToJava Comparing Python to Java]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#ComparingPythonToRuby Comparing Python to Ruby]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#PythonSpeedIssues This Python is No Tortoise]" whitepaper
 * "[wiki:Self:AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup Starting a Python User Group]" whitepaper, for encouraging one within your facility
 * ???

There is quite a mix of whitepapers above because it isn't possible to guess which topics the researcher might need.  But by providing them all in a kit, the inside advocate can select those appropriate to his research facility.
