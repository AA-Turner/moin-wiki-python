= Python Advocacy Kit for College Students =

The intent of this page is to collect ideas on what should be included in such a kit.  Elsewhere, we are soliciting flyers and whitepapers which when finished will be used to make up advocacy kits.

''Suppose you're a college student who enjoys programming in Python and you would like to encourage others on your campus to join in.  What materials would you need to make that happen?''

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

----
 * a [[AdvocacyWritingTasks#CampusFlyer|campus flyer]] advertising user group meetings on campus, single-sided for posting onto bulletin boards
 * a "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#WhatIsPython|What is Python]]" flyer
 * a "What is Python" introductory video for sharing or showing in a group
 * a "What is Python" podcast for sharing with those who aren't convinced to spend time at a user group meeting (unlike the video, for listening while doing something else)
 * a whitepaper to share with an instructor or university staff explaining why Python is relevant to today's education
 * "[[AdvocacyWritingTasks#StartingAPythonUserGroup|How to Start a User Group]]" whitepaper
 * ???
