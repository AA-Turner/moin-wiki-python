= Idea Collection Page for Possible Python Promotion Items =

''Having cool merchandise is one way to spread the word about Python.  We all love a T-shirt with a good idea on it.  And a carefully understanded polo shirt works well too.  But what else might work?''

While the ["PSF"] may offer some of these items, the goal is not necessarily to raise funds but to promote the adoption of Python.  We prefer items that cast Python in a favorable light over those that are just cute.

And what size of poster would you want?  Is 11"x14" good enough?  The ''right'' size is probably dependent on the content.  An 11"x14" Zen of Python poster is probably good for cubicle art.
