= Reusable Classroom Handouts =

The idea is to collect links (or attachments) to handouts that can be reused in various classroom scenarios.  They should be under a Creative Commons license or equivalent, so that others can update, expand or rearrange the content.

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

As far as format, reStructuredText would be nice but at this point anything is welcome.  We can convert it for you.
