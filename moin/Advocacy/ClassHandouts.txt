= Reusable Classroom Handouts =

The idea is to collect links (or attachments) to handouts that can be reused in various classroom scenarios.  They should be under a Creative Commons license or equivalent, so that others can update, expand or rearrange the content.

This wiki page is a collection point - we will later relocate, organize with other related content and write abstracts about them so that others can find them more easily.

As far as format, reStructuredText would be nice but at this point anything is welcome.  We can convert it for you.

''Jeff, feel free to delete this comment, but shouldn't we seek fairly solid redistribution guarantees in the licences recommended? CC licences are quite incompatible with various operating system distributions, yet things like Dive Into Python have been successfully bundled with distributions before now. Isn't that a desirable thing?'' -- PaulBoddie
