= Reusable Classroom Handouts =

The idea is to collect links (or attachments) to handouts that can be reused in various classroom scenarios.  They should be under a Creative Commons license or equivalent, so that others can update, expand or rearrange the content.

This wiki page is a collection point - we will relocate them later, organize and write abstracts about them so that others can find them easily.

As far as format, reStructureText would be nice but at this point anything is welcome.  We can convert it for you.
