Charter
=======

To encourage the creation of new usergroups worldwide and to strengthen those that already exist.  At PyCon 2007 the following priority items were selected for initial implementation:

1. Improve the ability of site visitors to find usergroups near them.
2. Design and provide a support kit to those seeking to form new usergroups.  There may be monetary items that can be given, in consultation with the PSF.
3. Create a mailing list for the organizers of current and future usergroups to share ideas and mentor new groups.
4. Encourage and support usergroups in creating per-group mailing lists on mail.python.org.

Active Task List/Assignments

1. Come up with the goals of the committee. (the what)

   1. Study how to get usergroups onto local google.
   2. Start an overall newsletter (PDF/eZine) about usergroups, by PSF.
   3. Raise visibility of usergroups by: a. blogging about them, b. interviews with leaders on Python411, and c. articles in The Python Papers
   4. support UGs with initial speakers or a speaking tour.
3. Are there any other resources the committee needs?                                                                                    
4. A discussion of how people would like to proceed.                                                                                     

What Does Auditing The Usergroups Mean?
=======================================

Follow each link from the `local usergroups` wiki
 - note those with broken links
 - note whether they have a mailing list or not, and where is it
   hosted (mail.python.org or elsewhere)
 - note the posting address to their mailing list
 - peek into their mail archives and judge whether they are still
   active
 - determine from their website, where possible, who their contact
   people are
 - confirm their choice of discussion language (German, French, etc.)

Questions to Answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Maintain a mailing list for group organizers and another list for this committee, or share one list?
2. How can we improve the findability of usergroups without writing software - PSF wants a non-software solution.
3. How can we effectively audit the existing usergroups - I (Jeff) have started a spreadsheet and investigated some groups but it is slow, tedious work.  Also cannot audit languages I don't speak.
4. What other benefits can the PSF bestow upon usergroups to strengthen them?
5. Do we want to meet on IRC periodically?  How often?

Proposed Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - As part of audit, we need to collect email addresses of organizers; not all group webpages have them, many only have a mailing list.
 - Once we have an email list of group organizers, work up an official announcement to them:
    - welcoming them to the organizers mailing list
    - pointing them to the support kit
 - Work up a general announcement inviting those who lack a usergroup near them to:
    - join the organizers mailing list
    - download the support kit
    - register on the usergroup wiki
    - announce on the python-announce and python-users mailing list

Need Help
~~~~~~~~~

 - identifying `good lecture videos`_
 - rounding up `reusable presentation materials`_
 - auditing the various usergroups
 - suggestions for the `How to Start a Usergroup`_ document
 - creating generic flyers (if more than 'meeting at Joe's 8pm')
 - brainstorming on how to find members for new groups
