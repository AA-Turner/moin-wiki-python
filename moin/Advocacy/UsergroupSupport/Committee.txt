Charter
=======

To encourage the creation of new usergroups worldwide and to strengthen those that already exist.  At PyCon 2007 the following priority items were selected for initial implementation:

1. Improve the ability of site visitors to find usergroups near them.
2. Design and provide a support kit to those seeking to form new usergroups.  There may be monetary items that can be given, in consultation with the PSF.
3. Create a mailing list for the organizers of current and future usergroups to share ideas and mentor new groups.
4. Encourage and support usergroups in creating per-group mailing lists on mail.python.org.

Active Task List/Assignments
============================

1. Come up with the goals of the committee.                                                                                              
2. Come up with a set of action items.                                                                                                   
3. Are there any other resources the committee needs?                                                                                    
4. A discussion of how people would like to proceed.

Proposed Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Maintain a mailing list for group organizers and another list for this committee, or share one list?
 - How can we improve the findability of usergroups without writing software - PSF wants a non-software solution.
 - How can we effectively audit the existing usergroups - I (Jeff) have started a spreadsheet and investigated some groups but it is slow, tedious work.
 - As part of audit, we need to collect email addresses of organizers; not all group webpages have them, many only have a mailing list.
 - Once we have an email list of group organizers, work up an official announcement to them:
    - welcoming them to the organizers mailing list
    - pointing them to the support kit
 - Work up a general announcement inviting those who lack a usergroup near them to join the organizers mailing list and download the support kit
