PythonInWebPage presentation systems (see DataRepresentation) encourages the use of Python source code embedded in the content of a Web page (or other resource to be presented) such that the execution of the code causes the surrounding content to be transformed in some way. A classic, simplified example of this concept using JSP syntax might look like this:

{{{
<table>
  <%
  for item in items:
    %>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td><%= item.name %></td>
    </tr>
    <%
  %>
</table>
}}}

or like this ([[http://adullact.net/projects/pythml/|PythMl]] syntax)

{{{
<table>
for item in items:
  <tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <td>`item.name`</td>
  </tr>
</table>
}}}

Note that Python's need for indentation raises issues with how code blocks are to be delimited, especially in content which may itself be indented according to a different scheme, hence the use of an empty code block after the body of the loop in the above example.

Comparable technologies include: ASP (Active Server Pages), JSP (JavaServer Pages), PHP.
