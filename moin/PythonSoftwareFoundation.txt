== PSF Projects ==

=== 2011: PSF Sprints Program ===

''Active project''

The PSF funds and helps organize a Python sprints program. See [[http://pythonsprints.com/|pythonsprints.com]] for details.

PSF Project Leader: Jesse Noller

=== 2011: PyPI Cloud Mirroring Project ===

''Active project''

A group of PSF members is working on creating a stable PyPI mirroring installation that uses a content delivery network to make PyPI more robust and performant.

PSF Project Leader: MarcAndreLemburg

=== 2011: PSF Python Brochure Project ===

''Active project''

The PSF is underwriting the development of a professional quality Python image brochure to be used in marketing Python to businesses, governments, schools, etc.

The printed brochure will be made available to conferences, user groups, companies and schools.

PSF Project Leader: MarcAndreLemburg

=== 2006 + 2007: Grants Program ===

''Project completed''

The PSF started a grants program to fund Python-related conferences, activities and development.  For more information, see [[http://www.python.org/psf/grants/|PSF Grants]].

Note that while the grants program was ended, the PSF is still accepting applications for grants and helps fund conferences, events and project all around the world.

PSF Project Leader: Martin von LÃ¶wis

=== 2006: Python Advocacy Coordinator ===

''Project completed''

In August 2006, the PSF board voted to fund [[http://python.org/psf/grants/advocacy/orig-proposal.pdf|a proposal]] from Jeff Rush for him to act as a full time Python Advocacy Coordinator for a period of six months.  In this position, Jeff will work full time on developing and implementing an effective advocacy strategy for Python. His tasks will include writing content for the website and printable brochures for conferences, expanding Python's coverage in technical journals, and building a more effective network of advocacy volunteers from the community. Jeff is known for his work on PyCon 2006, and will be reporting to a group of several PSF directors and officers (initially Stephan Deibel, Chairman of the Board, and Neal Norwitz, Assistant Treasurer).

For details and progress reports see PythonAdvocacyCoordinator.

PSF Project Leader: Jeff Rush

=== 2005: Python.org website redesign ===

''Project completed''

In January 2005, the PSF board voted to fund a proposal (see WebsiteRedesignProposal) from Tim Parkin and Matt Goodall to
develop a new framework for the python.org website.  The purpose of this is to update the look for the python.org site and move to a 
more accessible and modern design (based on CSS), while keeping maintenance of the site simple and avoiding reliance on heavy monolithic tools.

This website has now been rolled out, although work on content
and the toolset is ongoing.  For details see

Project Leader: Tim Parkin

== PSF License and Trademarks ==

=== Use of Trademarks or Python License ===

Our most commonly asked question is about use of the name "Python"
or the Python logo, both of which are trademarks.  If you want to use
these, please see the PSF's Trademark Usage Policy at http://python.org/psf/trademarks.  Variants of the logo are available at http://python.org/community/logos.

The second most commonly asked questions involve the Python 
software license (whether Python can be included in another
product, terms of the license, etc).  For that, see PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq.

=== PSF License ===

'''Important''':  See PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq before 
using the following licenses.

 * PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseV2Easy -- Approved Oct 22, 2004 as the official Python Software Foundation License Version 2

 * PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseV2Revised -- Revised license that may be used as the basis for Version 3 in the future.

=== PSF Software Contribution Agreement ===

The following agreement is being used for contributors to 
Python, to ensure that all of the source code and documentation
in Python are properly licensed.

 * http://www.python.org/psf/contrib.html

== Historical Records ==

 * http://zope.org/Members/lemburg/psc-wiki/FrontPage/view -- wiki containing older information on fund raising, from the days before the PSF become a 501(c)3 non-profit.

 * PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseV2 -- Old draft for Python Software Foundation License Version 2 (not adopted and now defunct)

== Discussion ==

=== How do Modules Become Part of the Python Distribution? ===

I've always wondered:

How do modules become part of the Python distribution? What kind of process do you follow, what groups do you participate in, to become a part of that?

I've looked around, but haven't found any web pages on the subject.

-- LionKimbro <<DateTime(2004-06-28T21:22:21Z)>>

Answer: The final decision is by BDFL pronouncement, but the usual process is that the module is first written as a stand-alone module, and released. After it's been in use for some time, the author makes the suggestion in comp.lang.python or python-dev (both are used, I'm not sure which is preferred) that it be adopted into the standard distribution. This gets discussed by the usual crowd and usually the answer is obvious long before it ever gets to Guido. Certain modules skip the stand-alone stage and are adopted directly into the standard library, but that is usually because the module was written in response to requests, and frequently by an experienced python core developer. If you are interested in getting your module adopted into the core, the #1 question you are sure to be asked is "are you willing to commit to supporting this module for at least the next 5 years?", because unless SOMEONE is willing to volunteer to provide that support the module can't be accepted.
