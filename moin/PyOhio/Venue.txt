The [http://www.columbuslibrary.org/ Columbus Public Library] has been selected as the venue for PyOhio 2008.

Parking in the attached garage costs $4 / day; consider carpooling or using public transportation, as well.  

The following notes are being left here for future use (planning PyOhio 2009, for example.)

= Venue Considerations =

 * Room for approximately 100-150 attendees.

 * A single room or area big enough to hold everyone for a [:PyOhio/Schedule:plenary session] or two.  

    (Is a plenary session mandatory? - CatherineDevlin)

 * Space to break up into 2 concurrent talks of ~50 attendees each, plus 2 Open Space groups of ~ 20 each 

 * Wireless!  Absolutely crucial if we have sprints, very desirable otherwise

= Possible Venues =

 * Ohio Supercomputing Center

    They did, after all, put this on: http://www.osc.edu/press/releases/2007/python.shtml

 * Universities / colleges

    - OSU

    - Ohio University: Lancaster Campus (30 mi SE of Columbus)

    - Columbus State Community College

    - Franklin University

    - Otterbein

    - Ohio Dominican

 * High schools

 * Library

    The Columbus Public Library has a very generous policy on letting groups meet: http://evanced.columbuslibrary.org/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp  

    * Auditorium fits "200" (I think that's optimistic, but the point is it should be enough for us, even for a plenary)

    * Auditorium has 22 power outlets; that should be fine, especially if we supplement with some power strips

    * Can serve food in auditorium

    * "Board room" seats 30

    * "the Loft", classroom with 20 computers already in place

    * 2 small conference rooms seating 15 and 10

    * Some of the rooms come with projectors

    * Lots of extra spaces could be used as overflow open space: glassed-in group study areas, etc.

    * They're OK with us reserving all the rooms

    * Rooms are pretty

    * Wireless

    * No charge

    * Well-known, central location

    * Accessible by bus

    * Parking in attached garage is not free (but it's $4 / day, that's really not bad)

    * Rooms are not all contiguous (but I think it's OK for people to walk through the library a little bit)


 * Private company

    Anyplace with substantial Python-using population might be willing

 * Training companies

    The Cincinnati and Dayton branches of New Horizons have been friendly to user groups; is that true of Columbus?

 * [http://www.oclc.org/conferencecenter/default.htm OCLC]

    It looks like a nice facility, and it's said they have some Python users.  My only worry is that they'll want $, but it can't hurt to ask.

 * Art centers, community centers

    I believe these would all require payment.
