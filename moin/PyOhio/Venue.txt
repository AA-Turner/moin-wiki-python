We are still investigating venues.

= Venue Considerations =

 * Room for approximately 100-150 attendees.

 * A single room or area big enough to hold everyone for a [:PyOhio/Schedule:plenary session] or two.

 * Space to break up into 2 concurrent talks of ~50 attendees each, plus 2 Open Space groups of ~ 20 each 

 * Wireless!  Absolutely crucial if we have sprints, very desirable otherwise

= Possible Venues =

Places to check with:

 * Ohio Supercomputing Center

    They did, after all, put this on: http://www.osc.edu/press/releases/2007/python.shtml

 * Universities

 * High schools

 * Library

    The Columbus Public Library has a very generous policy on letting groups meet: http://evanced.columbuslibrary.org/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp  The only problem is the funny capacity: a 200-seating auditorium (OK but overkill) and two conference rooms (seating 15 and 10).  That would suit a single talk track and two open spaces OK, but things would get funny in the afternoon when it's all open spaces.

 * Private company

    Anyplace with substantial Python-using population might be willing

 * Training companies

    The Cincinnati and Dayton branches of New Horizons have been friendly to user groups; is that true of Columbus?

 * [http://www.oclc.org/conferencecenter/default.htm OCLC]

    It looks like a nice facility, and it's said they have some Python users.  My only worry is that they'll want $, but it can't hurt to ask.
