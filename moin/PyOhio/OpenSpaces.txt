= Open Spaces at POhio =

[http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-Openspace.html Open Spaces] are set aside at PyOhio (and [us.pycon.org PyCon], and many similar conferences) for attendees to create their own creative content on the fly.  PyOhio will have 1-3 rooms available for Open Space use throughout the day.  One of the Open Space rooms will have an overhead projector.

== What can you do with Open Spaces? ==

  * Informal, unplanned discussion on a topic

  * A cooperative workshop with multiple people contributing

  * A [http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/2008/03/teach-me-twisted.html Teach Me Twisted]-style learner-driven class (oh, please, let's do at least one of these!)

  * A regular-style talk outside the regular talk schedule

  * A follow-up discussion following a regular talk

  * Something just for fun (board game, card game, sing-a-long...) 

  * Anything else you can think of...

== Who can schedule an Open Space event? ==

You can!  You don't need a detailed plan, and you don't need anybody's approval.  All you need is a desire to see some people come together and learn from each other.

== How do I schedule an Open Space? ==

There will be a large posterboard at PyOhio used for Open Space scheduling, with slots representing each available room for each time slot.  Take an index card (they'll be provided), write down a topic and your name, and stick it to the board.  Show up and see what happens!

Optionally, if you have a specific idea for an Open Space in mind ahead of time, you may propose it on this page (edit the page by clicking the word-balloon-shaped icon at the upper right of this page) by putting the topic name, your name, and any notes you want to add.  That gives people a chance to work up some enthusiasm and ideas in advance.  If you like, you show that enthusiasm by listing your own name here under the organizer's.

== Sounds crazy.  Does that actually work? ==

It does!  People who've tried it generally come quickly to love it.  In any case, the [http://www.openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm Law of Two Feet] means that you can try an Open Space event for *precisely as long as you are benefiting from it* - if you aren't, then you are obligated (not just allowed) to leave.  There's no reason not to try it!
