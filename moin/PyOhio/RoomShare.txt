Can you help a friendly out-of-town Python user afford their stay in Columbus for PyOhio?

If you have space in your house / apartment / cardboard box, or if you're looking for someone who can loan space, please list your name and email address here (along with any other details that may be useful).

Thanks so much for helping make PyOhio a region-wide event!

If you plan to get a hotel room, and would like to share the room and cost with another PyOhio attendee, sign up here with your name, email address, and any other details that may be useful.

 * Steve Johnson (diordna@gmail.com) looking to share a room both nights, probably at the Red Roof Inn nearby. Will be arriving Friday afternoon.
 * William McVey (wam@cisco.com) - Just booked a room for Saturday night at the Blackwell (at the PyOhio rate). Wouldn't mind splitting the cost with a roommate though. Let me know ASAP so I can switch from the one King to two Queen bed option (the receptionist said they still have plenty of rooms so that shouldn't be a problem).
