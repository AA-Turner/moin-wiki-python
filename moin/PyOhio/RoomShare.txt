Can you help a friendly out-of-town Python user afford their stay in Columbus for PyOhio?

If you have space in your house / apartment / cardboard box, or if you're looking for someone who can loan space, please list your name and email address here (along with any other details that may be useful).

Thanks so much for helping make PyOhio a region-wide event!

If you plan to get a hotel room, and would like to share the room and cost with another PyOhio attendee, sign up here with your name, email address, and any other details that may be useful.
