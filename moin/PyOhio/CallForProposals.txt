==============================
PyOhio Call For Proposals 2010
==============================

PyOhio 2010, the third annual Python programming conference for Ohio and the surrounding region, will take place Saturday-Sunday, July 31-Aug 1, 2010 at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. A variety of activities are planned, including tutorials, scheduled talks, Lightning Talks, Open Spaces and Sprints.

PyOhio invites all interested people to submit proposals for scheduled talks, tutorials, and panels. All topics of interest to Python programmers will be considered. Standard presentation slots will be 40 minutes plus a 10 minute question-and-answer period.

PyOhio is especially interested in hosting a Beginner's Track for those new to Python or new to programming in general. If your proposal would be suitable for inclusion in a Beginner's Track, please indicate so. Organizers will work with speakers and instructors in the Beginner's Track to help them coordinate their talks/tutorials into a smooth, coherent learning curve for new Python users.

To ensure that you provide all necessary information, please use the submission template provided below. If organizing a panel, please confirm all panelists' intention to participate before submitting your proposal.

PyOhio may record presentations for later release over the web. Presenters will need to sign a release of recording rights to PyOhio; see http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyOhio/RecordingRelease

All proposals should be emailed to cfp@pyohio.org for review. Please submit proposals by May 10, 2010. Accepted speakers will be notified by May 24.
