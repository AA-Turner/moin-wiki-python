PyOhio:  Call for Proposals
---------------------------

PyOhio 2009, the second annual Python programming mini-conference for Ohio
and surrounding areas, will take place Saturday-Sunday, July 25-26, 2009
at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.  A variety of activities
are planned, including tutorials, scheduled talks, Lightning Talks, and Open Spaces.

PyOhio invites all interested people to submit proposals for scheduled
talks and tutorials.  PyOhio will accept abstracts on any topics of interest
to Python programmers.

Standard presentations are expected to last 40 minutes with a 10 minute
question-and-answer period.  Other talk formats will also be considered,
however; please indicate your preferred format in your proposal.  Hands-on 
tutorial sessions are also welcomed.  Tutorial instructors should indicate
the expected length

PyOhio is especially interested in hosting a Beginners' Track for those
new to Python or new to programming in general.  If your proposal would
be suitable for inclusion in the Beginners' Track, please indicate so.
Organizers will work with speakers and instructors in the Beginners' Track 
to help them coordinate their talks/tutorials into a smooth, coherent 
learning curve for new Python users.

All proposals should include abstracts no longer than 500
words in length.  Abstracts must include the title, summary of the
presentation, the expertise level targeted, and a brief description
of the area of Python programming it relates to.

All proposals should be emailed to cfp@pyohio.org for review.  Please
submit proposals by May 15, 2009.  Accepted speakers will be notified by
June 1.
