= Game Social =

I'll be bringing some board/card games. Perhaps on Saturday evening if folks are tired from sprinting, we might start up a fun game to socialize. This could be done either at the conference hall or the hotel. Details will likely emerge onsite and announced on here, on twitter and IRC.

The following games will be brought:
