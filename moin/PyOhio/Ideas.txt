For things we didn't do this year, but might want to do next year.

== Volunteer recognition ==

I'm imagining special stickers to add to your name badge:

- Staff, for people with official offices

- Organizer, for participants on pyohio-organizers

- Speaker

- Gold stars.  Staff members would carry a bunch of gold stars and give them to people who provide that crucial on-the-fly impromptu help.  We could even set a swag prize aside for the person with the most gold stars...

== Open Space recognition ==

Open-space organizers should put their names on the open-space cards they put up (that's actually part of the official open-space "protocol".  Set a swag prize aside to give to a random open-space organizer.

== Program Guide ==
Presenter contact info (email, twitter, URL, whatever) should be listed in the program guide. Perhaps also an errata URL where presos can be announced, discussion groups can form, etc.
