= Poster Session =

A poster session is a concept borrowed from academic conferences.

Any PyOhio attendees are invited to make and bring a poster describing any Python-related topic.  The posters will be up all day long, and attendees can look over them at their leisure.  During the Poster Session, poster authors stay in the vicinity of their posters so that attendees can discuss them.  Each poster serves to nucleate a tiny Open Space on its own topic.

Anyone can present a poster, and posters can be combined with Lightning Talks and/or Open Spaces on the same topic.  Sign up here with your name and your poster topic, so that we can get an idea of what to expect.
