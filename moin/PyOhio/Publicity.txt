Some of the things that we would like to do include:

 * Get the word out to local bloggers to have them blog about the conference and generate hype.

 * Once talks are confirmed, do interviews with some of the speakers to get people curious about what's going on.

 * Do spotlights on some of the things we're doing at the conference. Feature things like:

  * What are sprints?

  * What are lightning talks?

  * What are open spaces?
