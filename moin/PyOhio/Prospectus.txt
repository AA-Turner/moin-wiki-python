PyOhio 2010 Sponsorship
-----------------------

PyOhio is a regional conference for people interested in the programming
language with the biggest bite: Python! If you are considering sponsoring
any technology events in Ohio or the Midwest, please consider PyOhio!

From 2008 to 2009, PyOhio grew from a one-day event with over 90 attendees
to an all-weekend conference with over 130.  The variety of talks and 
cooperative coding opportunities drew passionate programmers from the Ohio region and
far beyond.  For 2010, we expect the biggest turnout ever!

You can visit PyOhioâ€™s online home at `www.pyohio.org <http://www.pyohio.org>`_.

What is PyOhio?
---------------

PyOhio is a two-day conference focusing on the Python programming
language. The conference will include seminars, workshops, 
tutorials, panel discussions, open spaces, code sprints,
and lightning talks on all aspects of Python, with components 
covering introductory to advanced skill levels.

PyOhio 2010 will take place Saturday, July 31 and Sunday, August 1
at Ohio State University in Columbus.

What is Python?
---------------

Python is a general-purpose programming language usable on every common
operating system, alone or under .NET or J2EE.  
Python is applicable to all types of programming problems, including 
web programming, system administration, desktop applications, and others;
it has become a key element in IT infrastructures worldwide.
Many programmers who are proficient in several languages strongly
prefer Python for its clarity, ease of use, and maintanability.

Why sponsor PyOhio?
-------------------

PyOhio attendees are a variety of working professionals, students,
academics, and others who are passionate about technology and passionate about
keeping themselves up-to-date - so much so that they'll take a weekend
of their own to immerse themselves in their favorite (but not their only)
language.  This makes them the acknowledged leaders in their fields, the 
ones their peers look to.  Sponsoring PyOhio lets the attendees know that,
like them, you stand out - that your organization shares their love of 
excellence in technology.  This is your chance to influence an exceptionally 
influential group of professionals with your sponsorship message!

PyOhio is run entirely by a group of regional volunteers, but is held in 
cooperation with the Python Software Foundation.  Your PyOhio sponsorship 
should qualify as a pre-tax business expense; however, if you require a 
an official 501(c) organization, please write to our Sponsorship Coordinator about
sponsoring PyOhio via the PSF.
