PyOhio 2009 Sponsorship
-----------------------

PyOhio is a regional conference for people interested in the programming
language with the biggest bite: Python! If you are considering sponsoring
any technology events in Ohio or the Midwest, please consider PyOhio!

The first PyOhio was a one-day event, held in July, 2008
at the main branch of the Columbus Public Library. We drew over 90 people
from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, and beyond - as far as New Hampshire.

This year, PyOhio is expanding to a two-day event, July 25-26, 2009.  It will
be held at Ohio State University's Knowlton Hall, with a variety of lecture 
halls, breakout rooms, and other spaces to accomodate more attendees and activities.

You can visit PyOhioâ€™s online home at `www.pyohio.org <http://www.pyohio.org>`_.

What is PyOhio?
---------------

PyOhio is a two-day conference focusing on the Python programming
language. The conference will include seminars, workshops, 
tutorials, panel discussions, open spaces, and lightning talks on all
aspects of Python, with components covering introductory to advanced
skill levels.

For 2009, PyOhio will be held on Saturday, July 25th, and Sunday, July 26th.

What is Python?
---------------

Python is a general-purpose programming language usable on every common
operating system, alone or under .NET or J2EE.  
Python is applicable to all types of programming problems, including 
web programming, system administration, desktop applications, and others;
it has become a key element in IT infrastructures worldwide.
Many programmers who are proficient in several languages strongly
prefer Python for its clarity, ease of use, and maintanability.

Why sponsor PyOhio?
-------------------

PyOhio attendees are a variety of working professionals, students,
academics, and others who are passionate about technology and passionate about
keeping themselves up-to-date - so much so that they'll take a weekend
of their own to immerse themselves in their favorite (but not their only)
language.  This makes them the acknowledged leaders in their fields, the 
ones their peers look to.  Sponsoring PyOhio lets the attendees know that,
like them, you stand out - that your organization shares their love of 
excellence in technology.  This is your chance to influence an exceptionally 
influential group of professionals with your sponsorship message!

PyOhio is run entirely by a group of volunteers, and is not yet an officially 
registered non-profit organization.  Your PyOhio sponsorship should qualify as 
a pre-tax business expense, however.
