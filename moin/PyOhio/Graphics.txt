= Potential PyOhio Graphics =

I had some logo ideas this evening and so I noodled around with Illustrator a little bit... Here's what I came up with so far.  Aside from the favicon, these are all vector art so they can be resized, colored, etc. as needed.

'''Full Logo'''

'''Small Logo'''

'''Aww, a favicon too...'''
