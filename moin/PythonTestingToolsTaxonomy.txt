It also allows reporting from tests in another process into the unittest framework, giving a single integrated test environment. ||
||[[https://launchpad.net/testresources|testresources]] ||unittest extensions ||[[https://launchpad.net/~lifeless|Robert Collins]] || ||Provides a mechanism for managing 'resources' - expensive bits of infrastructure - that are needed by multiple tests. Resources are constructed and free on demand, but with an optional [[http://pycheesecake.org/wiki/TestSuite|TestSuite?]], the test run order is optimised to reduce the number of resource constructions and releases needed. Compatible with unittest. ||
||[[https://www.reahl.org/project?name=tofu|reahl.tofu]] ||unit testing ||[[https://www.reahl.org|Iwan Vosloo]] || ||Provides class based test Fixtures, in which several (usually interrelated) objects that need to be set up for tests are lumped together on a single object, called a Fixture. Fixtures are reusable and can depend on other Fixtures in turn. Fixtures can be used with any test framework, but easy integration is provided for pytest. A few other test utilities are included as well. ||

== Mock Testing Tools ==
See also [[http://garybernhardt.github.com/python-mock-comparison|here]] for a side-by-side syntax comparison between some of the more popular tools in this space.
||'''Tool''' ||'''Category''' ||'''Author''' ||'''Claim to fame''' ||
||[[http://github.com/nsigustavo/ludibrio/|Ludibrio]] ||mocks, stubs, spy, and dummies ||Gustavo Rezende ||Elegant test doubles framework in Python (mocks, stubs, spy, and dummies) ||
||[[http://python-mock.sourceforge.net/|Python Mock]] ||mock testing ||[[http://www.thedeveloperscoach.com/|Dave Kirby]] ||Python Mock enables the easy creation of mock objects that can be used to emulate the behaviour of any class that the code under test depends on. You can set up expectations about the calls that are made to the mock object, and examine the history of calls made. This makes it easier to unit test classes in isolation. [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-mock/|Download it here.]] ||
||[[http://theblobshop.com/pymock|PyMock]] ||mock testing ||[[http://theblobshop.com/|Jeff Younker]] ||PyMock is based on the Java [[http://www.easymock.org/|easymock]] package. It uses a recording and replay model rather than using a specification language. Easymock lives up to its name compared to other mocking packages. PyMock takes advantage of python's dynamic nature for futher improvements. ||
||[[http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock.html|mock]] ||mock testing ||Michael Foord aka [[http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml|Fuzzyman]] ||Provides "action -> assertion" mocking patter, instead of standard "record -> replay" pattern ||
||[[http://pmock.sourceforge.net/|pMock]] ||mock testing ||Graham Carlyle ||Inspired by the Java [[http://www.jmock.org/|jMock]] library, pMock makes the writing of unit tests using mock object techniques easier. Development of pmock has long since stopped and so it can be considered dead. ||
||[[http://blog.ianbicking.org/minimock.html|minimock]] ||mock testing ||[[http://blog.ianbicking.org/|Ian Bicking]] ||Embeds mock testing constructs inside doctest tests. ||
||[[http://oakwinter.com/code/svnmock/|svnmock]] ||mock testing ||[[http://oakwinter.com/code/|Collin Winter]] ||enables easier testing of Python programs that make use of [[http://subversion.tigris.org/|Subversion's]] Python bindings ||
||[[http://labix.org/mocker|Mocker]] ||mock testing ||[[http://blog.labix.org/|Gustavo Niemeyer]] ||Graceful platform for test doubles in Python (mocks, stubs, fakes, and dummies). Well-documented and fairly feature-complete. ||
||[[https://www.reahl.org/project?name=stubble|Stubble]] ||stub testing ||[[https://www.reahl.org/|Iwan Vosloo]] ||Stubble allows you to write arbitrary classes for use as stubs instead of read classes while testing. Stubble lets you link a stub class loosely to the real class which it is a stub for. This information is then used to ensure that tests will break if there is a discrepancy between the interface supported by your stub class and that of the real class it stands in for. ||
||[[http://code.google.com/p/pymox/|Mox]] ||mock testing ||smiddlek, dglasser ||Mox is based on EasyMock, a Java mock object framework. Mox will make mock objects for you, so you don't have to create your own! It mocks the public/protected interfaces of Python objects. You set up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific language (DSL), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor! ||
||[[http://github.com/gfxmonk/mocktest/tree/master|MockTest]] ||mock testing ||Tim Cuthbertson (gfxmonk) ||Mocktest allows you to mock / stub objects and make expectations about the methods you expect to be called as well as the arguments they should be called with. Expectations are very readable and expressive, and checked automatically. Any stubbed methods are reverted after each test case. Still under development, so subject to change ||
||[[http://farmdev.com/projects/fudge/|Fudge]] ||mock and stub testing ||[[http://farmdev.com/|Kumar McMillan]] ||A module for using fake objects (mocks, stubs, etc) to test real ones. Uses a declrative syntax like jMock whereby you set up expectations for how an object should be used. An error will raise if an expectation is not met. ||
||[[http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/MockitoForPython|Mockito for Python]] ||mock and stub testing ||[[http://monkeyisland.pl/|Szczepan Faber]] ||A port of the [[http://code.google.com/p/mockito/|Mockito]] mocking framework to Python. (Technically speaking, Mockito is a Test Spy framework.) ||
||[[http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=capturemock|CaptureMock]] ||mock testing ||Geoff Bache ||True record-replay approach to mocking. Requires no coding, just telling it which modules/attributes you want to mock. Then stores the behaviour in an external file, which can be used to test the code without those modules installed. ||
||[[http://has207.github.com/flexmock/|flexmock]] ||mock/stub/spy testing and fake objects ||[[http://github.com/has207/|Herman Sheremetyev]] ||Port of the popular Ruby mocking library to Python. Includes automatic integration with most popular test runners. ||
||[[http://bitbucket.org/DavidVilla/python-doublex|doublex]] ||easy and powerful stubs, spies and mocks ||[[http://bitbucket.org/DavidVilla|David Villa]] ||Free and restricted doubles using hamcrest matchers for all assertions. It provides a wrapper for the pyDoubles framework. ||
||[[http://python-aspectlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html|aspectlib]] ||spies and mock responses ||[[http://blog.ionelmc.ro/|Ionel Cristian Mărieș]] ||Lightweight spies and mock responses, and a capture/replay framework (via the Story/Replay context managers). ||




== Fuzz Testing Tools ==
According to Wikipedia, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing|"fuzz testing" (or "fuzzing")]] is a software testing technique whose basic idea is to attach the inputs of a program to a source of random data ("fuzz"). If the program fails (for example, by crashing, or by failing built-in code assertions), then there are defects to correct. The great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior.
||'''Tool''' ||'''Author''' ||'''Claim to fame''' ||
||[[https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis|Hypothesis]] ||[[http://www.drmaciver.com/|David R. MacIver]] ||Hypothesis combines unit testing and fuzz testing by letting you write tests parametrized by random data matching some specification. It then finds and minimizes examples that make your tests fail. ||
||[[http://jester.sourceforge.net/|Pester]] ||Ivan Moore ||Tests your tests by mutating source code and finding tests that don't fail! ||
||[[http://peachfuzz.sourceforge.net/|Peach Fuzzer Framework]] ||Michael Eddington ||Peach can fuzz just about anything from .NET, COM/ActiveX, SQL, shared libraries/DLL's, network applications, web, you name it. ||
||[[http://antiparser.sourceforge.net/|antiparser]] ||dmckinney ||The purpose of antiparser is to provide an API that can be used to model network protocols and file formats by their composite data types. Once a model has been created, the antiparser has various methods for creating random sets of data that deviates in ways that will ideally trigger software bugs or security vulnerabilities. ||
||[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/taof|Taof (The Art Of Fuzzing)]] ||rodrigomarcos ||Taof is a GUI cross-platform Python generic network protocol fuzzer. It has been designed for minimizing set-up time during fuzzing sessions and it is specially useful for fast testing of proprietary or undocumented protocols. ||
||[[http://fusil.hachoir.org/trac|Fusil (Fusil the fuzzer)]] ||[[http://www.haypocalc.com/wiki/Victor_Stinner|Victor Stinner]] ||It helps to start process with a prepared environment (limit memory, environment variables, redirect stdout, etc.), start network client or server, and create mangled files. Fusil has many probes to detect program crash: watch process exit code, watch process stdout and syslog for text patterns (eg. "segmentation fault"), watch session duration, watch cpu usage (process and system load), etc. ||
||[[https://github.com/eerimoq/pyfuzzer|PyFuzzer]] ||Erik Moqvist ||Use libFuzzer to fuzz test Python 3.6+ C extension modules. ||




== Web Testing Tools ==
First, let's define some categories of Web testing tools:

 * '''Browser simulation''' tools: simulate browsers by implementing the HTTP request/response protocol and by parsing the resulting HTML

 * '''Browser automation''' tools: automate browsers by driving them for example via COM calls in the case of Internet Explorer, or XPCOM in the case of Mozilla

 * '''In-process''' or unit-test-type tools: call an application in the same process, instead of generating an HTTP request; so an exception in the application would go all the way up to the command runner (py.test, unittest, etc).

||'''Tool''' ||'''Category''' ||'''Author''' ||'''Part of''' ||'''Claim to fame''' ||

||[[http://github.com/ctb/pony-build|pony-build]] ||[[http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/|Titus Brown]] ||pony-build is a simple continuous integration package that lets you run a server to display client build results. It consists of two components, a server (which is run in some central & accessible location), and one or more clients (which must be able to contact the server via HTTP). Philosophy statement: good development tools for Python should be easy to install, easy to hack, and not overly constraining. Two out of three ain't bad ;). ||
||[[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox|tox]] ||[[http://holgerkrekel.net/about-me/|Holger Krekel]] ||Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool.
