== Toolserver Framework For Python ==

The Toolserver Framework For Python is a framework to create Web services. It allows very easy publishing of APIs via XMLRPC, SOAP and REST. REST APIs are built on more programmatical APIs with added wrappers that manage the data flow between the REST endpoints and the actual API method. All tools are available to build full fledged Web applications.

The project's homepage is at http://pyds.muensterland.org/wiki/toolserver.html
