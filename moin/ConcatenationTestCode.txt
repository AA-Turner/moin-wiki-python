Counter to the PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips, on python 2.4 the following string concatenation is almost twice as fast:
{{{
#!python
from time import time
t = time()

s = 'lksdajflakjdsflku09uweoir'
for x in range(40):
    s += s[len(s)/2:]
    
print 'duration:', time()-t
}}}

as:

{{{
#!python
from time import time
t = time()

s = 'lksdajflakjdsflku09uweoir'
for x in range(40):
    s = "".join((s, s[len(s)/2:]))
    
print 'duration:', time()-t
}}}

On the win32 Python 2.4 I'm seeing the join sample above complete in less than half the time of the concatenating sample.
 -db

Usually the join() is located ''outside'' the loop, that code makes this extremely hard though (becuase of the self-referencing of the generated string). But that situation is not the norm. -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2005-08-01T06:07:51Z)]]

Are you guys kidding? The whole page is contrieved.
Correct implementation of "join" is:
{{{
from time import time
t = time()

s = 'lksdajflakjdsflku09uweoir'
r = [s]
for x in range(40):
    r.append(s[len(s)/2:])
s = "".join(r)

print 'duration:', time()-t
}}}
which gives on PythonWin 2.4 (#60, Nov 30 2004, 09:34:21) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 execution times:
{{{
1st  duration: 54.4060001373
Last duration: 0.0160000324249
}}}

 Mike, that code generates a very different (and much shorter) s. Note how the original code takes the half of the ''preconcatenated'' s, making the size grow exponentially (which generates megabytes of data). -- JürgenHermann [[DateTime(2005-08-30T18:44:05Z)]]

A few notes (your mileage may vary - this is a 4Mb file being stripped of unprintable characters)
 * Regex replacement rather than creating a list and joining it is 2.5x faster than the tooling above
 * This is far slower than the equivalent Java code (around 4x slower) using String.charAt() and StringBuffers
