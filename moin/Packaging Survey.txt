= Part 1, how do you work ? =


Who are you ? (describe in a few sentence what do you do with
Python)

<open question>

How do you organize your application code ?

  - I put everything in one package
  - I create several packages and with one main package to launch the   
    application
  - I create several packages and use a tool like zc.buildout or Paver to 
    distribute the whole application

What are the tools you are using to package and distribute 
your Python application ?

  - None
  - distutils
  - setuptools
  - zc.buildout and setuptools
  - zc.buildout and distutils
  - Paver and distutils
  - Paver and setuptools

How do you install a package that does not provide an installer ?

  - I use easy_install
  - I use pip
  - I download it and run manually the install command
  - I use the packaging tool provided in my system (apt, yum, etc)

How do you remove a package ?

  - manually, by removing the folder and fixing the .pth files
  - using the packaging tool (apt, yum, etc)
  - I use one virtualenv per application, so the main python is not 
    polluted

Do you work with namespaced packages ? 

  - Yes
  - No

= Part 2, What's missing ? What is wrong ? =

What are in your opinion, the 5 most important problems (bad behaviors 
or lacks) in Distutils today ?

<open question>

Would you like to see Python's Distutils package provide an uninstall command that removes just the files installed, and cleanup the .pth, even if it does undesirable things ?

  - Yes
  - No

What are the 5 most important features that exists in third-party tools, 
you would like to see included by the Python standard Library ?
