This survey will be put online in a SurveyMonkey-like system whenever it is ready...

= Part 1, how do you work ? =


 * Who are you ? (one answer)

  1. Professional developer using Python exclusively.
  2. Professional developer using Python sometimes.
  3. Professional developer using Python unable to use Python "at work".
  4. Hobbyist using Python.

 * How do you organize your application code most of the time ? (one answer)

  1. I put everything in one package
  2. I create several packages and use a main package or script to launch the application
  3. I create several packages and use a tool like zc.buildout or Paver to distribute the whole application
  4. I use my own mechanism for aggregating packages into a single install.

 * For libraries you don't distribute publicly, do you you create a setup.py script? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No

 * What is the main tool or combination of tools you are using to package and distribute your Python application ? (one answer)

  1. None
  2. distutils
  3. setuptools
  4. zc.buildout and setuptools
  5. zc.buildout and distutils
  6. Paver and distutils
  7. Paver and setuptools
  8. Other : <say which>


 * How do you install a package that does not provide an standalone installer (but provides a standard setup.py script) most of the time ? (one answer)

  1. I use easy_install
  2. I use pip
  3. I download it and manually run the `python setup.py install` command
  4. I use the packaging tool provided in my system (apt, yum, etc)
  5. I move files around and create symlinks manually
  6. Other : <say which>


 * How do you remove a package ? (check all that apply)

  1. manually, by removing the folder and fixing the .pth files
  2. using the packaging tool (apt, yum, etc)
  3. I use one virtualenv per application, so the main python is never polluted, and only remove entire environments
  4. I change PYTHONPATH to include a directory of the packages used by my application, then remove just that directory
  5. I don't know / I fail at uninstallation

 * How do you manage using more than one version of a library on a system? (check all that apply)

  1. I don't use multiple versions of a library
  2. I use setuptools' multi-version features
  3. I use virtualenv
  4. I use zc.buildout
  5. I build fresh Python interpreter from source for each project
  6. I set PYTHONPATH to select particular libraries
  7. I set sys.path in my scripts
  8. Other: <say what>

 * Do you work with setuptools' namespaced packages ? A namespace package is a package that may be split across multiple project distributions.  For example, Zope 3's zope package is a namespace package, because subpackages like zope.interface and zope.publisher may be distributed separately (see http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No

 * Has PyPI become mandatory in your everyday work (if you use zc.buildout for example) ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No


 * If you previously answered Yes, did you set up an alternative solution (mirror, cache..) in case PyPI is down ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No

 * Do you register your packages to PyPI ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No


 * Do you upload your package to PyPI ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No


 * If you previously answered No, how do you distribute your packages ? (one answer)

  1. One my own website, using simple links
  2. One my own website, using a PyPI-like server
  3. On a forge, like sourceforge

 * Where are you located ?

  * <open question>


= Part 2, What's missing ? What is wrong ? =

 * What are in your opinion, the 5 most important problems (bad behaviors or missing features) in Distutils today ?

  * <open question>

 * Would you like to see Python's Distutils package provide an uninstall command that removes just the files installed, and cleans up .pth files, even if it does undesirable things ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No

 * Would you like to see Python's Distutils package provide an uninstall command that correctly removes the files installed by a package (without taking care of possible side-effect) **effects to be listed here** ? (one answer)

  1. Yes
  2. No

 * What are the 5 most important features that exists in third-party tools, you would like to see included by the Python standard Library ?

  * <open question>


 * What are the other things you like to say in order to help building Distutils roadmap ?

  * <open question>

= Questions =

 1. Regarding the questions that ask "what are the 5 most important X", is it possible for the survey to instead list a number of choices and let the person taking the survey rank them from most- to least-important?
