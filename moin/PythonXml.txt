A variety of XML processing solutions are available for Python. This page attempts, at the very least, to list the most actively developed or most easily available.

In the standard library:

 * ElementTree - the xml.etree package (new in Python 2.5)
 * MiniDom - the xml.dom.minidom package
 * ["Sax"] - the xml.sax package

Available separately:

 * [http://4suite.org/ 4Suite] - a framework for XML (and RDF) processing
 * [http://uche.ogbuji.net/tech/4suite/amara/manual Amara] - Amara provides tools you can trust to conform with XML standards without losing the familiar Python feel
 * [http://www.python.org/pypi/libxml2dom libxml2dom] - PyXML-style API for the libxml2 Python bindings
 * [http://codespeak.net/lxml/ lxml] - a "Pythonic" binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries that comes with all sorts of powerful XML tools, all integrated into an easy-to-use API
 * [http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/ PyXML] - the semi-official Python distribution for XML, now without a maintainer
 * [http://www.python.org/pypi/qtxmldom qtxmldom] - PyXML-style API for the qtxml Python bindings

== XSLT ==

 * [http://uche.ogbuji.net/tech/akara/nodes/2003-01-01/python-xslt XSLT tools for Python] - a collection of examples and links by Uche Ogbuji
 * [http://www.python.org/pypi/XSLTools XSLTools] - XSL transformations on top of libxslt and [http://www.python.org/pypi/libxml2dom libxml2dom], with added Web development support
 * [http://codespeak.net/lxml lxml] has excellent support for XSLT that is based on libxslt
 * Some tools linked from the [http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/#implementations XQuery homepage] provide Python bindings for their XSLT2 and XPath2 implementations

== XML-based Communications ==

 * [http://pyxmpp.jajcus.net/ PyXMPP] - a Python XMPP (RFC 3920,3921) and [http://www.jabber.org/protocol/ Jabber] implementation
 * [http://jabberpy.sourceforge.net/ jabber.py] - a Python module for the jabber instant messaging protocol
