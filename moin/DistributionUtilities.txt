= Distribution Utilities =

General distribution of Python code is typically done using the [[Distutils|Distutils]] package from the standard library which can produce source and binary distributions which depend on end-users having Python already installed on their computer. Such distributions are frequently available as operating system packages (a more general form of the term "package" referring not just to code but also to documentation, resources and other things) and can be installed using the package management infrastructure employed by various operating systems - see "System Package Distribution" below.

== Installers ==

The following are projects which support the production of installers or stand-alone executables.

 * [[cx Freeze]]
 * [[http://effbot.org/zone/exemaker.htm|ExeMaker]] - Creates EXE loaders for Python scripts (for Windows)
 * [[Freeze]] & [[Py2Exe|py2exe]] - building executables for Unix & Windows
 * [[http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php|Inno Setup]] - use to wrap up the output of the above into a Windows exe
 * MacPython BundleBuilder (Mac OS X)
 * [[http://davidf.sjsoft.com/mirrors/mcmillan-inc/install1.html|McMillan's Installer]] - includes notes about (other) distributing solutions
 * [[http://undefined.org/python/#py2app|py2app]] - Converts Python scripts into executable Mac OS X applications

== System Package Distribution ==

Although [[Distutils|Distutils]] supports the production of some system packages, other tools exist to make such packages:

 * [[http://www.showmedo.com/videos/video?name=linuxJensMakingDeb&fromSeriesID=37|ShowMeDo video]] (and wiki) on how to create a Debian package (.deb) from a python program (.py). This is useful if you want to distribute to Debian based Linux Systems like [[http://www.debian.org|Debian]] or [[http://www.ubuntulinux.com|Ubuntu]].
