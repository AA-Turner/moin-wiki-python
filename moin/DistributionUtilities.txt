= Distribution Utilities =

General distribution of Python code is typically done using the [[Distutils]] package from the standard library which can produce source and binary distributions which depend on end-users having Python already installed on their computer (with Python Eggs being a form of software distribution provided by the [[Distutils]] derivative, [[setuptools]]). Such source and binary software distributions are frequently available as operating system packages (a more general form of the term "package" referring not just to code but also to documentation, resources and other things) and can be installed using the package management infrastructure employed by various operating systems - see "System Package Distribution" below.

== Executable Applications ==
The following projects support the production of executable application from Python scripts.

== Installers ==

Installers are sometimes needed to wrap up the output of freeze tools into packages:

 * [[http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php|Inno Setup]] (Windows)
 * [[http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page|NSIS]] (Windows)
 * MacPython BundleBuilder (Mac OS X)

== System Package Distribution ==

Although [[Distutils|Distutils]] supports the production of some system packages, other tools exist to make such packages:

 * [[http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=linuxJensMakingDeb&fromSeriesID=37|ShowMeDo video]] (and wiki) on how to create a Debian package (.deb) from a python program (.py). This is useful if you want to distribute to Debian based Linux Systems like [[http://www.debian.org|Debian]] or [[http://www.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu]].

== Distribution Using Virtualisation ==

It is possible to distribute entire systems which can then be run under virtualisation or as "live CD" environments. Some solutions attempt to incorporate such approaches in a way which is transparent to the user:
