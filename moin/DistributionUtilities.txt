= Distribution Utilities =

Tools for distributing Python software:

== General Package Distribution ==

General distribution of Python code is typically done using the [wiki:DistUtils distutils] package from the standard library which can produce source and binary distributions which depend on end-users having Python already installed on their computer.

== Installers ==

The following are projects which support the production of installers or stand-alone executables.

 * ["cx_Freeze"]
 * [http://effbot.org/zone/exemaker.htm ExeMaker] - Creates EXE loaders for Python scripts (for Windows)
 * ["Freeze"] & [wiki:Py2Exe py2exe] - building executables for Unix & Windows
 * [http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php Inno Setup] - use to wrap up the output of the above into a Windows exe
 * MacPython BundleBuilder (Mac OS X)
 * [http://davidf.sjsoft.com/mirrors/mcmillan-inc/install1.html McMillan's Installer]
 * [http://undefined.org/python/#py2app py2app] - Converts Python scripts into executable Mac OS X applications

== System Package Distribution ==

Although [wiki:DistUtils distutils] supports the production of some system packages, other tools exist to make such packages:

 * [http://www.showmedo.com/videos/video?name=linuxJensMakingDeb&fromSeriesID=37 ShowMeDo video] (and wiki) on how to create a Debian package (.deb) from a python program (.py). This is useful if you want to distribute to Debian based Linux Systems like [http://www.debian.org Debian] or [http://www.ubuntulinux.com Ubuntu].
