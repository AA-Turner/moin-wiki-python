IronPython is [http://hugunin.net/index.html JimHugunin's] early-stage prototype implementation of Python on the .NET CLR.  

Early results are promising, but as of March 2004, there have been no further updates since Jim's end-of-2003 post announcing preliminary results: http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/ironpython

These results were quite promising, showing great performance, even better than CPython 2.3 on the Pystone benchmark, but remember this is an early prototype, not a full implementation.

These results caused a flurry of discussion, which has since died down, pending more information from Jim.
