IronPython is [http://hugunin.net/index.html JimHugunin's] implementation of Python on the .NET CLR.

You can download IronPython from http://ironpython.com/

Early results are promising, showing great performance, even better than CPython 2.3 on the Pystone benchmark, but remember this is an early prototype, not a full implementation.

These results caused a flurry of discussion, which has since died down, pending more information from Jim.

Some other Python-like languages for .NET and Mono include:
 * [http://boo.codehaus.org/ boo] - Syntax is very similar to Python's, yet the language is compiled.  It implements many features that have been suggested for ["Python3.0"], including a "with" statement and optional static typing, as well as closures and soon, optional case-insensitivity.  See [http://boo.codehaus.org/Gotchas+for+Python+Users Gotchas for Python Users] for specific comparisons to CPython.
 * [http://www.prothon.org/ Prothon] - now defunct
