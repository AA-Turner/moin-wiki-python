== Inroduction ==
Python 3 Supports Non-ASCII Identifiers as per [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/|PEP 3131]]. But this support is incomplete for  certain languages where special characters such as ZWJ, ZWNJ are used extensively. Example for such languages are Malayalam, Kannada, Sinhala, Farsi etc.

== Unicode standard on Using ZWJ/ZWNJ etc in Identifiers ==
ZWJ and ZWNJ are format control characters and unicode defines the usage of these characters in identifiers in [[http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters| TR31 in section 2.3  Layout and Format Control Characters]]


== Affected Languages ==
 * Malayalam
 * Kannada
 * Bengali
 * Farsi
 * Sinhala
