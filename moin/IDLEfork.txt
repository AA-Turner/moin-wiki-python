"just like [[IDLE]], only crunchy"

The IDLEfork project is an official experimental development fork of Python's small, light, 'bundled' integrated development environment, [[IDLE]]. It has been merged back into Python 2.3.

As of June 2003, the IDLEfork code base was merged back into Python, and the IDLEfork project went into bugfix mode. More details can be found at [http://idlefork.sourceforge.net/]
