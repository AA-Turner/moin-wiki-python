"just like [[IDLE]], only crunchy"

The IDLEfork project has been completed.  Since Python 2.3, [[IDLE]] should be used instead of IDLEfork.

The IDLEfork project is an official experimental development fork of Python's small, light, 'bundled' integrated development environment, [[IDLE]].  In June 2003, the IDLEfork code base was merged back into Python 2.3.  More details can be found at [http://idlefork.sourceforge.net/].
