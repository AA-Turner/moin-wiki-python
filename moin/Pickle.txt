= Should I use Pickle? =

Of course not.

 * It is insecure. Untrusted pickles can do arbitrary things. For example, this pickle executes arbitrary Python expressions: `pickle.loads("c__builtin__\neval\n(c__builtin__\nraw_input\n(S'py> '\ntRtR.")`

 * It is Python-only: pickles cannot be loaded in any other programming language / environment.

 * It is schemaless (may be seen as a benefit sometimes)
