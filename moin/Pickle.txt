= What is Pickle? =

= Should I use Pickle? =

Of course not.

 * It is insecure. Untrusted pickles can do arbitrary things. For example, this pickle executes arbitrary Python expressions: `pickle.loads("c__builtin__\neval\n(c__builtin__\nraw_input\n(S'py> '\ntRtR.")`

 * It is Python-only: pickles cannot be loaded in any other programming language / environment.

 * It is schemaless and opaque. See: http://bpaste.net/show/d0UZUSsAHtekA0pDiQzu/

= Alternatives =

 * The json module (http://docs.python.org/library/json.html) can handle dicts, lists, ints, floats, strings, booleans, and None. It cannot handle reference cycles, however. (pickle can.)
 * PyYAML (http://pyyaml.org/) can handle everything json can, as well as having comments inside source data, and reference cycles. However, it defaults to an unsafe pickle-like loader.
