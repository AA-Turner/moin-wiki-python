This is a list of the Roles that Jacob Hall√©n and Laura Creighton came up with that is necessary in order to run EuroPython.
We have undoubtably forgot some.  Feel free to add to this list.  Please don't delete things without discussion on the europython-improve mailing list `(info) <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython-improve>`_.

Roles for next Europython
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

These are the roles I see in the organisation of Europython. It is
quite possible for one person to have several roles, but the more
distributed the jobs get, the easier it will be to get each one done
well.

With full distribution, we would require about 25 people, plus track
chairs (about 8) and registration desk staff (about 10). Some jobs,
like the website editor, the sponsor recruiter and the registration
manager require quite a bit of time, while others are quite limited in
scope.
