   version:: 2.2.5 (''[[Date(2006-05-14T15:00:00Z)]]'')
   licence:: BSD
   platforms:: any platform that supports Python 2.3
   Python versions:: 2.3

=== Deployment Platforms ===

No requirement besides Python : Karrigell is provided with a web server and a Python database engine (KirbyBase). It can also run behind Apache, LighTPD and Xitami

=== Suitability ===

Web programming

Demos included in the distribution include a Wiki server, Kwiki (a sort of Wiki, but with the wysiwyg editor FCKEditor), a forum, a calendar, an interface for script internationalization, and a portal with user login/logout, personalization and news editing

=== Development Interfaces ===

Servlet-style : the scripts, either pure Python or mixing HTML and Python, are executed in a namespace which provides all useful information, including HTTP headers, authentication data, etc. For instance, form fields are available as the QUERY dictionary, or with a variable with a leading underscore (the field myField is available as _myField, either a string or a list depending on the field type)

The namespace also provides custom exceptions to stop its execution, such as HTTP_REDIRECTION (see the on-line documentation)

A function Include(script_or_file, **args) allows the inclusion of an html file or of a file inside a script. If script B is included inside script A, it is executed in script A's namespace ; additional **args can be added to this namespace

=== Environment Access ===

Standard Python mechanisms : environment data is available in the namespace where scripts are executed

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

Provided through functions available in scripts

Session() returns a session object, to which attributes can be set (arbitrary Python objects : user login, database connexion and cursor, etc.)

Basic HTTP authentication is available with Authentication(''testFunction''[,''realm,errorMessage'']) where testFunction is a user-defined function taking no argument, which returns true if the authentication test succeeds (depending on the values of AUTH_USER and AUTH_PASSWORD) and false otherwise

=== Persistence Support ===

Karrigell is provided with the pure-Python KirbyBase database engine

It can be linked to all databases for which there is a Python API (mySql, Post''''''Gres, etc)

=== Presentation Support ===

 * Python scripts, where the "print" statement is used to send output to the client

 * "Karrigell services" : Python scripts where functions are mapped to URLs (allows to build a whole site with just one script)

 * "Python Inside HTML" (PIH) which looks like PHP, ASP, etc : HTML code with Python code inserted inside <% and %>, with shortcuts for variables : <%= myVar %> and for translated strings which use the gettext mechanism (for which Karrigell provides a simple interface) : <%_ "string to translate" %>

 * "HTML Inside Python" which are Python scripts, except that the lines beginning with a string are sent to standard output as if there were a "print" statement before

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Karrigell aims at simplicity for web developers : 
	* no separate web server
	* no separate database (KirbyBase is included), although users can link to any base they like provided there is a Python API for it
	* a namespace for Python scripts in which developers will find all useful data and functions for the most ordinary tasks
	* a way to nest pages and scripts with the Include() function

The inspirations were EasyPHP, a package which provides Apache, PHP, mySql and PHPmy''''''Admin all in one, and saves the pain of installing each of them and make them all work together ; the wittily named Poor Man's Zope (PMZ) which showed how easy it was to make Python servlets (unfortunately unmaintained) ; and the pleasure I have programming things in Python

Performance and stability have been very much improved since the first versions. Karrigell can now be safely used in production environments
