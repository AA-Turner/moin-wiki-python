URL:: http://www.karrigell.com

version::3.1 (''<<Date(2010-04-25T15:00:00Z)>>'')

licence::BSD revised

platforms::any platform that supports Python 2.3

Python versions::2.3 and above

=== Deployment Platforms ===

No requirement besides Python : Karrigell is provided with a web server and a Python database engine ([[PyDbLite]]). It can also run behind Apache (CGI mode or mod_python) an any web server that supports proxy mode

=== Suitability ===

Web programming with all the usual tasks (session management, cookies, user management, etc)


=== Development Interfaces ===

Servlet-style : the scripts, either pure Python or mixing HTML and Python, are executed in a namespace which provides all useful information, including HTTP headers, authentication data, etc. For instance, form fields are available as the REQUEST dictionary, or with a variable available in the namespace

The namespace also provides custom exceptions to stop its execution, such as HTTP_REDIRECTION (see the on-line documentation)

A function Include(script_or_file, **args) allows the inclusion of an html file or of a file inside a script. If script B is included inside script A, it is executed in script A's namespace ; additional **args can be added to this namespace

=== Environment Access ===

Standard Python mechanisms : environment data is available in the namespace where scripts are executed

=== Session, Identification and Authentication ===

Provided through functions available in scripts

Session() returns a session object, to which attributes can be set (arbitrary Python objects : user login, database connexion and cursor, etc.)

A user management framework allows the site administrator to manage a user database with roles(admin, editor, visitor). In scripts, function Login(role) checks if the user is logged in with the specified role, or redirects to an authentication script ; Role() returns user's role

=== Persistence Support ===

Karrigell is provided with the pure-Python [[PyDbLite]] database engine. It can be linked to all databases for which there is a Python API (SQLite, MySQL, Post''''''Gres, etc)

=== Presentation Support ===

 * Python scripts, where the "print" statement is used to send output to the client

 * "Karrigell services" : Python scripts where functions are mapped to URLs (allows to build a whole site with just one script)

 * "Python Inside HTML" (PIH) which looks like PHP, ASP, etc : HTML code with Python code inserted inside <% and %>, with shortcuts for variables : <%= myVar %> and for translated strings which use the gettext mechanism (for which Karrigell provides a simple interface) : <%_ "string to translate" %>

 * "HTML Inside Python" which are Python scripts, except that the lines beginning with a string are sent to standard output as if there were a "print" statement before

 * plain CGI scripts, running much faster than usual because the interpreter is not loaded for each request

=== InTheirOwnWords ===

Karrigell aims at simplicity for web developers : 
	* a built-in web server, interfaces to run behind Apache
       * no configuration needed to get started ; on Windows, an installer allows running an application from an USB drive, even on PCs without Python installed
	* a namespace for Python scripts in which developers will find all useful data and functions for the most ordinary tasks
	* a way to nest pages and scripts with the Include() function

The inspirations were EasyPHP, a package which provides Apache, PHP, mySql and PHPmy''''''Admin all in one, and saves the pain of installing each of them and make them all work together ; the wittily named Poor Man's Zope (PMZ) which showed how easy it was to make Python servlets (unfortunately unmaintained) ; and the pleasure I have programming things in Python

Performance and stability have been very much improved since the first versions. Karrigell can now be safely used in production environments

=== Hosting ===
[[http://www.webfaction.com|WebFaction]] supports Karrigell

All web hosts using Apache and allowing CGI scripts can support it
