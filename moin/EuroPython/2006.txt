EuroPython 2006 will be held at [http://www.cern.ch CERN] near Geneva in Switzerland from Monday 3 July to Wednesday 5 July 2006. Sprints are planned to be run from 30 June to 2 July and 6 July to 9 July.

The conference organization is still very much in its beginnings.  The plan is to use this area to share information, plans and ideas.  If you are merely interested in attending the conference, this might not be the right place for you -- unless you want to become involved in helping out with the organization of the conference as well, something that is definitely encouraged!

The ''centre of all things'' of EuroPython is the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython mailing list].

 * /IrcMeetings -- we (will) have meetings on the #europython channel on freenode.
 * ["/People"] -- people involved somewhat in organizing the conference.
 * /TrackDescriptions -- a place for track chairs to put descriptions of their tracks.
 * /PublicRelations2006 -- a place to dicuss the marketing

## * ["/CallForProposals"] -- a draft.
## * ["/FirstAnnouncement"] -- another draft.
