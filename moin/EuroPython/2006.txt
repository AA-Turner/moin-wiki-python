EuroPython 2006 will be held at [http://www.cern.ch CERN] near Geneva in Switzerland from Monday 3 July to Wednesday 5 July 2006. Sprints are planned for 30 June to 2 July and 6 July to 9 July.

The conference organization is still very much in its beginnings.  The plan is to use this area to share information, plans and ideas.

 * /IrcMeetings -- we (will) have meetings on the #europython channel on freenode.
 * ["/People"] -- people involved somewhat in organizing the conference.
