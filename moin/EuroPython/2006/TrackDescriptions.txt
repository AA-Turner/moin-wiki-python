Hopefully very soon, we'll send out a call for papers.  This should describe each track.  If you're a track chair, please put some nice text here.

 * Refereed Papers -- ''Armin Rigo, Carl Friedrich Bolz''

 * Agile Development -- ''Holger Krekel, Bea DÃ¼ring''

 * Social Skills -- ''Beatrice Fontaine, Aiste Kesminaite''

 * Science -- ''Nicolas Chauvat''

 * Web Frameworks -- ''Paul Everitt, Godefroid Chapelle''

 * Python Language and Libraries -- ''Samuele Pedroni''

   A track about Python the Language, all batteries included. Talks about
   the language, language evolution, patterns and idioms, implementations
   (CPython, IronPython, Jython, PyPy ...) and implementation issues
   belong to the track. So do talks about the standard library or
   interesting 3rd-party libraries (and frameworks), unless the gravitational
   pull of other tracks is stronger.


 * Business and Applications -- ''John Pinner, Harald Armin Massa''

   This is where Europython thinks outside our Python community - about the applications
   we have written for ordinary people and businesses, and about how we've sold them to the
   outside world.

    * What Python apps have you written? Tell your fellow Pythonistas about them. Exchange knowledge and maybe gain new business partners.
    * How do you sell your apps and services into the business community?
    * What strategies have you used to convince potential customers and what works for you? Come to think of it, what doesn't work?
    * How do you license your apps? Do you use a Free Software licence or is your application proprietary? Tell us what path you have chosen and why.
    * What have you learnt about introducing new technology into userland?
    * Share your experiences with the community and go home enthuiastic and enlightened.
    * At previous Europythons we have heard about applications as diverse as indexing and searching the US patent database, and payroll. We have had panels on software patents (more work to do yet, I'm afraid) and licensing.

   If you have any questions about how you can contibute to this track, please contact the Track Chair, John Pinner ( john (AT) clocksoft.com ).

   But most of all, please send us your proposals for talks for the Applications and Business Track.

 * Education -- ''Aroldo Souza-Leite, Laura Creighton''

 * Games -- ''Michael Sparks''

 * Misfits -- ''Laura Creighton''
