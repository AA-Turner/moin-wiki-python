Hopefully very soon, we'll send out a call for papers.  This should describe each track.  If you're a track chair, please put some nice text here.

 * Refereed Papers -- ''Armin Rigo, Carl Friedrich Bolz''

 * Agile Development -- ''Holger Krekel, Bea DÃ¼ring''

 * Social Skills -- ''Beatrice Fontaine, Aiste Kesminaite''

 * Science -- ''Nicolas Chauvat''

 * Web Frameworks -- ''Paul Everitt, Godefroid Chapelle''

 * Python Language and Libraries -- ''Samuele Pedroni''

   A track about Python the Language, all batteries included. Talks about
   the language, language evolution, patterns and idioms, implementations
   (CPython, IronPython, Jython, PyPy ...) and implementation issues
   belong to the track. So do talks about the standard library or
   interesting 3rd-party libraries (and frameworks), unless the gravitational
   pull of other tracks is stronger.


 * Business and Applications -- ''John Pinner, Harald Armin Massa''

 * Education -- ''Aroldo Souza-Leite, Laura Creighton''

 * Games -- ''Michael Sparks''

 * Misfits -- ''Laura Creighton''
