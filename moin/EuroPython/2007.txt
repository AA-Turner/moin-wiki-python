EuroPython 2007 will take place in Vilnius, Lithuania from Monday 9 July to Wednesday 11 July 2007. 

Sprints are on the page ["EuroPython2007Sprints"], for those of you looking in the wrong place. ;-)

If you merely attended the conference or are merely interested in attending future conferences, this might not be the right place for you -- unless you want to become involved in helping out with the organisation of future conferences as well: something that is definitely encouraged!

The ''centre of all things'' of EuroPython is the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython mailing list].

 * /IrcMeetings -- a record of meetings on the #europython channel on freenode.

 * /PublicRelations (["EuroPython/2006/PublicRelations2006"]) -- a place to discuss the marketing
