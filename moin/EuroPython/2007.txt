EuroPython 2007 will take place in Vilnius, Lithuania from Monday 9 July to Wednesday 11 July 2007. 

Sprints can take place.

If you merely attended the conference or are merely interested in attending future conferences, this might not be the right place for you -- unless you want to become involved in helping out with the organisation of future conferences as well: something that is definitely encouraged!

The ''centre of all things'' of EuroPython is the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython mailing list].
