== Agenda/Minutes ==

 * Registration/Budget - status as early registration end approaches - '''We're close to the early bird deadline, so we need to remind people to register.'''
 * Getting the logo cleared with the PSF - ''Laura was to contact the PSF. The PSF has responded to PyCon UK about their logo.'' - '''We're OK to use it.'''
 * Keynotes - confirmation of our speakers - ''Aiste was introduced to Hans. Biographical details plus announcement required.'' - '''Laura will get details from Hans. We should use these in adverts for the conference.'''
 * Talks - status report on submissions received and acceptance
 * Sponsorship
  * Brief discussion of the status of sponsors, incoming materials, and so on.
  * Further discussion of the sponsorship of attendees (plus any information that should be published).
 * T-shirts (as noted on [http://www.europython.org/community/T-Shirts this page])
 * Streaming and dedicated lines - ''We have to see what the traffic shaping is like. We need volunteers, too, so maybe it's time to use the europython-volunteer-announce list. The proposed licensing was controversial for some.''
* food -- check to see that things are being handled on that front
