== Agenda/Minutes ==

 * Registration/Budget - status as early registration end approaches
  * '''We're close to the early bird deadline, so we need to remind people to register.'''
  * '''We have 71 delegates so far, which is ahead of last year's figure at this point, but the early bird deadline was later last year.'''
 * Getting the logo cleared with the PSF - ''Laura was to contact the PSF. The PSF has responded to PyCon UK about their logo.'' - '''We're OK to use it.'''
 * Keynotes - confirmation of our speakers - ''Aiste was introduced to Hans. Biographical details plus announcement required.''
  * '''Laura will get details from Hans. We should use these in adverts for the conference.'''
  * '''There will be two keynotes on the Monday.'''
  * '''The streaming situation is in hand.'''
 * Talks - status report on submissions received and acceptance
  * '''We have around 47 talks submitted.'''
 * Sponsorship
