'''Introduction...'''

Trade show and becoming a sponsor and/or exhibitor:

== Exhibitor ==

1. You can have a small space for EUR 500. This includes a desk, a
chair and 2 meters of wall space. You get one electric outlet (standard European type) and access to the wireless network. You are not insured by the conference. At least one member of your organisation must be attending the conference, but you may staff
your booth with non-attendees.

2. You are required to keep your booth manned during the "trade
show". This will take place for a period of 6 hours. You can have your booth up manned or unmanned the rest of the time - it is up to each company to decide.

3. You can rent more space and equipment on the show floor. Prices
are close to "at cost". Contact the EuroPython organisers for an offer.

4. Depending on availability, it may also be possible to rent your own seminar room for demonstrations, private seminars, job interviews etc. Please contact the organisers for details and offers.
