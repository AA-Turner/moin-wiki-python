This year, EuroPython will take place from Monday 9th July to Wednesday 11th July in Vilnius, Lithuania. As the premier pan-European Python event, this is a great opportunity to reach dedicated users of Python in business and academia, as well as influential members of the Python community. Last year's conference was a great success, and we would like to offer you the chance to participate in this year's event as a sponsor or an exhibitor. With your support, your organisation can share in the success of EuroPython 2007: the sixth annual conference in the well established and highly regarded conference series for the European Python and Zope communities.

== Exhibitors ==

As an exhibitor the following terms and conditions apply:

 * You can have a small space for EUR 500. This includes a desk, a chair and 2 meters of wall space. You get one electric outlet (standard European type) and access to the wireless network. You are not insured by the conference. At least one member of your organisation must be attending the conference, but you may staff your booth with non-attendees.
 * You are required to keep your booth staffed during the "trade show". This will take place for a period of 6 hours. You can keep your booth staffed or left unattended the rest of the time - it is up to each exhibitor to decide.
