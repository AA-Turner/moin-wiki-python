Book Monday 9th of July to Wednesday 11th of July 2007 in your
calendar. EuroPython 2007, the European Python and Zope conference,
will this year be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Last years conference
was a great success - a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and
inspiring keynotes. So we invite you to contribute to help us make
EuroPython 2007 a proud successor of the previous five EuroPython
events arranged so far.

This year, we encourage talks in the following tracks and topics:

   Science/Refereed Papers
   Python Language and Libraries
   Web Frameworks
   Open Space

XXX mention Lightning talks here?

A new phenomenon in the EuroPython tradition is the Open Space track
(inspired by this years PyCon and last years Agile 2006 and XP 2006
conferences).

The Open Space track is aimed at informal and spontanious talks that
invite participants to gather and discuss various topics and
experiences. Topics that could fit the Open Space track would be Agile
Development, Business and Applications, Teaching, Games and
Entertainment and any other Python related experiences and insights
you feel would be interesting for others to listen to and discuss.
XXX sell this better - discussing/experience sharing is the main value

XXX any other specific theme for this years conference (last year it was science)???

XXX There will be a refereed papers track as well this year, which will be
announced separately. -----how to rewrite this science/refereed being joined..
