= EuroPython 2007: Call for Proposals =

Book Monday 9th of July to Wednesday 11th of July 2007 in your
calendar! EuroPython 2007, the European Python and Zope Conference,
will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Last year's conference
was a great success, featuring a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and inspiring keynotes.  But with your participation, we can make EuroPython 2007, the sixth EuroPython, even more successful than the previous five.

== Talks, Papers and Themes ==

This year we have decided to borrow a few good ideas from PyCon, one of which is to move away from the 'track' structure.  Instead, speakers are invited to submit presentations about anything they have done that they think would be of interest to the Python community.  We will then arrange them into related groups and schedule them in the space available.  In the past, EuroPython participants have found the following themes to be of interest:

 * Science
 * Python Language and Libraries
 * Web Related Technologies
 * Education
 * Games
 * Agile Methologies and Testing
 * Social Skills

In addition to talks, we will also accept full paper submissions about any of the above themes.  The Call for Refereed Papers will be posted shortly.

== Other ways of participating ==

Of course, there are other ways of participating in the conference than giving talks.  Just attending and talking to people you find here can be satisfying enough, but there are three more kinds of participation you may wish to plan for: Lightning Talks, Open Space and Sprints.  Lightning Talks are very short talks that give you just enough time to introduce a topic or project, Open Space is an area reserved for informal discussions and a Sprint is a focussed get together for developers interested in a particular project.

Discussion:

I used the word presentation rather than talk, because some people's talks are more like demos.  As long as we don't get 'This is my company.  Here is my product. Buy me.' I am fine with this.  If others are not, change presentation back to talk.

Presentation, talk, seminar - perhaps only the last one is less likely to be interpreted commercially, but it's not really appropriate here. I've tried to make the terminology mostly consistent, however. -- PaulBoddie

Another thing: the PyCon organisers were quite "up front" about making materials available under nice licences (see [http://groups.google.no/group/comp.lang.python.announce/msg/6494b73df65e5e98 their Call for Proposals]). EuroPython 2006 did very well in at least making materials available (the licensing was a bit vague), but how about adding a note about these issues? -- PaulBoddie

I took the liberty of fine-tuning the language a little. I almost wrote "touching up the language" after changing the part about developers "pairing off". ;-) -- DavidBoddie
