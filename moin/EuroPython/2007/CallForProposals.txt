= EuroPython 2007: Call for Proposals =

Book Monday 9th of July to Wednesday 11th of July 2007 in your
calendar! EuroPython 2007, the European Python and Zope Conference,
will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Last year's conference
was a great success, featuring a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and inspiring keynotes.  But with your participation, we can make EuroPython 2007, the sixth EuroPython, even more successful than the previous five.

== Talks, Papers and Themes ==

This year we have decided to borrow a few good ideas from PyCon.  The first idea is to move away from the 'track' structure.  Instead, speakers are invited to submit presentations about anything
they have done with Python that they think would be of interest to the Python community.  We will then arrange them into related groups and schedule them in the space available.  In the past, EuroPython participants have found the following themes to be of interest:

 * Science
 * Python Language and Libraries
 * Web Related Technologies
 * Education
 * Games
 * Agile Methologies and Testing
 * Social Skills

In addition to talks, we will also accept full paper submissions about any of the above themes.  The Call for Refereed Papers will be posted shortly.

== Lightning Talks ==

As usual we will be holding ''lightning talks''.  A lightning talk is a very short talk - five minutes maximum - scheduled in rapid succession, with as many as 10 lightning talks in a 60 minute session. There is no approval process: speakers merely sign up at the door. Topics are often up-and-coming Python projects, less well-known Python projects, cool hacks, things you wish were different, recruitment for a new sprint based on an idea you just had, war stories, and amusing mistakes.  If a topic is boring, or
incomprehensible, don't worry, it will be over in five minutes!

== Open Space ==

The second idea we have borrowed from PyCon (and from the Agile 2006 and XP 2006 conferences) is the concept of ''open space''.   Open space provides a structured way to realise the main benefits of attending a conference: breaking down barriers between special interest groups and encouraging the sharing of experiences with other attendees. Open space is an area reserved for informal presentations, talks, demonstrations and discussions. Like lightning talks, open space events are not planned in advance.
But unlike lightning talks, open space events are not plenary, have a much more generous time limit.  One could use them to...

 * meet with like-minded folk to discuss a problem you all have.  
 * show off that cool program you have been writing. 
 * have someone give their talk again, for those of us who missed it the first time, or have them clarify the parts you found confusing with a demonstration.

== Sprints ==

After the conference (from Thursday 12th July to Saturday 14th July) we will, as usual be holding sprints: sessions of collaborative development focused on creating or improving software projects, documentation, and other materials.  A sprint is a focused two- or three-day development session, in which a small group of developers pair off together in a room and focus on solving a particular problem or building a particular subsystem.  This gets the team focused around clear (and challenging) goals while working collaboratively. Not only do is this a great way of getting results, but also a great way to get new people aquinted with the codebase, and disseminate knowledge within the team.  Perhaps most important: it's fun!

Discussion:

I used the word presentation rather than talk, because some people's talks are more like demos.  As long as we don't get 'This is my company.  Here is my product. Buy me.' I am fine with this.  If others are not, change presentation back to talk.

Presentation, talk, seminar - perhaps only the last one is less likely to be interpreted commercially, but it's not really appropriate here. I've tried to make the terminology mostly consistent, however. -- PaulBoddie
