Book Monday 9th of July to Wednesday 11th of July 2007 in your
calendar. EuroPython 2007, the European Python and Zope Conference,
will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Last year's conference
was a great success, featuring a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and
inspiring keynotes.  But with your participation, we can make EuroPython 2007, the fifth EuroPython even more successful than the previous four.

This year, we have the following tracks planned:

   Science/Refereed Papers
   Python Language and Libraries
   Web Frameworks
   Education  (and everything else)
   Lightning Talks
   Open Space

After the conference we will, as usual, be holding Sprints.

Open Space is a new concept for EuroPython.  We've imported the idea from PyCon
and the Agile 2006 and XP 2006 conferences.  An Open Space is an area reserved
for informal presentations, talks, demonstrations and discussions.  Pretty much
anything is fair game.  Important to the concept is that things are not planned
in advance.  Instead, while at the conference, you reserve a time slot and
write down a title.  If you are familiar with Lightning Talks, then you can think
of OpenSpace as non-plenary Lightning talks without the time limit.

This provides a structured way to realise the main benefits of attending a conference:
sharing experiences with the other attendees.  

XXX sell this better - discussing/experience sharing is the main value  not sure what
to add.

announced separately. -----how to rewrite this science/refereed being joined..
XXX lac: Ah, why are we merging this?  Cannot write what I do not know.
XXX say that we are chosing to have fewer tracks this year.  To this end
XXX Science and Refereed have been merged.  And Education is now a big umbrella that

XXX schedule a talk in those subjects.  Or are we doing away with such things?
XXX hope not, lac
