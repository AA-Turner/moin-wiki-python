Book Monday 9th of July to Wednesday 11th of July 2007 in your
calendar. EuroPython 2007, the European Python and Zope Conference,
will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Last year's conference
was a great success, featuring a variety of tracks, amazing lightning talks and
inspiring keynotes.  But with your participation, we can make EuroPython 2007, the fifth EuroPython even more successful than the previous four.

This year, we have the following tracks planned:

   Science/Refereed Papers
   Python Language and Libraries
   Web Frameworks
   Lightning Talks
   Open Space

After the conference we will, as usual, be holding Sprints.

XXX for a list of sprints already proposed?



A new phenomenon in the EuroPython tradition is the Open Space track
(inspired by this years PyCon and last years Agile 2006 and XP 2006
conferences).  XXX lac -- if you reserve space in advance, then though its
not a talk, its not OpenSpace?? We need a different name, I  think.
One that allows demos and things that are not talks.  I would call it

Not-Necessarily-A-Talks, but then that is me.

The Open Space track is aimed at informal and spontanious talks that
invite participants to gather and discuss various topics and
experiences. Topics that could fit the Open Space track would be Agile
Development, Business and Applications, Teaching, Games and
Entertainment and any other Python related experiences and insights
you feel would be interesting for others to listen to and discuss.
XXX sell this better - discussing/experience sharing is the main value

XXX There will be a refereed papers track as well this year, which will be
announced separately. -----how to rewrite this science/refereed being joined..
XXX lac: Ah, why are we merging this?  Cannot write what I do not know.
