= IRC Meeting #6 =

== Time/Location ==

The meeting will take place on Monday 16th of April (2007-04-16) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. ''That's 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.'' The suggested duration of the meeting is at most ''one hour''.

== Minutes ==

 * Aiste will upload a hotel registration form for attendees into CPS.
 * People will collaborate on the mailing list or via program at europython.org on the missing theme descriptions.
 * Promotion:
   * europython-announce now carries the Call For Proposals.
   * Nicolas will take up contact with ZEA in order to promote the conference in the Zope community; Python411 has been notified; David will get a template from The Python Papers and attempt to submit the article for the next edition; Aiste has issued the announcement to at least some Russian language communities.
 * Sponsorship:
   * Google have been contacted, but may be contacted again by Michael.
   * No additional ideas were provided for sponsorship packages, although it was suggested that the [http://www.europython.org/workspaces/ep-2007/sponsorship existing text] could be revised to emphasise Web banner sponsorship, with programme sponsorship not mentioned but possibly replaced with other "attendee bag" advertising.
   * Nicolas was going to look at the financial plan to get ideas of sponsorship rates. A general idea of budgetary constraints is needed: attendee rates should be decided, too.
   * Attendee materials/packages/bags could be produced, according to Aiste, but this is dependent on sponsorship demand and organiser interest: quotes for printing can only be sought if we know what we want to produce. Nicolas thought that some kind of programme might be useful.

== Agenda ==

Suggestions:

 * Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: "education" and "social skills" are missing; "agile" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.
 * Promotion:
   * Status of europython-announce.
   * Status of contacts: ZEA (Bea), Python411 (David), Python Papers article, Russian translation (Aiste).
 * Sponsorship:
   * Contact points: revitalising the europython-sponsorship mailing list and providing a sponsorship at europython.org address.
   * Web banners!
   * Participation of Google, other previous sponsors (Benedikt or Michael).
   * Ideas about sponsorship packages/levels, rates, facilities: see [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-April/006307.html Aiste's message] for details.
 * Opening times: see [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-April/006307.html Aiste's message] for details.
 * What materials will be given to attendees? At CERN, it was vital to give people maps and site information (as well as badges). See [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-February/006226.html this message about The Python Papers] on the topic of "bag inserts".
