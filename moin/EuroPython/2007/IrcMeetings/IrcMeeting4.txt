= IRC Meeting #4 =

== Time/Location ==

The meeting will ''probably'' take place on Wednesday 28th of March (2007-03-21) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. ''That's 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.''

== Agenda ==

No agenda yet. Suggestions:

 * Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: "education" and "social skills" are missing; "agile" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.
 * Promotion: python.org needs to pick up the CFP announcement and other channels should be involved. See [[PyCon2007/Feedback]] for interesting avenues, notably mailing lists for other Python-related and Free Software projects.
