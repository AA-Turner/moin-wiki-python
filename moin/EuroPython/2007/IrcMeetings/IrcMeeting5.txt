= IRC Meeting #5 =

== Time/Location ==

The meeting will take place on Monday 2nd of April (2007-04-02) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. ''That's 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.''

== Agenda ==

No agenda yet. Suggestions:

 * Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: "education" and "social skills" are missing; "agile" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.
 * Promotion: we're on python.org now, but what other channels should be involved? See ["EuroPython/2007/PublicRelations"] for interesting avenues, along with some materials used by the PyCon organisers.
 * Sponsorship. Any motion here?
   * EuroPython sponsorship has become fairly unobtrusive: Web site banners, some promotional activity at the conference.
   * In contrast, PyCon has maintained the previous "sophisticated" sponsorship plans: http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HowToSponsor
   * Some resistance to promotional keynotes and lightning talks is detectable in the PyCon feedback: ["PyCon2007/Feedback/Comments"]
   * Perhaps a dialogue with potential sponsors is better than the usual bronze/silver/gold categories.
