== Time/Location ==

The meeting will take place on Monday 2nd of April (2007-04-02) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. ''That's 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.''

== Agenda ==

No agenda yet. Suggestions:

 * Finishing the theme descriptions in Indico: "education" and "social skills" are missing; "agile" needs reviewing; suggestions welcome about the others.
 * Promotion: we're on python.org now, but what other channels should be involved? See ["PyCon2007/Feedback"] for interesting avenues, notably mailing lists for other Python-related and Free Software projects.
 * Sponsorship.  Any motion here?
