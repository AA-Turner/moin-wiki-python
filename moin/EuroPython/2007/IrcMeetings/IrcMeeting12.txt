= IRC Meeting #12 =

== Time/Location ==

The meeting will take place on Monday 28th May (2007-05-28) 18:00 CEST (17:00 BST, 16:00 UTC/GMT) in the #europython channel on freenode.net. ''That's 5pm UK time, 6pm in most of Western Europe.'' The suggested duration of the meeting is at most ''one hour''.

== Minutes ==

 * Bea discussed the idea of inviting people to enhance the open space experience at the conference, as suggested [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2007-May/006403.html in a message to the europython mailing list].
   * The response was generally positive, so she will pursue one contact to make a proposal in order to get PSF funding for travel and accommodation costs. The program chairs will deal with this.
   * Bea and others will look around for other likely candidates for this purpose. Bea suggested Jim Hugunin, David suggested Brett Cannon and the Jython people, Paul suggested some GNOME people.
 * David clarified the situation regarding Simon Willison's accommodation, and Michael sent a reminder to Guido to make sure he has somewhere to stay. Laura will receive the reimbursement claims.
 * We looked at the talk situation and felt that some areas/themes were underrepresented. The programme will be finalised a little later than planned while some of the organisers finish other work. We can try to get a partial programme released for the original deadline.
 * The WorldPay application process is still ongoing.
 * Sponsorship options were discussed:
   * Paul mailed Laura and Dario about sponsorship proposals that need to be processed.
 * Next week's meeting will focus on the programme, but may also cover any other issues that arise. Information about any meetings that take place will be posted to [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/europython the mailing list].
