After the conference (from Thursday 12th July to Saturday 14th July) we will, as usual, be holding sprints: sessions of collaborative development focused on creating or improving software projects, documentation, and other materials.  A sprint is a focused two- or three-day development session, in which a small group of developers gather together in a room and focus on solving a particular problem or building a particular subsystem.  This gets the team focused around clear (and challenging) goals while working collaboratively. Not only is this a great way of getting results, but also a great way to get new people acquainted with a project's codebase and disseminate knowledge within the team.  Perhaps most importantly: it's fun!
