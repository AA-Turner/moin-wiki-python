= EuroPython 2007: Call for Sponsors =

This year, EuroPython will take place from Monday 9th July to Wednesday 11th July in Vilnius, Lithuania. As the premier pan-European Python event, this is a great opportunity to reach dedicated users of Python in business and academia, as well as influential members of the Python community. Last year's conference was a great success, and we would like to offer you the chance to participate in this year's event as a sponsor or an exhibitor. With your support, your organisation can share in the success of EuroPython 2007: the sixth annual conference in the well established and highly regarded conference series for the European Python and Zope communities.

Details of sponsor opportunities can be found on the EuroPython site at the following location:

For planning purposes in connection with the programme, we need your decision to participate no later than the end of the working day on Friday 8th June (18:00 Central European Time). Participation after this date is still possible, but with reduced benefits for sponsors.
