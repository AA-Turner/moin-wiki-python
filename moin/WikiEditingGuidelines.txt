 * Be helpful: The ultimate test is to ask whether your wiki modifications provide real value to a reader. Examples of value are: give helpful resource, fix errors, make sentences shorter and more concise, make text readable, restructure. 
 * Be friendly: Make the wiki a friendly place that the community likes to revisit again and again.
 * Be cautious: The wiki is visited by millions of Python coders. Respect the impact of each little entry - don't write half-baked content in the wiki.
