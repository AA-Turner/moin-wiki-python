== Assigned duties for PyCon 2004 ==

This is a list of PyCon tasks that need someone to be in charge of.  The
responsible person should of course feel free to draft other people;
you're just making a commitment to ensure that the work gets done.

The tasks are listed roughly in descending order of Aahz's opinion of
critical path for getting PyCon to work.  Items with parentheses are
those which have not yet gotten a commitment for DC 2004; those with
names in parentheses are those which had that person in charge for 2003.
