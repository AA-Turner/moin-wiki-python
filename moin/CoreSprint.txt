== PyConDC 2004 Core Sprint plan ==

Some ideas:

 * Complete the implementation of Generator Expressions

 * Add a module of statistical and reduction functions:  stddev, average,
 nlargest, nsmallest, product, etc.

 * Complete the Decimal module

 * Reduce python's start-up time.

 * Python bug fixing sprint

 * PythonASTSprint -- finish the new compiler on the ast-branch -- this
 should be a top priority because the project has been open for so long.

 * Examine optimizations proposed by Neal Norwitz and Michael Hudson

   + Add 2 custom op-codes for CALL_FUNCTION where the number of
   arguments is known in advance

   + Have the interpreter just handle code strings instead of arbitrary
     objects with a file interface (all large systems are paying a cost
     for an unused small system feature)

 * Add 'diff3' and 'patch' to difflib

 * Unify doctest's two approaches to finding test cases.

 * Documentation sprint

    + People liked the examples in the docs for unittest, sets, and
    itertools.  Apply that model to other parts of the docs.  For
    instance, the email and logging packages would be a lot easier to use
    if there were a semi-comprehensive example section in the docs.

    + document the smtpd module

    + document the platform module

 * Improve the byte code optimizer.  Several new transformations can be
 added after checking for basic blocks  and if the jump targets can be
 fixed up when the total number of bytes changes.  Also, the line
 numbering has to be kept intact during the transformations.

 * Update, pare-down, and clean-up Demo and Tools/Scripts

 * Guido to practice throwing pies.
