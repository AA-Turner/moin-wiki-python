= Keeping Lists in Dictionaries =

Here's a cute technique I saw, for keeping lists inside dictionaries.

If you have a dictionary with list values, you can run into a
problem when you need to add an item to a list value- ''does
the list already exist?''

Usually, we write it out like so:
{{{
#!python
def add_value_to_keys_list(dict_, key, value):
    if not dict_.has_key(key):
        dict_[key] = [value]  # Construct list
    else:
        dict_[key].append(value)  # Append to list
}}}

This is okay, but we can do even better!

{{{
#!python
def add_value_to_keys_list(dict_, key, value):
    dict_.setdefault(key, []).append(value)
}}}

How does it work?

{{{.setdefault}}} works like {{{.get}}}, except that
when the item isn't found, the default isn't only
''returned,'' but they key is ''set'' to the
default as well.

So, in effect, the line means, "Look in the dictionary
for the key. If it's ''there,'' return it's associate.
If it's ''not there,'' set it's associate to {{{[]}}},
and ''then'' return it's new associate. The associate
is (surprise, surprise) - a ''list.'' Now, append
the value to the list."

Cute!
