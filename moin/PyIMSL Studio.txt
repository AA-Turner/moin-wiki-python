PyIMSL Studio from Rogue Wave Software is the only commercially-available numerical analysis application development environment designed for deploying mathematics and statistics prototype models into production applications. PyIMSL Studio closes the prototype to production gap by providing modelers and implementation teams with a common set of tested and supported high-quality development tools as well as the same underlying numerical algorithms. Using PyIMSL Studio, prototype work is transformed into production applications faster and with less complexity, cost and risk.

PyIMSL Studio contains both open source and proprietary components that create a fully supported and documented platform for analytic prototyping and production development.

    *  For prototyping, a number of open source tools and commercial components from Rogue Wave Software are available for Python, including [[PyIMSL]] Python wrappers to the mathematics and statistics algorithms in the IMSL C Library. This combination of tools provides a rich environment for prototype development.
    * For production deployment, the commercial version of PyIMSL Studio includes the IMSL C Library. Other I/O and data filtering components are available in both Python and C to further support deployment. Using the IMSL C Library provides parity between prototype and production code.

PyIMSL Studio is available for download at no charge for non-commercial use or for commercial evaluation.
