 * Flexible [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/layout.html layout managers]
 * Standard [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-mainwindow.html GUI features for applications] (menus, toolbars, dock windows)
 * Easy communication between application components (signals and slots)
 * A [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qpainter.html unified painting system] with transparency, anti-aliasing, OpenGL integration and SVG support
 * Internationalization (i18n) support and integration with the [http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/features/internationalization Qt Linguist] translation tool
 * [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-scribe.html Rich text processing], display and printing facilities, including support for PDF export (Qt 4.1 and later)
 * Database support (SQL) and model/view features
 * [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/threads.html Threading classes], providing abstractions for threads, mutexes and semaphores

 * Inter-process communication for Unix via D-Bus message buses (Qt 4.2 and later)
 * Text completion and undo frameworks (Qt 4.2 and later)
 * XML handling APIs, including SAX, DOM and (from Qt 4.3 onwards) a stream-oriented API
 * An [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtscript.html ECMAScript interpreter] with the ability to access Qt's object model

== Documentation and Learning Materials ==

[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html Comprehensive documentation] is available for PyQt4 which includes detailed [http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html class and function documentation].

[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki The PyQt and PyKDE Community Wiki] aims to provide tutorials and sample code for PyQt4.

An [http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=33&sessionId=41&confId=44 overview of PyQt4] was presented at EuroPython 2006.

An introduction to using [http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Creating_GUI_Applications_with_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer PyQt4 with Qt Designer] for the development of GUI applications was given at [http://www.pyconuk.org PyCon UK 2007].

The book
[http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt] is PyQt4-specific and covers development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3.

Installation instructions for PyQt 4.1 on Windows with MinGW is available at [http://iwiwdsmi.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-to-install-pyqt-41-python-25-and-qt_8340.html]
