== About PyQt4 ==

'''The contents of this page should probably be merged with the PyQt page and this page made to redirect there.'''

PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for [[http://qt.nokia.com|Qt 4]] that are dual-licensed under the GPL (version 2 and 3, with additional license exceptions) and a commercial license.
There is also !PySide by Nokia - new alternative bindings (as of November 2009) with LGPL license that struggle to be API compatible (at least until Qt 4.6) with PyQt4.

PyQt4 exposes much of the functionality of Qt 4 to Python, including:

 * A comprehensive set of [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/gallery.html|widgets]]
 * Flexible [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/layout.html|layout managers]]
 * Standard [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-mainwindow.html|GUI features for applications]] (menus, toolbars, dock windows)
 * Easy communication between application components (signals and slots)
 * A [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qpainter.html|unified painting system]] with transparency, anti-aliasing, OpenGL integration and SVG support
 * Internationalization (i18n) support and integration with the [[http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/features/internationalization|Qt Linguist]] translation tool
 * [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-scribe.html|Rich text processing]], display and printing facilities, including support for PDF export (Qt 4.1 and later)
 * Database support (SQL) and model/view features
 * [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/threads.html|Threading classes]], providing abstractions for threads, mutexes and semaphores
 * Integrated resource handling for applications
 * Widget styles, including support for [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/stylesheet.html|widget stylesheets]] (from Qt 4.2 onwards)
 * Input/output and networking
   * Qt 4.3 and later supports Secure Sockets Layer communications
 * A powerful, feature-rich [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/graphicsview.html|graphics canvas]] (Qt 4.2 and later)
 * Inter-process communication for Unix via D-Bus message buses (Qt 4.2 and later)
 * Text completion and undo frameworks (Qt 4.2 and later)
 * XML handling APIs, including SAX, DOM and (from Qt 4.3 onwards) a stream-oriented API
   * Support for XML query technologies, such as [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qtxmlpatterns.html|XQuery, XPath]] and [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtxmlpatterns.html#xslt-2-0|XSLT]].
 * An [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtscript.html|ECMAScript interpreter]] with the ability to access Qt's object model
 * Support for [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qt4-designer.html|Qt Designer]], including facilities to add custom Python-based widgets to the standard set of Qt widgets available to user interface designers.
 * [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qtwebkit.html|WebKit browser engine integration]].
 * Support for [[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/phonon-overview.html|audio and video playback]].

== Documentation and Learning Materials ==

'''The PyQt4 tutorial''' available at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/

[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/l|Comprehensive documentation]] is available for PyQt4 which includes detailed [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html|class and function documentation]].

[[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki|The PyQt and PyKDE Community Wiki]] aims to provide tutorials and sample code for PyQt4.

An [[http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=33&sessionId=41&confId=44|overview of PyQt4]] was presented at EuroPython 2006.

An introduction to using [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/Creating_GUI_Applications_with_PyQt_and_Qt_Designer|PyQt4 with Qt Designer]] for the development of GUI applications was given at [[http://www.pyconuk.org|PyCon UK 2007]].

The book
[[http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html|Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt]] is PyQt4-specific and covers development with Python 2.5, PyQt4 and Qt 4.2/4.3.

Installation instructions for PyQt 4.4 on Windows with MinGW is available at [[http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/01/how-to-install-pyqt-41-python-25-and-qt_8340/]]

French translation of PyQt 4 Documentation is available at [[http://leroybrice.free.fr/?/Python-Bindings-Tools-For-QtV]]
