'''Let's build a cool app for Zope 3!'''

Last year, I participated in the Zope3 Development Sprint. While it was extremely valuable to me as a learning experience, I didn't feel I was contributing very much to the development of Zope3.

This year, I'd like to collaborate on building a new and cool application ''with'' Zope3. I don't intend this to be a Zope3 tutorial (though I expect most participants will learn a lot).

= Goals =
Saturday, March 19
 * Have fun hacking!

 * Meet and work with other Zope3 developers

 * Build a functional application that will showcase Zope3

 * Provide feedback on using Zope 3 to build apps

= Ideas for what app to build =

Write your suggestions here, and add your name to vote on the ones you like.

Ideally, the app should be one we can credibly complete in four days time, with a small but focused feature set and a reasonable amount of polish. 

 * A photo library/gallery ([http://svn.zope.org/photo/ photo/photoslides] already exists)

 * An Amazon storefront

 * Some kind of social-networking app (extending the 'buddy' example?)

 * A discussion board (the Zope 3 programmers guide already [http://svn.zope.org/messageboard/ implements one])

 * A weblog or other minimal CMS

 * Port or reimplement an existing Zope2 app

  * Squishdot

  * (add your suggestion here)

 * A Zope3 implementation of the [http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/jps131/docs/index.html Java Pet Store] demo

 * Build something based on MichelPelletier's Zemantic catalog

 * (add your suggestion here)


= Pre-requisites? =

Good question. I think some familiarity with Zope and Python would be a minimum, though we'll also have non-coding tasks. Having gone through the Zope3 tutorial would be ideal, and some familiarity with the [http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/Documentation rest of the material] available would be welcome.
