'''Let's build a cool app for Zope 3!'''

Last year, I participated in the Zope3 Development Sprint. While it was extremely valuable to me as a learning experience, I didn't feel I was contributing very much to the development of Zope3.

This year, I'd like to collaborate on building a new and cool application ''with'' Zope3. I don't intend this to be a Zope3 tutorial (though I expect most participants will learn a lot).

= Participants =

 If you aren't planning to be available for all four days of the sprint, please note which days you will be around next to your name.

 * MichaelBernstein
 
 * MichaelWeigend

 * AndyDustman

If you don't sign up, you can still come and participate. The sign up is to give us an idea who will be there.

= Goals =
Saturday, March 19
 * Have fun hacking!

 * Meet and work with other Zope3 developers

 * Build a functional application that will showcase Zope3

 * Provide feedback on using Zope 3 to build apps

= Ideas for what app to build =

Write your suggestions here, and add your name to vote on the ones you like.

Ideally, the app should be one we can credibly complete in four days time, with a small but focused feature set and a reasonable amount of polish. 

 * A photo library/gallery ([http://svn.zope.org/photo/ photo/photoslides] already exists)

 * An Amazon storefront

 * Some kind of social-networking app (extending the 'buddy' example?)

   * How about something along the lines of orkut meets Advogato meets del.icio.us
   meets Slashdot meets rawdog? There is a lot of overlapping functionality
   here; think of del.icio.us as the bizarro Slashdot, where everyone can post articles,
   duplicates are encouraged, and nobody can post comments. Major points:

     1. Membership management

      a. New members: How do members get added? Add themselves? Invited by other members? Invited/approved by administrators?
 
      b. Member relationships/ratings: Friend or foe? Guru or noob? Do you think I'm sexy? I like cats.

     2. Articles/links, and their keywords and comments.

      a. rating system for articles, perhaps as simple as how many members linked to it recently (think del.icio.us/popular)

      b. keyword filters/modifiers

     3. Diary/blog, or make this functionally the same as #2?

     4. Syndication (like del.icio.us)

     5. News reader/aggregator (like rawdog)

     6. Event calendar (or perhaps incorporate space-time metadata into #2)

     7. Make it scale.

 * A discussion board (the Zope 3 programmers guide already [http://svn.zope.org/messageboard/ implements one])

 * A weblog or other minimal CMS

 * Port or reimplement an existing Zope2 app

  * Squishdot

  * (add your suggestion here)

 * A Zope3 implementation of the [http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/jps131/docs/index.html Java Pet Store] demo

 * Build something based on MichelPelletier's Zemantic catalog

 * (add your suggestion here)


= Pre-requisites? =

Good question. I think some familiarity with Zope and Python would be a minimum, though we'll also have non-coding tasks. Having gone through the Zope3 tutorial would be ideal, and some familiarity with the [http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/Documentation rest of the material] available would be welcome.
