Last year, I participated in the Zope3 Development Sprint. While it was extremely valuable to me as a learning experience, I didn't feel I was contributing very much to the development of Zope3.

This year, I'd like to collaborate on building a new and cool application with Zope3. I *don't* intend this to be a Zope3 tutorial (though I expect most participants will learn a lot).

== Ideas for what app to build ==

 Write your suggestions here, and add your name to "vote" on the ones you like.

 * A photo library/gallery

 * An Amazon storefront

 * A social-networking app (extending the 'buddy' example?)

 * a weblog

 * ???

== Pre-requisites? ==

 Good question. I think having gone through the Zope3 tutorial should be sufficient as a minimum, though some familiarity with the [http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/Zope3Book/Documentation rest of the material] available would be welcome.
