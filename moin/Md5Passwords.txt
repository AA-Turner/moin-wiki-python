= MD5 Passwords =

It's ''very'' easy to create MD5 passwords with Python-

You just:

{{{
#!python
import md5

key_string = raw_input( "Key to turn into an MD5 password? " )

print md5.new( key_string ).hexdigest()
}}}

The "hexdigest" form is the form you frequently find used in databases and in online forums.
