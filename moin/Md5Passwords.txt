= MD5 Passwords =

It's ''very'' easy to create MD5 passwords with Python-

You just:

{{{
#!python
import md5

key_string = raw_input( "Key to turn into an MD5 password? " )

print md5.new( key_string ).hexdigest()
}}}

ex: "{{{robots}}}" turns into "{{{27f5e15b6af3223f1176293cd015771d}}}"

The "hexdigest" form is the form you frequently find used in databases and in online forums.

= Discussion =

A good idea is to include a 'salt' with the hash as well, which will prevent people using a dictionary with 
md5 hashes of common passwords. When you check a password, just add the salt to the front of the password and hash it.
The salt can be any random string.

Something like this:

{{{
#!python
import md5

key_string = "SecretPassword"
salt = "1Ha7"

hash = md5.new( salt + key_string ).hexdigest()
print "%s:%s" % (salt, hash) # Store these
}}}
