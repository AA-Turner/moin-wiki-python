"There's Only One Way To Do It"

This was the slogan PythonLabs came up with for the T-shirts given away by the defunct BeOpen at OSCON 2000.  It was meant as a tongue-in-cheek response to Larry Wall's Perl slogal "There's more than one way to do it." but the community liked it and it has often been taken very seriously in language or library design discussions.  The Zen of Python is more nuanced:
"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch."
