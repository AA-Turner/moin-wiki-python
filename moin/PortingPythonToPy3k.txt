**************************
Porting Python Code to 3.0
**************************


Rough outline of what needs to be covered
=========================================

* Using 2to3.  *(-> Benjamin)*
* Bringing code up to shape to work with 2.6 and 2to3->3.0.
* What about 2.3/2.4/2.5 compatibility?


Martin's notes from psycopg2
============================

- bytes vs. strings 1. Design decisions needs to be taken what exactly
  must be represented as bytes, and what as strings. In many cases, that
  was easy for psycopg, except for the question how SQL queries are
  represented. It appears clear that they are plain text, however, the
  Postgres API requires them to be transmitted in the connection
  encoding. I still decided to represent them internally in Unicode,
  but converting them to the connection encoding as early as possible
  probably would have worked as well.

- bytes vs. strings 2. To keep the implementation portable across 2.x
  and 3.x, I added a number of macros. Most useful was Text_FromUTF8,
  particularly when applied to the (many) string literals. It is
  defined as PyString_FromString for 2.x, and PyUnicode_FromString for
  3.x.

- RO is gone, you need to use READONLY (which also works in 2.x).

- PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT needs to be used for types. I define it for
  2.x if it isn't already defined.

- the buffer object is gone; I use memoryview in 3.x.

- various tests where in the code of the form
  if version_major ==  and version_minor > 4 (say, or 5)
  This will break for 3.x; you have to write
  if (version_major == 2 and version_minor > 4) or version_major > 2

- module initialization is different. I moved the majority of the
  code into a static function, which then gets conditionally called from
  either the 2.x or 3.x init routine.

- Python code 1: I used the 2to3 support in distutils

- Python code 2: setup.py needs to run in both versions. I had to
  replace popen2 with subprocess if available. Also, map() now
  returns an iterator, which I explicitly convert into list, and
  so on.

- Python code 3: the test suite doesn't get installed, and hence
  not auto-converted with 2to3 support. I explicitly added a 2to3
  conversion into the test runner, which copies the py3 version of
  the test into a separate directory.
