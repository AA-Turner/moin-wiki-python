Anybody interested in meeting other Django users? Please leave a note!

'''newsflash''': We'll try to gather together at the lunch on Tuesday. Meeting point is at 12:00 around the information desk (where it's probably not as crowded as around the food ....) Well ... this ain't gonna work if food is short ;-)   -- MichaelRadziej
