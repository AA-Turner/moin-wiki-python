'''Paul Leopardi''' with

I will be talking on how to combine the use of MPI4Py with SciPy sparse linear algebra, including how to lay out MPI groups and communicators, and how to use Gatherv effectively.

and

'''Kirill Kouzoubov''' with

Take advantage of modern parallel hardware with Open ComputingLanguage (OpenCL) framework. In this talk I'll give a brief overviewof OpenCL parallel computation model, and how it can be used fromwithin python, leveraging excellent PyOpenCL library, to acceleratenumeric heavy computations.
