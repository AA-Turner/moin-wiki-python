== The Canberra Python Users Group (2013) ==
'''We meet the first Thursday of every month at 7pm'''

Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)

The responsible parties are [[mailto:padarn.wilson AT anu.edu.au|Padarn Wilson]][[mailto:jay.larson AT anu.edu.au|Jay Larson]][[mailto:paul.leopardi AT anu.edu.au|Paul Leopardi]] and [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]]  along with a number of other Python folk. Feel free to contact any of us with questions

'''Where to get information:'''

There's a [[https://plus.google.com/communities/103339628935802168974|Canberra Python Users Group]] community page on Google+. Please join up and add yourself to the group! We'll keep you posted with announcements about the meetings. The Meetup group that was used in 2012 http://www.meetup.com/Canberra-Python-Meetup-Group/  still exists and has been updated with this planned meeting. RSVP via the meetup page would be greatly appreciated.

'''Venue:'''

Meetings are hosted by Computer Science at ANU and are held in room N101, CSIT building ANU.

Map: https://maps.google.com.au/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=2626780438576429652&q=CSIT+Building&iwloc=A&gl=AU&hl=en

This can be tricky to find the first time: it's a semi-circular glass-fronted meeting room directly south of the large bike cage which is located behind the CSIT building. If you can get to the back-side of the CSIT building and arrive between 6:45 and 7pm there should be some fellow pythoneers around this vicinity to help point you in the right direction.

'''Upcoming meetings:'''

The next meeting is scheduled for Thurdsay 2nd May 2013 at 6pm.

The topics for the meeting are: "Statistics using Python" and "Effective workflow using Python".

Calendar: [[https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=be798mth6kvue1cer4gsr0c848@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Australia/Sydney|HTML]], [[https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/be798mth6kvue1cer4gsr0c848@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics|iCal]]

'''Food:'''

We plan to organize pizza or similar to arrive during the meeting for those interested. We will also provide some (non alcoholic!) drinks. After the meeting, those who are interested may continue discussions at the Wig and Pen on Alinga Street.

=== Potential Topics ===
We are open to any topics Python related at this stage, though we will discuss the possibility of encouraging a theme of 'Scientific Computing and Analytics' at the first meeting.

Some topics that have interested the Canberra python users in the past are:

 * GIS, data analysis, SciPy/NumPy, wxPython, PyJS (Pyjamas), Django, Python hardware interfaces
 * Demos of what you're doing/working on!

=== Talks Schedule ===
'''Thursday April 4th 2013:'''

At the first meeting of the year we invite anyone to give a short talk about what they are doing with Python and what they are excited about.

'''Wednesday 7th March 2012'''

Summary: plenty of new faces despite the sleety, cold Canberra "Autumn" weather. Nice mixed bag of interests, more python games people which seemed to spark some interest.

Thanks to Adam for telling us about his deployment system.

We will definitely be following up on interest in being involved with Zookeepr project for [[http://lca2013.linux.org.au/|Linux Conf]].

Lots of great discussion for future talks, tutes and demos. There was a bit of interest in some fun python basics.

A group of hardened web-tech/django folk were talking queuing, caching and static serving until nearly 11pm at the Wig. Good times.

'''5 minute talks'''

 * "Package deployment and management in a locked down Windows environment" - Adam Kerz
  * [[CanberraPUG?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=pythonPackages.ppt|Presentation]]

 * "Upcoming: PyConAU; Linux Conf AU and Zookeepr interest" - Elena Williams
