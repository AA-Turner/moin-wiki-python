'''First Wednesday of every month'''

Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)

The main culprits are [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]] and [[mailto:ele.wil@gmail.com|Elena Williams]], along with a number of other Python folk.

There's a meetup.com group to track numbers etc. Please join up and add yourself to the group! We'll keep you posted with announcements about the meetings. http://www.meetup.com/Canberra-Python-Meetup-Group/.

Meetings are hosted by Computer Science at ANU and are held in room N101, CSIT building ANU. This can be tricky to find the first time: it's a semi-circular glass-fronted meeting room directly south of the large bike cage which is located behind the CSIT building. If you arrive between 6 and 6.30 there should be some fellow pythoneers around this vicinity to help point you in the right direction if you can get to the back-side of the CSIT building.

=== Potential Topics ===

If you're not sure on a topic, or don't want to give a presentation,
perhaps you could give us an idea of topics or areas that you would like
to hear about - that way we can encourage people who have that particular
area of expertise, but who might be wavering. Some topics that have been suggested are:

 * Django
 * PIL
 * pygame
 * pyopengl
 * zope
 * pypi
 * distutils
 * wxPython
 * Twisted
 * web/CGI
 * Databases
 * Unit Testing
 * Patterns
 * web2py

If you feel qualified to give a talk/presentation on any of these, let me know and I'll schedule you in for a timeslot. Or just edit the wiki directly - that's what it's all about, after all :)
