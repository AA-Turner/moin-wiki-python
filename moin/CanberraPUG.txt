== The Canberra Python Users Group (2013) ==
'''We meet the first Thursday of every month at 6pm'''

Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)

The responsible parties are [[mailto:padarn.wilson AT anu.edu.au|Padarn Wilson]][[mailto:jay.larson AT anu.edu.au|Jay Larson]][[mailto:paul.leopardi AT anu.edu.au|Paul Leopardi]] and [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]]  along with a number of other Python folk. Feel free to contact any of us with questions

'''Where to get information:'''

Information about meetings will be updated on this wiki as promptly as possible. Discussion about the upcoming meetings and reminders are posted to the mailing list.

You can also email one of the organizers if you wish.

'''Venue:'''

WE HAVE MOVED!

The new location is John Dedman G35 (the Neumann room). This location will hopefully stop us having to deal with the persistent technical issues in N101.

The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday 1st August 2013 at 6pm.

- '''Nariman Habili''' will be talking to us about work he has done  with Geoscience Australia using GIS and python - and potentially also  PyQt if time permits and there is interest
