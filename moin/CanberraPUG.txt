'''First Wednesday of every month'''

Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)

The main culprits are [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]] and [[mailto:ele.wil@gmail.com|Elena Williams]], along with a number of other Python folk.

There's a meetup.com group to track numbers etc. Please join up and add yourself to the group! We'll keep you posted with announcements about the meetings. http://www.meetup.com/Canberra-Python-Meetup-Group/.

Meetings are hosted by Computer Science at ANU and are held in room N101, CSIT building ANU.

This can be tricky to find the first time: it's a semi-circular glass-fronted meeting room directly south of the large bike cage which is located behind the CSIT building. If you can get to the back-side of the CSIT building and arrive between 6 and 6.30 there should be some fellow pythoneers around this vicinity to help point you in the right direction.

We meet on the first Wednesday of every month at 6pm start, with talks commencing at 6.30pm. 

After talks, discussions are informally encouraged to continue at the Wig and Pen on Alinga Street.
