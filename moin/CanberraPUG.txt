== The Canberra Python Users Group (2013) ==
'''We meet the first Thursday of every month at 6pm'''

Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)

The responsible parties are [[mailto:padarn.wilson AT anu.edu.au|Padarn Wilson]][[mailto:jay.larson AT anu.edu.au|Jay Larson]][[mailto:paul.leopardi AT anu.edu.au|Paul Leopardi]] and [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]]  along with a number of other Python folk. Feel free to contact any of us with questions

'''Where to get information:'''

Information about meetings will be updated on this wiki as promptly as possible. Discussion about the upcoming meetings and reminders are posted to the mailing list.

Join the mailing list here: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/canberra-pug

You can also email one of the organizers if you wish.

'''Venue:'''

Meetings are hosted by Computer Science at ANU and are held in room N101, CSIT building ANU.

This can be tricky to find the first time: it's a semi-circular glass-fronted meeting room directly south of the large bike cage which is located behind the CSIT building. If you can get to the back-side of the CSIT building and arrive between 5:45 and 6pm there should be some fellow pythoneers around this vicinity to help point you in the right direction.

'''Upcoming meetings:'''

The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday 4th July 2013 at 6pm.

- Paul Leopardi will talk about his experience at SciPy 2013.

- Padarn Wilson will give a short introduction to the iPython Notebook.

We will also discuss the upcoming PyConAU 2013 (Hobart) meeting. We have a few users going to PyConAU, which is the following week, so it might be a good opportunity to ask them to be on the lookout for anything of particular interest.

There is the possibility that some members of the group will go and have dinner after the meeting nearby.
