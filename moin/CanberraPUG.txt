'''Last Wednesday of every month'''


Newcomers are always welcome; we're a friendly bunch and female-friendly :)


The responsible parties are [[mailto:ed@pythoncharmers.com|Ed Schofield]] and [[mailto:ele.wil@gmail.com|Elena Williams]], along with a number of other Python folk.


There's a meetup.com group to track numbers etc. Please join up and add yourself to the group! We'll keep you posted with announcements about the meetings. http://www.meetup.com/Canberra-Python-Meetup-Group/.


Meetings are hosted by Computer Science at ANU and are held in room N101, CSIT building ANU.


Map: http://g.co/maps/7b2f5


This can be tricky to find the first time: it's a semi-circular glass-fronted meeting room directly south of the large bike cage which is located behind the CSIT building. If you can get to the back-side of the CSIT building and arrive between 6 and 6.30 there should be some fellow pythoneers around this vicinity to help point you in the right direction.


We meet on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm start, with talks commencing at 6.30pm.

After talks, discussions are informally encouraged to continue at the Wig and Pen on Alinga Street.

'''Wednesday 7th March 2012'''


Summary: plenty of new faces despite the sleety, cold Canberra "Autumn" weather. Nice mixed bag of interests, more python games people which seemed to spark some interest.


Thanks to Adam for telling us about his deployment system.


We will definitely be following up on interest in being involved with Zookeepr project for [[http://lca2013.linux.org.au/|Linux Conf]].


Lots of great discussion for future talks, tutes and demos. There was a bit of interest in some fun python basics.


A group of hardened web-tech/django folk were talking queuing, caching and static serving until nearly 11pm at the Wig. Good times.
