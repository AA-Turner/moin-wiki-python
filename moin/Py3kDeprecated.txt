Is this the right place or is there another page with all py3000 removals of deprecated and obsolete things? (Nestor) Maybe just the ones not mentioned in PEP3100 as done?

= String module =
  *atof -> float
  *atoi -> int
  *atol -> int
  *capitalize, expandtabs, find, rfind, rfind, index, rindex, count, lower, split, rsplit, splitfields, join, joinfields, lstrip, rstrip, strip, swapcase, translate, upper, ljust, rejust, center, zfill, replace -> methods

= builtins =
  *reduce -> functools.reduce
  *reload
intern? (is that used? can we move that to a module?)
buffer? (under construction, still builtin or its own module?)

= Platforms =
The following platforms will not be supported in 3.0. Their code (conditional compilation, platform-specific attributes and functions, documentation, etc) will be removed. Skip Montanaro is working on this (and will shout for help when he gets confused).
  * RISCOS
  * BeOS
  * Irix
  * Tru64
