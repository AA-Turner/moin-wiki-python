= Platforms =
The following platforms will not be supported in 3.0. Their code (conditional compilation, platform-specific attributes and functions, documentation, etc) will be removed. Skip Montanaro is working on this (and will shout for help when he gets confused).
  * RISCOS
  * BeOS
  * Irix
  * Tru64


Is this the right place or is there another page with all py3000 removals of deprecated and obsolete things? (Nestor) This is just by googling the docs.
