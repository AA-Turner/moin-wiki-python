== Topics ==

There are a number of areas that we can address at the sprint:

 * Installing large applications; see [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2005-February/004389.html Fred's post to the Distutils-SIG] for more on this topic.

 * Defining a way to define new ''classes'' of files that can be installed.  Zope 3 would like this for the "package-includes" files we use; it's likely generally useful.

 * Phillip Eby brought up the idea of application plugins; it would be really nice to see this happen.  He and Bob Ippolito have some [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs design notes] and Bob Ippolito has begun an implementation of the runtime.  In addition to plugins, this "Python Egg" format should be useful for distributing libraries and building applications (via py2exe/py2app) as well.

 * RichardJones wants to work on PEPs [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0314.html 314] and [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0243.html 243] (implement metadata spec 1.1 and a source package upload mechanism / repository).  FredDrake would be glad to work on PEP 314 support. Note that the online version of PEP 314 needs revision (AMK has the revised copy) - see the recent catalog-sig archives for detail. Also, there's revisions needed to PEP 243 which haven't been written yet (mostly to do with cleaning up the use of the HTTP spec). To support the PEP 243 effort, it would be good to have someone available who has root access to python.org to get that side of things running.
