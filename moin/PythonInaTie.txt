Python in a Tie is something business people like a lot, and all other users can use too. And that is a stable Python release that is maintained for a reasonable period of time (18 months), without any (major, incompatible) feature additions, but regular bugfix releases.

Originally, this referred to 2.2, which was supposed to meet that promise.  Now, the same no-new-features promise applies to any major python release, and they are all expected to be maintained for at least about 18 months from initial release.

''[We prolly need more info than this and some URLs to the Python Business Forum, feel free to add those.]''

The PythonBusinessForum used to be found at http://www.python-in-business.org but the domain name has been taken over by a spam site.
