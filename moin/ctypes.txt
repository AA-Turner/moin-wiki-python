=== CTypes FAQs ===

'''FAQ: How do I copy bytes to Python from a ctypes.Structure?'''

{{{
def send(self):
	return buffer(self)[:]
}}}

'''FAQ: How do I copy bytes to a ctypes.Structure from Python?'''

{{{
def receiveSome(self, bytes):
	fit = min(len(bytes), ctypes.sizeof(self))
	ctypes.memmove(ctypes.addressof(self), bytes, fit)
}}}

'''FAQ: Why should I fear using ctypes.memmove?'''

ctypes.memmove emulates the memmove of C with complete faithfulness. If you tell memmove to copy more bytes than sizeof(self), you will overwrite memory that you do not own, with indeterminate consequences, arbitrarily delayed.

'''FAQ: How do I change the byte length of a ctypes.Structure?'''

Declare the max length and allocate that much memory, but then copy less than all of the memory allocated. You change the byte length that you use, not the byte length that ctypes.sizeof reports. For example:

{{{
class MaxByteString(ctypes.Structure):
	_fields_ = [('bytes', 0xFF * ctypes.c_ubyte)]
}}}

'''FAQ: How do I say memcpy?'''

{{{
ctypes.memmove
}}}

'''FAQ: How do I say offsetof?'''

{{{
def offsetof(self, field):
	return ctypes.addressof(field) - ctypes.addressof(self)
}}}

That example of an offsetof method works when self is an instance of the structure, the field is a member of self, and the field is an instance of an array class or structure class.

The offsetof macro of C works more often. The C macro works for any type of field and works when you have the class but no instance. Imitating the C macro with Python ctypes is possible but tedious: you begin by fetching the {{{_pack_}}} of the {{{self.__class__}}} and the {{{ctypes.sizeof}}} for each of the {{{_fields_}}}.

'''FAQ: How do I say uchar?'''

{{{
ctypes.c_ubyte
}}}

'''FAQ: How do I say ((void *) -1)?'''

{{{
INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE = ctypes.c_void_p(-1).value
}}}

2. Post newbie CTypes questions into comp.lang.python, per the remarkable invitation of:

''from: http://wiki.python.org/moin/MovingToPythonFromOtherLanguages''

''Don't be surprised to have your questions answered by the original ...
The best thing about comp.lang.python is how "newbie-friendly" the mail group is.
You can ask any question and never get a "RTFM" thrown back at you.''
