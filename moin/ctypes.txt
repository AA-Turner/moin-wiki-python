=== CTypes FAQs ===

'''FAQ: How do I copy bytes to Python from a ctypes.Structure?'''

def send(self):
	return buffer(self)[:]

'''FAQ: How do I copy bytes to a ctypes.Structure from Python?'''

def receiveSome(self, bytes):
	ctypes.memmove(ctypes.addressof(self), bytes, ctypes.sizeof(self))

'''FAQ: Why should I fear using ctypes.memmove?'''

ctypes.memmove emulates the memmove of C with complete faithfulness. If you tell memmove to copy more bytes than sizeof(self), you will overwrite memory that you do not own, with indeterminate consequences, arbitrarily delayed.
