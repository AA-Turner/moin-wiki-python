## page was renamed from How to use Python with MySQL
This is all for MS Windows.

Prereq: - Python (2.4.2 in my case) - Install MySQL (5 in my case)  - Check that it works fine

Next steps I then install MySQLdb (version 1.2)

When running the installer on Win XP I get - message that Python v2.3 could not be found in registry.

I've tried this on a few PC -- all the same.

Any ideas? no
