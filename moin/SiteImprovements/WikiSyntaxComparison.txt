The rationale for the change is that links, apart from those in the `WikiName` and bare URL styles, end up with a uniform syntax, and the embedding of an object in the page is done by modifying the bracketing style. Previously, linking to a page in the same Wiki and using a label instead of the page name involved a relatively arcane syntax; this common case now fits in much better.

The drawback of 1.6 syntax is that you need to type more and press Shift key more than necessary. Links become less readable, because of excessive decoration and lack of whitespace between logical parts. Another big problem with this syntax is that there is no pipe symbol on Russian keyboard layout, and even if don't need to switch layouts to copy/paste a link - you definitely need to switch it twice for the pipe to comment it. -- [[techtonik]] <<DateTime(2010-09-30T13:09:49Z)>>

 Well, it's a shame about the pipe character, but the other arguments about why Moin syntax "sucks" aren't convincing: you can't apparently have non-!WikiName links in Google Code or Trac (unless "no need" means that Trac figures it out), Trac still uses the baroque `wiki:WikiName` stuff when making a labelled link. And the full URL for attachments? It's exactly this kind of stuff which either confuses the Wiki when trying to label links (a problem I've seen with !MediaWiki) or just breaks when any aspect of the Wiki configuration changes (a problem that also comes with !MediaWiki). You should definitely argue with the Moin folks about that pipe character, though. -- PaulBoddie <<DateTime(2010-09-30T15:24:39+0100)>>
