= pyFLTK: Multi Platform GUI Toolkit =

pyFLTK is a Python wrapper for the [[FLTK]] GUI toolkit. It utilizes SWIG and wraps the current stable version of FLTK.

== Install tips ==

These notes assume you're using Ubuntu GNU/Linux, your system Python (the one installed in `/usr/bin`), and your system OpenGL libraries. And that you'll be ''manually'' installing FLTK and pyFLTK.

=== OpenGL ===

Before installing FLTK, be sure you have OpenGL and its development libraries installed on your system. On Ubuntu 8.10, using a DRI-compatible card, some of these packages are:

{{{
libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
}}}

`aptitude install` any that you don't already have installed.


=== FLTK ===

The current stable release as of Jan 2009 is 1.1.9. Building and installing (into `/usr/local`) should be a simple matter of running `make` and then `sudo make install`. See its README for more details.

You want to build and install your own because the stock FLTK that's available with Ubuntu 8.10 is not configured to use OpenGL.


=== pyFLTK ===

First make sure you have the Python header files installed (`aptitude install python-dev`). After that, see the instructions in the pyFLTK distribution for instructions, which are basically:

{{{
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

That installs the relevant python files into into `/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages`. After installation, you should run the included demos to make sure everything is working right (instructions are in the INSTALL file).
