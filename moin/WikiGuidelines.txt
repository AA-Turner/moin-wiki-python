= Wiki Editing Guidelines =

Currently there are only few guidelines for creating a page inside Python Wiki:

 * If you want to add a new page, check to see if there isn't already a page for that topic.
 * Do not use contrived WikiName page names. Where the name of something (for example, JEdit) is not already a WikiName, do not add spurious capital letters or change the case of letters (for example, JEdIt) to make such a name. Instead just create a page and then use the [[HelpOnLinking|link syntax]] (for example, `[[JEdit]]`) to refer to the page.
 * If you can't edit a page because you don't have permission, yet really need to change something, send a mail to <<MailTo(pydotorg-www AT python DOT org)>> mentioning the page and your motivations. We have locked down some pages of this Wiki which have proven to be continuing targets of vandals.
 * If you want to create your own "homepage" on the Wiki, please only do so if you're providing or promoting Python-related content or if you have signed your name on another page (and want others to be able to contact you). Please add your homepage to CategoryHomepage.
 * Please structure long pages to sections (learn to use `== headings ==`).
 * If you have source code included, run it yourself to test for at least simple errors.
 * Avoid duplicating information when not necessary, and respect copyrights. If you are unsure, at least credit the source, so that others can fix things if needed.
 * Learn to use Wiki format mentioned in HelpOnFormatting. It allows for more consistent page styles.
 * You can use [[HelpOnParsers/ReStructuredText|ReStructured Text]] mark-up, but this can be confusing to people, so try not to do this too much. Importing content from somewhere else for initial publication is probably the most excusable exception. Some features like category membership do not work for ReST pages, so consider converting ReST content to Wiki format at some point.
 * Take advantage of this Wiki's ability to format and colour Python source code - it is easier to read than a simple, plain monochrome section. An example:
 {{{#!python
from hello import world

def say_hello():
    """Just say hello :)"""
    what = world()
    message = what.greet()  # no, there's no module named "hello" 
                            # in Python stdlib - at least not yet :)
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hello()
}}}
 Use `numbers=disable` after the language declaration (such as `#!python`) to remove line numbering.
 * When there's no content on a topic, it's better to put ''something'' in and let others correct it, don't you think? What are you waiting for?!

== Etiquette ==

When editing existing pages, the following guidelines are proposed:

 * By all means make edits to pages in order to fix mistakes, update and add information, and so on.
 * Consider creating an account so that your contributions are acknowledged.
 * Use the preview button before committing.
 * When editing pages, particularly larger ones, try and commit all changes at once, or at least as many as possible at the same time. Don't make lots of small changes, saving each one: this fills the page history with micro-edits which make it very difficult to see earlier history information.
 * Remember that some pages have been around for a long time, are actively maintained, and are the result of collaboration between a number of people. It is therefore quite impolite to go in and to spontaneously reorganise such pages or to decide that your own editorial preferences overrule those of the people who have worked hard to produce the information you want to change, remove or rearrange. Consider contacting one or more of the maintainers before seeking to "refactor" content.
 * Respect any editorial guidelines on the pages you wish to edit. ''Do not remove guidelines you do not agree with!''
