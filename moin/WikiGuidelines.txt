= Wiki Editing Guidelines =

Currently there are only few guidelines for creating a page inside Python Wiki:

 * If you want to add a new page, check to see if there isn't already a page for that topic.
 * If you can't edit a page because you don't have permission, yet really need to change something, send a mail to <<MailTo(pydotorg AT python DOT org)>> mentioning the page and your motivations. We have locked down some parts of this Wiki to prevent vandalism.
 * Please structure long pages to sections (learn to use '== headings ==').
 * If you have source code included, run it yourself to test for at least simple errors.
 * Avoid duplicating information when not necessary, and respect copyrights. If you are unsure, at least credit the source, so that others can fix things if needed.
 * Learn to use Wiki format mentioned in HelpOnFormatting. It allows for more consistent page styles.
 * You can use [[HelpOnParsers/ReStructuredText|ReStructured Text]] mark-up, but this can be confusing to people, so try not to do this too much. Importing content from somewhere else for initial publication is probably the most excusable exception.
 * Take advantage of this Wiki's ability to format and colour Python source code - it is easier to read than a simple, plain monochrome section. An example:
 {{{
#!python
from hello import world

def say_hello():
    """Just say hello :)"""
    what = world()
    message = what.greet()  # no, there's no module named "hello" 
                            # in Python stdlib - at least not yet :)
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hello()
}}}
 * When there's no content on a topic, it's better to put ''something'' in and let others correct it, don't you think? What are you waiting for?!
