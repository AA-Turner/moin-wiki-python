(when there's no content, it's better to put ''something'' in and let others correct it, no?)

Currently there are only few guidelines for creating a page inside Python Wiki:

 * Please structure long pages to sections (learn to use '== headings ==')
 * If you have source code included, run it yourself to test for at least simple errors
 * Avoid duplicating information when not necessary, and respect copyrights. If you are unsure, at least credit the source, so that others can fix things if needed
 * Learn to use wiki format => HelpOnFormatting. It allows for more consistent page styles
 * Take advantage of this wiki's ability to markup Python language - it is easier to read
   than simple, plain monotype font. An example:

{{{
#!python
from hello import world

def say_hello():
    """Just say hello :)"""
    what = world()
    message = what.greet()  # no, there's no module named "hello" 
                            # in Python stdlib - at least not yet :)
    return message

### main
say_hello()
}}}
Yeah, this is a stub only...
