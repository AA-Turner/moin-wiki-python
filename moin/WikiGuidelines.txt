(when there's no content, it's better to put ''something'' in and let others correct it, no?)

Currently there are only few guidelines for creating a page inside Python Wiki:

 * Please structure long pages to sections (learn to use '== headings ==')
 * If you have source code included, run it yourself to test for at least simple errors
 * Avoid duplicating information when not necessary, and respect copyrights. If you are unsure, 
   at least credit the source, so that others can fix things if needed
 * Learn to use WikiFormat => HelpOnFormatting. It allows for more consistent page styles

Yeah, this is a stub only...
