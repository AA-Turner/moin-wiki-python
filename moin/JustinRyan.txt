Also know as "bitmonk", or "justizin", I am an avid Python / Zope / Plone developer with deep Free Software roots, and a volunteer / contractor for the Association for Computing Machinery and some Chapters and Special Interest Groups, such as SIGGRAPH and SIGCHI.

I was involved in one of the five pythonology stories chosen by O'Reilly to be in a pamphlet promoting Python at the first annual OSCON:
