= Python and Parrot =

I am surprised we don't have a page on Parrot yet.

Here's notes from an email; I'm not taking the time to make it nice yet. If someone (hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me) wouldn't mind reworking this page and telling us about what's going on, it'd be greatfully appreciated..! (Sort of embarassing having the contents of a personal email on display here...)

No one is actively working on Python on top of Parrot at this point in
time, certainly not Guido.  I took [http://www.amk.ca/conceit/parrot.html a crude stab at a compiler]; Michal Wallace
wrote [http://pirate.tangentcode.com/ Pirate], which handles more of
Python.  The primary Parrot developer has issued
[http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000219.html a challenge] that
Parrot will run a Python benchmark faster than CPython by July 2004.

Note that the claims of Parrot being much faster are
proof-by-assertion at this point; no one has implemented full Perl or
Python on Parrot and timed it against the original implementation.
At last report, Pirate runs around 8 or 9 times slower than CPython.
