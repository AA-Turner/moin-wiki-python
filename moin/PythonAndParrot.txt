= Python and Parrot =

Parrot is an effort to write the equivalent of  .Net's Common Language Runtime or the Java Virtual Machine for dynamically-typed scripting languages.  The project is developed by the community working on Perl 6.

See http://www.parrotcode.org and 
[http://www.vendian.org/parrot/wiki/ the Parrot wiki.]

The Parrot source tree includes some support for Python, 
but it can't run very significant Python programs yet 
and no one seems to be actively working on it.
