= Python and Parrot =

I am surprised we don't have a page on Parrot yet.

Here's notes from an email; I'm not taking the time to make it nice yet. If someone (hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me) wouldn't mind reworking this page and telling us about what's going on, it'd be greatfully appreciated..! (Sort of embarassing having the contents of a personal email on display here...)
