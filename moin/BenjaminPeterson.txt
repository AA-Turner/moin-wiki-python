I'm a core Python developer. I do a little of everything, but specifically I'm the maintainer of [[2to3]], author of [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six|six]] Python 2.x/3.x compatibility library and the release manager of Python 2.7/3.1. I blog about mostly Python at http://pybites.blogspot.com.

My contact email is benjamin at python.org.
