== Why ? ==


[[WebTest|WebTest]] has recently join the Pylons project. Pylons' leaders complains about the poor test coverage of this package. So I (Gael Pasgrimaud) as the maintainer decided to help on that by organising a sprint hosted by my Company.

== Where ? ==


At Bearstech War Room !


Bearstech is a small company which provide some high quality hosting. We are based 40 passage des panoramas - 75002 Paris. Near to some finest places/bars and restaurants.


Our office is too small to host a sprint but fortunatly we have the "War Room". It can host at least 15/20 pythonistas.

The main goal is to increase tests coverage to 100% ! But you can also work on other non related tasks if you want. That's why a sprint is for!! Please add your subject bellow:
