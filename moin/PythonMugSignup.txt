= BayPiggies Python Mug Order List =

Here is where [http://baypiggies.net/] members can sign up for a python mug. 

Please list your name, eddress, and how many mugs you want. 

I'll collect money at the March 8 meeting (or you can pay via paypal to annaraven@gmail.com), and I will (hopefully) bring mugs to the April meeting. Thanks, AnnaRavenscroft
