My name is ""Beshr Kayali"", I knew python a long time ago, but I haven't started creating projects with it until recently.

Till now I have two projects with Python + PyGTK

http://backupod.sourceforge.net : Create Single-File backups for your iPod music library.
http://codic.sourceforge.net    : fast, cross-platform, off-line dictionary.
