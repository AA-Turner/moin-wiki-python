== Downloading Python ==

Before you start, you need Python on your computer, and you'll
probably need to download it.  If you're learning Python for the first
time, you should download the most recent stable version.  This is the
one with the highest number that isn't marked as an alpha or beta
release.  Currently the stable version is [http://www.python.org/2.4.2/ Python 2.4.2].

If you're running Windows:
here's a page with the most stable Windows download:
[http://www.python.org/2.4.2/ Python 2.4 for Windows].

If you are using a Mac, see the
[http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html MacPython page].
MacOS 10.2 (Jaguar) and 10.3 (Panther) come with Python already installed.

If you're using Linux, Python is probably packaged for your distribution.

  * In Ubuntu and Mandrake, python is already installed
  * For Red Hat, install the python2 and python2-devel packages.
  * For Debian, install the python2.4 and python2.4-dev packages.
