== Downloading Python ==


Before you start, you need Python on your computer, but you may not need to download it.
First of all check (by entering '''python''' in a command line window) that you don't
already have Python installed!  If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will
include a version number in its inital display. Generally any recent version will do,
as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.

If you need to install, you may as well download the most recent stable version.
This is the one with the highest number that isn't marked as an alpha or beta
release.  Currently the stable version is [http://www.python.org/2.4.3/ Python 2.4.3].

'''If you're running Windows''':
the most stable Windows download is
[http://www.python.org/2.4.3/ Python 2.4 for Windows].

'''If you're running Windows XP''':
a complete idiot's guide to installing ActivePython is at

'''If you are using a Mac''', see [http://www.python.org/download/mac/ this page].
MacOS 10.2 (Jaguar), 10.3 (Panther) and 10.4 (Tiger) come with Python already, but you will probably want to install the [http://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html latest universal build].

'''For Red Hat''', install the python2 and python2-devel packages.

'''For Debian''', install the python2.4 and python2.4-dev packages.

'''For other systems''', or '''if you want to install from source''', see the
[http://www.python.org/download/ general download page].
