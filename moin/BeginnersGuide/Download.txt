== Downloading Python ==


Before you start, you will need Python on your computer, but you may not need to download it.


First of all check that you don't already have Python installed by entering '''python''' in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. Generally any recent version will do, as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.


If you need to install Python, you may as well download the most recent stable version. This is the one with the highest number that isn't marked as an alpha or beta release. Please see the [[http://www.python.org/downloads/|Python downloads]] page for the most up to date versions of Python 2 and Python 3. They are available via the yellow download buttons on that page.


For advice on choosing between Python 2 and Python 3 see [[Python2orPython3|Python 2 or 3]].


'''If you're running Windows''': the most stable Windows downloads are available from the [[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/|Python for Windows]] page.
