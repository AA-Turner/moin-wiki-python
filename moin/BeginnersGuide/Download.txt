== Downloading Python ==


Before you start, you will need Python on your computer, but you may not need to download it.


First of all check that you don't already have Python installed by entering '''python''' in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. Generally any recent version will do, as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.


If you need to install Python, you may as well download the most recent stable version. This is the one with the highest number that isn't marked as an alpha or beta release. Currently the stable version of Python 2 is [[http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/|Python 2.7.3]]. The current stable version of Python 3 is [[http://python.org/download/releases/3.2.3/|Python 3.2.3]].


For advice on choosing between Python 2 and Python 3 see [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3|Python 2 or 3]].


'''If you're running Windows''': the most stable Windows download (Python 2) is [[http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi|Python 2.7.3 for Windows]]. For Python 3 it is [[http://python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/python-3.2.3.msi|Python 3.2.3 for Windows]].


'''If you're running Windows XP''': a complete guide to installing [[ActivePython|ActivePython]] is at [[http://www.richarddooling.com/index.php/2006/03/14/python-on-xp-7-minutes-to-hello-world/|Python on XP: 7 Minutes To "Hello World!"]]. [[ShowMeDo|ShowMeDo]] has [[http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=pythonOzsvaldPyNewbieSeries|two videos]] for downloading, installing and getting started with Python on a Windows XP machine - this series talks you through the Python, [[ActivePython|ActivePython]] and [[SciPy|SciPy]] distributions.
