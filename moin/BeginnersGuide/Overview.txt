Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language,
comparable to Perl, Tcl, Scheme, or Java.

Some of Python's notable features:

     * Python uses an elegant syntax for readable programs.
     * Python is an agile language that makes it easy to get your
     program working. This makes Python an ideal language for prototype
     development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without
     compromising maintainability.
     * A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers),
     strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, dictionaries.
     * Python supports object-oriented programming with classes
     and multiple inheritance.
     * Code can be grouped into modules and packages.
     * The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting
     in cleaner error handling.
     * Data types are strongly but dynamically typed. Mixing
     incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number)
     causes an exception to be raised.
     * Python contains advanced programming features such as generators
     and list comprehensions.
     * Automatic garbage collection frees you from the hassles of memory
     management.
     * The large standard library supports many common programming tasks
     such as connecting to web servers, regular expressions, and file
     handling.
     * Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of
     code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.
     * The Python interpreter is easily extended by adding new modules
     implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.
     * The interpreter can also be embedded into an application to
     provide a programmable interface.
     * Python runs on many different computers and operating systems:
     Windows, MacOS, many brands of Unix, OS/2, ...
     * Python is copyrighted but placed under [http://www.python.org/psf/license.html an open source license],
     meaning that Python can be freely distributed

== Questions and answers ==
Does this Program support Hacking. I have it installed when I did not install it
  A: Most likely some other program that depended on Python installed it legitimately.  Security holes would not be intentionally allowed in Python, and indeed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software open-source software] is verifiably more secure than non-open-source.   Your safest course of action if you're concerned about Python security is to closely monitor [http://www.python.org/security/].   

  But none of this explains how Python would make its way onto your system unbeknownst to you.   Since Python isn't intentionally trying to install itself like a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm worm] would (and any attempts to hack the code to make Python into a worm would be easily caught by hundreds of pairs of eyeballs), someone must have put it there.   Check the installation packages and documentation of any major software you might have installed recently.   HTH, ["Philip"]
