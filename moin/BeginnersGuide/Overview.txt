Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language,
comparable to Perl, Tcl, Scheme, or Java.

Some of Python's notable features:

     * Python uses an elegant syntax for readable programs.
     * Python is an agile language that makes it easy to get your
     program working. This makes Python an ideal language for prototype
     development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without
     compromising maintainability.
     * A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers),
     strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, dictionaries.
     * Python supports object-oriented programming with classes
     and multiple inheritance.
     * Code can be grouped into modules and packages.
     * The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting
     in cleaner error handling.
     * Data types are strongly but dynamically typed. Mixing
     incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number)
     causes an exception to be raised.
     * Python contains advanced programming features such as generators
     and list comprehensions.
     * Automatic garbage collection frees you from the hassles of memory
     management.
     * The large standard library supports many common programming tasks
     such as connecting to web servers, regular expressions, and file
     handling.
     * Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of
     code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.
     * The Python interpreter is easily extended by adding new modules
     implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.
     * The interpreter can also be embedded into an application to
     provide a programmable interface.
     * Python runs on many different computers and operating systems:
     Windows, MacOS, many brands of Unix, OS/2, ...
     * Python is copyrighted but placed under [http://www.python.org/psf/license.html an open source license]
     , meaning that Python can be freely distributed
