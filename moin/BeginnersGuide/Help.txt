== Getting Help ==

If you experience problems using Python, your first step should
be to check the documentation.

  *  The [[http://www.python.org/doc/current|Python documentation]]
  describes the language and the standard modules in detail.
  *  Many common questions are answered in  [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/|the Frequently Asked Question lists]].
  *  If you suspect you've discovered a bug in the Python core,
  search the [[http://bugs.python.org/|Python Bug Tracker]] to
  find out if it's already been reported.

If the documentation doesn't help, here's how to get help from real
people:

    * [[news:comp.lang.python|comp.lang.python]]
    Post to the Python newsgroup, renowned for its friendly
    and helpful atmosphere.  See [[http://www.python.org/community/lists/#comp-lang-python|the guide to Python mailing lists]] for more information.

    * [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor|tutor mailing list]]
    A moderate-volume mailing list for folks who want to ask questions
    while learning computer programming with Python.
    See [[http://www.python.org/community/lists/#tutor|the guide to Python mailing lists]] for
    more information.

    * [[mailto:help@python.org|help@python.org]]
    The Python help desk.  You can ask a group of knowledgeable
    volunteers questions about all your Python problems.  See
    [[http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help|the guide to Python mailing lists]] for
    more information.
