== Getting Help ==

If you experience problems using Python, your first step should
be to check the documentation.

  *  The [http://www.python.org/doc/current Python documentation]
  describes the language and the standard modules in detail.
  *  Many common questions are answered in  [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/ the Frequently Asked Question lists].
  *  If you suspect you've discovered a bug in the Python core,
  search the [http://bugs.python.org/ Python Bug Tracker] to
  find out if it's already been reported.
  *  For Python CGI questions, try Dave Mitchell's [http://starship.python.net/crew/davem/cgifaq/faqw.cgi Python CGI FAQ].

If the documentation doesn't help, here's how to get help from real
people:
