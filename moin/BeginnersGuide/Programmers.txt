This is a Wiki page. Users with edit rights can edit it. You are therefore free to (in fact, encouraged to) add details of material that other Python users will find useful. It is '''not''' an advertising page and is here to serve the whole Python community. Users who continually edit pages to give their own materials (particularly commercial materials) prominence, or spam the listing with multiple entries which point to resources with only slightly altered material, may subsequently find their editing rights disabled. ''You have been warned''. On a cheerier note - there is a constant stream of new and updated information on Python as the language is exploding in popularity.  Only enthusiastic volunteers can keep this page current, so if something helped you, feel free to link it here.
