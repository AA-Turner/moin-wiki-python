Dead Links / Broken Sites

If these sites come back to life, feel free to move them back up. Perhaps after 6 months, it would be reasonable to delete them.

 * Free Python video lectures are also available as a course titled [[Intro to programming with Python and Tkinter]], Unix users can view the video using mplayer once you have downloaded the files.

(One user reports success viewing the videos on OS X 10.4 using the VLC player -- http://www.videolan.org/) -- ''1/3/14: This is not a dead link but it is a dead option.
