== Python Examples and Sample Code ==

When you're learning, small examples can be very helpful.

 *  [[http://www.effbot.org/zone/librarybook-index.htm|The Python Standard Library]], an electronically published book by Fredrik Lundh,  examines most of the modules in Python's standard library,  describing what the module does and giving a short example of  its use.  Note that this book is now relatively old and so misses a lot of the developments of the last two decades.

 * The [[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/|Python Cookbook]], from ActiveState, is a very large collection of code snippets, some elementary and some advanced.
