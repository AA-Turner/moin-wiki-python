A page description language developed and marketed by Adobe Systems. PostScript can be used by a wide variety of computers and printers, and is the dominant format used for desktop publishing. Documents in PostScript format are able to use the full resolution of any PostScript printer, because they describe the page to be printed in terms of primitive shapes which are interpreted by the printer's own controller.
