Hi there! This is my personal Wiki page apparently.

If you want to tell me something, it's best to mail me at irmen (at) razorvine.net :)

Surf on to [http://irmen.razorvine.net my homepage].
Or have a look at my main Python project, ["Pyro"] B)

If my server is up, you could also have a sneek peek at my [http://www.razorvine.net/python/PythonForJavaProgrammers Python For Java Programmers Wiki]  (!)
I'm writing that small but hopefully fairly complete wiki mainly for a few of my coworkers
who know Java but no Python. I want to make them familiar with Python and I think it works
best by showing how Python compares to Java. Let me know what you think of it!
