Many languages have a SwitchStatement Aka CaseStatement.  Generally, these languages don't have convenient mapping abstractions built in, so a CaseStatement provides a slightly improved abstraction over ifs and gotos for mapping between an index and some corresponding code.

Python fortunately has mapping constructs built in, and has not need for a SwitchStatement:  Simply use a dictionary to look up the code that corresponds to the case you want to handle for a given index value, and execute it.
