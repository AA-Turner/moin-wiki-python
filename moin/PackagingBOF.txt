Enthought is currently using eggs and several extensions to eggs in order to package and ship the Enthought Python Distribution.  In doing this, we have encountered multiple opportunities for improving the current approach to packaging and distribution using eggs that we would like to discuss with anyone else in the Python community interested in these issues. 

Some of our ideas are well-developed and others are more ephemeral.  We would like to spend an hour or two discussing these ideas and comparing notes with anyone else interested in packaging and distributing python modules.
