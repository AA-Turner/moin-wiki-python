Mark Moraes has been using Python since 2000, it has replaced Tcl as my favorite scripting language and even edges out C as my favorite programming language.  So I'm presently trying to convert everyone I know to programming in Python.  I need to put some of my Python code up on my [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~moraes web site] or here.

Python things I've hacked on include
 * [http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html The Python Cryptography Toolkit], to which I contributed the Windows random number interface, a hashcash implementation and several enhancements to the Unix random number generator.

 * [http://project5.freezope.org/pears Pears], a simple and clean 3-pane RSS aggregator, written in Python with wxPython, to which I contributed much Unicode-related stuff so it works with feeds in many languages, and a high-performance high-volume storage subsystem.
