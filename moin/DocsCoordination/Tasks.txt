= Tasks =
for the documentation team

== Coding tasks ==
for those who want to develop the toolset

'''Get into the code'''

  The first task for those who want to develop the toolset is to make themselves familiar with it.  There are two documents, called `doctools/README` and `doctools/HACKING`, which give a short introduction how to use the command line tools and how the code is laid out.  ''Feel free to amend!''

'''Improvement suggestions'''

  I'd like to ask all of you to look at the new built documentation and collect thoughts about it -- not the content, but mainly the infrastructure such as navigational elements, accessibility etc.

  Note that the web application does use JavaScript in some places, but only for better usability (hopefully).  Users without JavaScript may not lose any functionality.  (This should be confirmed every now and then.)

=== The TODO file ===

The `doctools/TODO` file lists some things that should be done.
At the moment, these are:


== Conversion ==

When we find the toolset reasonably complete, we'll convert both the Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 SVN documentation branches to the new system.  The conversion itself is (should be, you'll see yourself) painless, but it can't do everything right.  For example, as the toplevel documents were completely separate until now, you couldn't directly link from, e.g. the library reference to a specific section of the language reference. These links will have to be corrected.

All these tasks to do after conversion are listed in the ``doctools/converter/newfiles/TODO`` file, which is copied to the reST source tree on conversion.

All other tasks that are independent of the converter are collected in ``doctools/TODO``.


== Content tasks ==

Of course, before the conversion changes to existing documents have to be made in LaTeX to the original sources.  However, you can already start extending and editing the "new" sources in `converter/newfiles` which don't have a LaTeX counterpart.

'''SF bugs'''

  There are lots of SF bugs and feature requests, and even the occasional patch with category "Documentation".  However, most of these are pretty big tasks though, such as (mostly obscure or advanced) features that are not documented, or documented not in the official docs, but some essay (new-style classes!).

  The bug tracker is at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470, the RFE and patches trackers can be reached through the "Tracker" menu at the page top.
