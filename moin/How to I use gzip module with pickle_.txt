== How to use the gzip module with the pickle module ==
I have a python program which creates a list of prime numbers [2L,3L,5L,7L,13L]. This program save the list to a file on the hard disk.

=== example of my code ===
{{{
  fp=open('primes.data','r')
  # ListOfPrimes=[2L,3L,5L,7L]
  ListOfPrimes=cPickle.load(fp)
  fp.close()

  generate_more_primes()

  fp=open('primes.data','w')
  cPickle.dump(ListOfPrimes,fp)
  fp.close()
}}}
=== What I want ===
My problem is that the primes.data file is now 9 megabytes in size
and I wanted to reduce the size taken by the file by first compressing
the data with the gzip module before saving it. Hence I would also need 
to decompress the data after I read it from the file.

Any idea how I can do this?
