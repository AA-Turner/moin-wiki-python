== How to use the gzip module with the pickle module ==
I have a python program which creates a list of prime numbers [2L,3L,5L,7L,13L]. This program save the list to a file on the hard disk.

=== example of my code ===
{{{
  fp=open('primes.data','r')
  # ListOfPrimes=[2L,3L,5L,7L]
  ListOfPrimes=cPickle.load(fp)
  fp.close()

  generate_more_primes()

  fp=open('primes.data','w')
  cPickle.dump(ListOfPrimes,fp)
  fp.close()
}}}
=== What I want ===
My problem is that the primes.data file is now 9 megabytes in size
and I wanted to reduce the size taken by the file by first compressing
the data with the gzip module before saving it. Hence I would also need
to decompress the data after I read it from the file.

Any idea how I can do this?

["lwickjr"]: I'd have to research for details, but you`d have to pickle the data to a string, then save the string to a file through gzip, and read the file from gzip into a string which is then unpickled.

MarcChr: There is no need for an temporary string. Just `import gzip` and use `gzip.open` instead of `open`:
{{{
import gzip, cPickle

fp=gzip.open('primes.data','rb') # This assumes that primes.data is already packed with gzip
ListOfPrimes=cPickle.load(fp)
fp.close()

generate_more_primes()

fp=gzip.open('primes.data','wb')
cPickle.dump(ListOfPrimes,fp)
fp.close()
}}}

You could also use the binary pickle format which is more compact: `cPickle.dump(ListOfPrimes,fp,1)`.
