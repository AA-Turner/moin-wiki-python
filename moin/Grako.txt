[[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grako|Grako]] (for grammar compiler) is a tool that takes grammars in a variation of EBNF as input, and outputs memoizing (Packrat) [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar|PEG]] parsers in Python.

Grako is different from other PEG parser generators in that the generated parsers use Python's very efficient exception-handling system to backtrack. Grako generated parsers simply assert what must be parsed; there are no complicated if-then-else sequences for decision making or backtracking. 

Requires: 2.7+, 3.3+, PyPy
