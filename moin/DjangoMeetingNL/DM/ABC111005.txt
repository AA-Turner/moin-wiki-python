On '''Wednesday 5 October''' we will meet again! Following our very first general Assembly (Algemene Ledenvergadering), we kick off a brand new Django season with an exciting sixth episode of the Django Meetup.

Feel free to join us, everybody who likes to (or is forced to) program in Django is welcome. Heck, even if you love Ruby on Rails, just join us and convert. 

The location opens at '''19:00''', feel free to come early and have a beer beforehand while it is still lukewarm. Talks start at '''19:30''' p√ºnktlich so please be on time. We are seated on the second floor of our sponsor '''[[http://www.treehouse.abc.nl/index.php?page=location|ABC Treehouse in Amsterdam]]''', thanks again for hosting us.

Presentation end around 22:30 hours, and then it's time for another (third/fourth/nth) beer. At approximately 23:30 hours everyone is kicked out of the building and we leave to dream a beautiful sleep of Django, dear Django.

If you are attending, '''please leave your name below'''. Even better, if you think you have something interesting to talk about - if you can just hear this eeny weeny tiny voice in your head yelling on top of its voice: "Yes you can!" - then don't hesitate: '''just fill a blank presentation''', because we would love to hear from you. Sincerely, we do.

If you have any questions, just contact one of the organisors, Remco Wendt, Klaas van Schelven or Wim Feijen: wim at go2people dot nl.
