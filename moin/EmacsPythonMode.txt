[[https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode|python-mode]] (python-mode.el) is a major mode for editing Python with the EmacsEditor.  It is a separate mode from the Python mode included in GNU Emacs, known as python.el, and can be installed as an alternative.

python-mode is available on MELPA as [[https://melpa.org/#/python-mode|python-mode]].  

The !EmacsWiki page EmacsWiki:ProgrammingWithPythonModeDotEl has information on how to install, configure and add shortcuts keys.  An example how to setup a complete IDE around python-mode was shown at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZ7szFuz18If|EuroPython 2013]].
