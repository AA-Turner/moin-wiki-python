=== How can I run Uncomment Region? ===

The handy Uncomment Region command does not have a shortcut key. Actually, you can not run it from the command line at all! If you look into the python-mode description (C-h m), you will find that there is no such command.  

There are (at least) three solutions:

 1. Prefix the Comment Region command with C-u, like this: C-u C-c #
 2. If you really want to save this extra C-u and have a shortcut like C-c 3, put this elisp code into your .emacs file:

{{{
;; The missing key shortcuts for Uncomment Region
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () 
    (define-key py-mode-map "\C-c3" 
      (lambda (beg end) (interactive "r")
        (py-comment-region beg end '(4))))))
}}}
 
 III. Rectangles.  Place point and mark at opposing corners of a comment region.  C-x r d   will kill the offending # signs.  C-x r o   can be used against a region to usher code back into ranks.  C-h a "rectangle" and [http://www.emacswiki.org] are your friends.

..no?
