Hello! I'm Leonard. This is my first conference talk. I'll keep this
page updated with information as I scramble to get the talk and the
corresponding software written in time. :)

If you're interested in me personally, you can visit [http://www.crummy.com/ my homepage].

The purpose of my talk is to get more of the world's configuration
data out of configuration files and into web interfaces. Web
interfaces are easier to use, can enforce semantics, and don't require
shell access to the hosting machine. The framework I'll describe is
also useful for doing a user preferences engine.

The framework I'm using in my talk is based on the one I wrote for [http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/ NewsBruiser].
[http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/source/browse/newsbruiser/nb/Options.py Here it is in CVS.] 


My talk is currently [http://www.python.org/pycon/pycon-schedule.html scheduled]
for 11:30-12:00 on Thursday, March 27, in the Elliot room, wherever
that is. I assume there will be signs.
