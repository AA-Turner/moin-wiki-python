I am also Doug on several Wikimedia projects and I run Doug``Bot and Interwiki``Bot, two [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipediabot|Pywikipediabot]] based wiki editing bots on several [[http://mediawiki.org|mediawiki]] based wikis, including [[http://wikisource.org|wikisource]], [[http://wwww.wikilivres.info|wikilivres]] (a private (non-WMF) auxiliary to wikisource with servers in Canada), and [[http://botwiki.sno.cc|botwiki]] - a wiki for the development and testing of wiki editing bots and related scripts, the most popular of which is the [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipediabot|PyWikipediaBot]] (PWB), a Python bot framework designed for editing mediawiki based wikis.

I have become reasonably capable with RegularExpression``s, though I don't really know much Python yet, getting assistance from others to develop simple scripts for Py``Wikipedia``Bot.  I use Python 2.6 on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). 

In addition to English, I can manage to communicate in writing at a basic level in German and French.
