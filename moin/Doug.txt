I am also Doug on several Wikimedia projects and I run DougBot and InterwikiBot, two [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipediabot|Pywikipediabot]] based wiki editing bots on several [[http://mediawiki.org|mediawiki]] based wikis, including [[http://wikisource.org|wikisource]], [[http://wwww.wikilivres.info|wikilivres]] (a private (non-WMF) auxiliary to wikisource with servers in Canada), [[http://botwiki.sno.cc|botwiki]], and [[http://wiki.doughendrick.com|my personal developmental wiki]].

I have become reasonably capable with RegularExpressions, though I don't really know much Python yet, getting assistance from others to develop simple scripts for PyWikipediaBot.  I use Python 2.7 on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

In addition to English, I can manage to communicate in writing at a basic level in German and French.
