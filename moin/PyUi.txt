= PyUi =

Specialized GUI Toolkit for rendering GUIs in Opengl. The widgets themselves are OpenGL elements.

Suitable for game programming. Easy to use.

= Dependencies =

PyGame, PyOpenGl, PIL (PythonImagingLibrary)

= Caveats =

Not yet stable enough for serious production but definitely worth a look.

''September 2004'': last release was version 1.0 in August 2003;
it was released as a zip of an installed tree, byte-compiled for Python 2.2.
The last release in installable package form was 0.95, in January 2003.
Even at the time of 0.95, the portability of at least the openGL renderer was
ruined by a dependency on the Windows-specific WGL extension.
And since most (all?) of the included tests and demos default to using the opengl renderer,
a default install on non-Windows platforms will appear broken.
Might still be worth a look if only because there's nothing much else
available for use with PyGame.  ''MartinManey''
