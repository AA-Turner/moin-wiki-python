Unfortunately it appears that the book links have been lost, we can only hope that the good people at python.org has the list and will update this page in the near future. - ("Oh don't grovel! One thing I can't stand is people grovelling!" SORRY! "And don’t apologies!")

In the meantime a couple suggestions courtesy  of [[http://net.tutsplus.com/|Tutsplus]]

1) [[http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/|Invent With Python]]
If ‘learning by doing’ is your thing, then building your own game will prove to be a rewarding experience! In this book, Al Sweigart assumes no prior knowledge of Python and takes you all the way to building your own game. Given that the book is geared towards game development, the book may move a little quickly for a total beginner. Later on in this article, I mention a similar book of his where he assumes a prior knowledge of Python. If you feel you are have a good grasp of the language, then his other book might be a better resource for you.

2) [[http://www.djangobook.com/|The Django Book]]
If you want to learn Python for web development, then you’re probably going to be using the Django framework. This book assumes fluency in Python, but it teaches Django as if you are a beginner to the framework. The Django Book is as good as they come and will be invaluable for any budding web developer.
