The idea of connecting Python developers on [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn] originated in a message sent by Tennessee Leeuwenburg to the python advocacy mailing list. Here are Tennessee's words:

"One way to help spread Python would be to have a strong presence of Python developers in various online networks. One that springs to mind is [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn], a job related social networking site.

If we could encourage Python developers to start adding each other to their [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn] network, then we shoud be able to create a well-connected developer network with business and industry contacts. This should benefit everyone -- both people looking for Python developers, and also people looking for work."
