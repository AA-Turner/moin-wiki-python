The idea of connecting Python developers on [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn] originated in a message sent by Tennessee Leeuwenburg to the python advocacy mailing list. Here are Tennessee's words:

"One way to help spread Python would be to have a strong presence of Python developers in various online networks. One that springs to mind is [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn], a job related social networking site.

If we could encourage Python developers to start adding each other to their [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn] network, then we shoud be able to create a well-connected developer network with business and industry contacts. This should benefit everyone -- both people looking for Python developers, and also people looking for work."

The best solution would be to create a LinkedIn Group for python developers, rather than indivically adding dozens or hundreds of people (which is not really an option anyway for those who prefer to use linkedin to organize people they have actually met).

But if you prefer to add indivicuals there is a list of LinkedInPythonIndividuals.
