setuptools does many things.  Breaking that down into different areas will allow people to contribute to a smaller chunk that they feel familiar with and excited about.

||Note!  This is the early stages of this.  Feel free to brainstorm or organize at will.||

== metadata ==
This is the metadata about the package that's stored in the egg

=== Ideas ===
 * Enhance metadata with an API/ABI version (ABI would mean, changes to file formats and such)
 * Storage of metadata and data with the same API is not great as there's different storage requirements for each.
 * API for extracting the metadata?
 * Script interface to do the same

== egg format ==
This is the format of metadata + code + data that is zipped up into an egg.

== pkg_resources: Library Dependency Manager ==
This is the functionality that loads libraries of certain versions and runs them,

=== Ideas ===
 * Be able to both control version choices programmatically and have a default version
 * Properly handle overlapping dependencies

== pkg_resources: Resource Manager ==
Allow code to import data from an unknown and variable location on the disk.

=== Ideas ===
 * Ability to retrieve data from outside of the Module (EggTranslations)
 * General data store
 * Ability to access data in different locations per platform and install method

== easy_install ==
Tool that downloads and installs all the dependencies of a package

== build ==
Tool that makes building and installing from source easier

=== Ideas ===
 * Able to install to FHS locations or build eggs as desired
