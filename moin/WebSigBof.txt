A BoF to talk about things that have come up on the Web-SIG list, or for that matter anything related to the Web SIG "mission".  

[[[http://www.python.org/sigs/web-sig/|Web-SIG page]]]

Maybe that would cover anyone using Python on the web?  

Specific possible topics of discussion: 
 * The Web Container Interface specification as proposed on the list
 * HTTP Request and Response objects
 * Why we aren't really getting anything done on the Web-SIG list
 * Unifying frameworks
 * Layering frameworks
 * Whatever
