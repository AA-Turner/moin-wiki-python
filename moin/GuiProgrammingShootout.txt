To compare libraries, it is often useful to have the same problem implemented using different libraries.

This could be one medium size application (this has been discussed in com.lang.python). But it could also be demo implementations of common GUI related tasks:

  * certain effects using layout managers
  * dynamic menus
  * loading key bindings from a configuration file (and changing menu labels and tooltips accordingly)

This could actually be the start of a cookbook for each toolkit.
