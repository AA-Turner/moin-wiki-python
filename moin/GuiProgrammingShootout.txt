To compare libraries, it is often useful to have the same problem implemented using different libraries.

This could be one medium size application (this has been discussed in com.lang.python). But it could also be demo implementations of common GUI related tasks:

  * certain effects using layout managers
  * dynamic menus
  * loading key bindings from a configuration file (and changing menu labels and tooltips accordingly)

This could actually be the start of a cookbook for each toolkit.

Not sure the right spot for this addition, but I'm looking for a comparision of Python vs. REALBasic for GUI Application development TIA, -- Dean goodmansond@yahoo.com

 Python is free and open source and has hundreds more of (also free) libraries available.  If you want a free (for Linux) GUI builder that is most similar to REALBasic & Visual Basic, see QT Designer and PyQt.  To use QT Designer on Windows, see BlackAdder, but it is not free then.  For Windows development though, WxPython is probably better than Py``Qt.  PyGtk is also very nice.
