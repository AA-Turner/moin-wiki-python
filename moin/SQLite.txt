== DB API 2.0 Drivers ==

=== pysqlite ===

  URL:: http://pysqlite.org/
  SourceForge:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysqlite
  licence:: zlib/libpng License
  platforms:: Windows 95/98/2000/XP, POSIX, MacOS X
  Python versions:: 2.1 or later (1.x branch)/2.3 or later (2.0 branch).  Included in Python 2.5.

==== Extensions to DB API ====

  * Extensible type conversion
  * Factories for connection and cursor objects
  * row converter factory to easily and efficiently switch to a nonstandard type for rows (e. g. dicts)
  * User-defined functions and aggregates

== Other Drivers ==

=== APSW ===

  URL:: http://www.rogerbinns.com/apsw.html
  licence:: zlib/libpng license
  platforms:: Windows, POSIX
  Python versions:: ?

==== Programming Model ====

APSW is a SQLite 3 wrapper that provides a thin layer over SQLite 3. Although APSW looks vaguely similar to the DBAPI, it is not compliant with that API and instead mirrors the way SQLite 3 works.

==== Comments ====

== Supported Python Applications ==

 * Thuban (GIS application)
 * Roundup (issue tracker)
 * PyPI (Python Package Index)
 * Trac (issue tracker, wiki, Subversion web frontend)
 * Cloud Wiki (wiki)
 * Supybot (IRC bot framework)
 * PyAddbook (Address Book)

== Pros ==

I think SQLite may be a good replacement for gadfly, because:

 * the main engine is written in C, so it should be faster than the gadfly implementation in Python
 * it's extensible in a very easy way via Python 
 * it doesn't put all data in memory like gadfly does (yet you can do that if you want, just use ':memory:' as filename
 * It's very cool for small databased application, because you do not have to start an external DBMS
 * Implements almost all of SQL92

== Cons ==

 * SQLite only supports the basic types NULL, INTEGER, FLOAT, TEXT and BLOB
 * If you want to use other types like DATE and TIME in pysqlite, you need to use its "pysqlite types mode", where things can get a little nastier.
