== Pros ==

I think SQLite may be a good replacement for gadfly, because:

 * the main engine is written in C, so it should be faster than the gadfly implementation in Python
 * it's extensible in a very easy way via Python 
 * it dosn't put all data in memory like gadflay does (yet you can do that if you want, just use ':memory:' as filename
 * It's very cool for small databased application, because you do not have to start an external DBMS
 * Implements almost all of SQL92

== Cons ==

 * Untyped! (this is also a feature)
