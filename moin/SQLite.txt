= SQLite =

 URL:: http://sqlite.org/
 licence:: Sources are uncopyrighted. Use for any purpose.
 platforms:: Built and tested under Linux and Win2K.

== Pros ==

I think SQLite may be a good replacement for gadfly, because:

 * The main engine is written in C, so it should be faster than the gadfly implementation in Python
 * It's extensible in a very easy way via Python
 * It doesn't put all data in memory like gadfly does (yet you can do that if you want, just use ':memory:' as filename
 * It's very cool for small databased application, because you do not have to start an external DBMS
 * Implements almost all of SQL92

== Cons ==

 * SQLite only supports the basic types NULL, INTEGER, FLOAT, TEXT and BLOB
 * If you want to use other types like DATE and TIME in pysqlite, you need to use its "pysqlite types mode", where things can get a little nastier.

== DB API 2.0 Drivers ==

=== pysqlite ===

 URL:: http://pysqlite.org/
 SourceForge:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysqlite
 licence:: zlib/libpng License
 platforms:: Windows 95/98/2000/XP, POSIX, MacOS X
 Python versions:: 2.1 or later (1.x branch)/2.3 or later (2.0 branch). Included in Python 2.5.

==== Extensions to DB API ====

 * Extensible type conversion
 * Factories for connection and cursor objects
 * row converter factory to easily and efficiently switch to a nonstandard type for rows (e. g. dicts)
 * User-defined functions and aggregates

== Other Drivers ==

=== APSW ===

 URL:: http://code.google.com/p/apsw/
 licence:: zlib/libpng license
 platforms:: Windows, POSIX
 Python versions:: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0 9 (ie all versions from 2.3 onwards)

==== Programming Model ====

APSW is a SQLite 3 wrapper that provides a thin layer over SQLite 3. Although APSW looks vaguely similar to the DBAPI, it is not compliant with that API and instead mirrors the way SQLite 3 works.  APSW gives all functionality of the SQLite C API including Virtual Tables, Virtual File System (VFS) and BLOB I/O.  There is more detailed documentation about the differences between pysqlite and APSW at http://apsw.googlecode.com/svn/publish/pysqlite.html

== Supported Python Applications ==

 * Thuban (GIS application)
 * Roundup (issue tracker)
 * PyPI (Python Package Index)
 * Trac (issue tracker, wiki, Subversion web frontend)
 * Cloud Wiki (wiki)
 * Supybot (IRC bot framework)
 * PyAddbook (Address Book)

== Usage Notes ==
The following solution was difficult to discover with the available documentation (http://pysqlite.org/ was unavailable). If this page can be found by others searching for answers, it may save many hours of frustration.

=== Id of Most Recent Row ===
After creating a new row in a table that uses AUTOINCREMENT to create the PRIMARY KEY, one may wish to determine the value of the new row-id, for example if the value is need for a new row in a related table that will be inserted next. The answer is to use the ''lastrowid'' property of the ''cursor'' class as in   {{{newId=c.lastrowid }}} shown below in a demo context. Tested in Python2.5.1 with the sqlite3 module:

{{{
           import sqlite3
           con = sqlite3.connect('demo.db')
           con.execute("""CREATE TABLE tbl (
               id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
               grp INTEGER)""")
           c = con.cursor()
           c.execute("""INSERT INTO tbl (grp) VALUES (0);""")

           newId = c.lastrowid

           print "New rowid =", newId
           c.close()
           con.close()
}}}
The result is printed:{{{ New rowid = 1}}}
