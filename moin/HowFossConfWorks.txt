== This is a brief description of how the FossConf software works. ==

=== Philosophy ===

The software aims at helping to conduct a conference in the most transparent possible way, at the same time has enough controls to prevent anarchy and chaos. The workflow is as follows:

 * The general public can view all the content of the site. If anyone wants to interact with the site, he must register. The registration process is designed to keep out bots. Manual spammers will have to be manually dealt with.

 * Once a user registers he has to fill in his profile - only occupation and lastname are mandatory fields. When he does so, he becomes a delegate and gets listed on the site. Date of registration is also listed to avail of early-bird discounts. The list of non-delegate users and email addresses of everyone is available only to select admins. 

 * The software does not distinguish between delegates, speakers, volunteers etc.

 * A delegate may offer to speak - he does so by adding one or more talks. There can be multiple speakers for a talk.

 * A list of all proposed talks is available and can be rated. Only registered users can rate and it is one man one vote. The user cannot change his rating (if he wants to he has to ask the admins). 

 * A speaker may edit his talk/details at any time.

 * He will have to ask the admins to delete his talk if he wants it deleted.

 * Acceptance of talks can only be done by the admins. 

 * The talk scheduling takes care of allotting talks to halls and will be done by the admins. Scheduling can be changed at any time

 * Talks can be tagged - and will be allotted a colour depending on the tag
