= PyKDE =

PyKDE, written and actively maintained by Jim Bublitz, is a full interface to KDE's libraries. This allows you to write fully-fledged KDE applications with python.

PyKDE needs PyQt and ["SIP"] to run. These are both actively maintained by Phil Thompson.

More information is available at [http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/].

If you have written an application for PyKDE, please list it here:

 * The PyQt Wiki contains a [http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/SomeExistingApplications list of applications using PyQt and/or PyKDE].
