= PyKDE =

PyKDE, written and actively maintained by Jim Bublitz, is a full interface to KDE's libraries. This allows you to write fully-fledged KDE applications with python.

PyKDE needs PyQt and [[SIP]] to run. These are both actively maintained by Phil Thompson.

Documentation is available at [[http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk|Riverbank Computing Limited]].

If you have written an application for PyKDE, please list it here:

 * The PyQt Wiki contains a [[http://www.diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki/SomeExistingApplications|list of applications using PyQt and/or PyKDE]].
