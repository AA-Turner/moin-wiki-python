=== Long file support on Linux ===
 
(Not a diff or patch, but worth a mention.)

On some Linux systems, you can enable long support as follows:

    export CC="-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64";
    ./configure

But then file.tell() may return negative numbers for positions over 2G,
due to an apparent libc bug.  As a work-around, change the function
_portable_ftell() in Objects/fileobject.c to use the fgetpos() case.
