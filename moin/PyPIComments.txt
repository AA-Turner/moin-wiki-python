The Python Package Index currently provides a feature where users can comment on individual packages. Some package maintainers are opposed to such a feature, and would like to leave activation of the feature the maintainer. Along with comments, there is also support for rating the package with a number of 0..5; this feature is not debated. This page discusses arguments in favor and against per-package comments.

= Pro comments =

 * users posting a rating not only want to indicate whether they like or dislike the package, but also why they rated the package in the way they did.
 * restricting users (not allowing them comment on certain packages) can be considered as a form of censorship
 * spam is largely prevented by requiring user to login; if spam (i.e. completely unrelated comments) are made, they can be deleted.
 * if users use the facility to report bugs, the package author should have more clear directions to point users to the bug reporting channels
 * new comments will be emailed to the maintainers to notify them

= Contra comments =

 * maintainers need to check one more place for discussion of the package, in addition to mailing lists and fora that they already operate; people are too lazy to research what the proper comment reporting channel is.
 * if PyPI would allow individual packages to opt out of commenting, then comments would still be possible on packages that want them (or don't mind receiving them).
 * if comments get posted, the maintainer should have the ability to delete comments that are inappropriate.
