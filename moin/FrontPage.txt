= The Python Wiki =


[[http://www.python.org/|Python]] is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often [[LanguageComparisons|compared]] (favorably of course :-) ) to Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java... and it's much more fun.

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to [[GUI Programming in Python|various windowing systems]]. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen [[PythonImplementations|implementation]]). Python is also usable as an extension language for [[AppsWithPythonScripting|applications written in other languages]] that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.

== Using this Wiki ==

This Wiki is a community place to gather and organize all things about Python. Feel free to exercise your editorial skills and expertise to make it a useful knowledge base and up-to-date reference on all Python-related topics.

There are some [[WikiGuidelines|guidelines]] describing the policies and rules governing this Wiki and how you can most effectively contribute to it. A list of [[SiteImprovements|site improvements]] describes various tasks where your help would be appreciated.

'''If you want to edit a page''' and have just signed up, or you find that you can no longer edit a page that you could edit before, please write to the [[mailto:pydotorg-www@python.org|pydotorg-www mailing list]], stating your account name and your intended edits and we'll add you to the EditorsGroup.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but we want to keep this wiki a useful tool for the community, while at the same time need to prevent wiki admin burnout effects.

=== Wiki Attack in January 2013 ===

The wiki was subject to an attack on January 5 2013. Since it was not clear whether user account data was stolen, all passwords were subsequently reset, so you will have to use the <<Action(recoverpass, password recovery function)>> to get a new password.

See the [[WikiAttack2013|wiki attack description page]] for more details. If you find problems, please report them to the <<MailTo(pydotorg-www@python.org, pydotorg-www mailing list)>>.

=== HTTPS access to the Wiki ===

We have enabled HTTPS access to the wiki to further enhance security and avoid having to send clear text passwords over the network in order to log in to the wikis.

'''If you have not been using HTTPS links to the wiki login page''', please be advised that your password may have been sniffed on the network at e.g. a conference. It is best to <<Action(userprefs, change it)>> and stop using HTTP links to the wiki login page.
