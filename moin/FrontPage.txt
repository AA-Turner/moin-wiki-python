Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, interactive programming language. It is often compared (favorably ;-) to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java.
 
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, a very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typings. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC, Gtk+, Gnome, QT, KDE). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python are also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface (more at PythonAdvocacy).
