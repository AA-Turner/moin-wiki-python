Python is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared (favorably of course :-) ) to Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java... and it's much more fun.

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.

Feel free to add more useful stuff (see HelpContents and HelpOnEditing to learn how), but do us a favour and do tests in the WikiSandBox if you're not accustomed to Wiki technologies. If you're new to wikis, please read WikiWikiWeb. WikiGuidelines contains a few hints on the rules we choose to follow in this wiki.
