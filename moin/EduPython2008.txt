One topic of the meeting Friday might be options for a dinner on Saturday.

Dinner options:

 * If anyone is interested, I can host a visit/tour and/or meeting at the Google Office on Saturday before or after the dinner. - Jessie

Feel free to list your interest in attending either of the above below:

 * VernCeder (both)

 * Dean Goodmanson. In for dinner on Saturday.  I'll be at the Board Games social in on of the open spaces area on Friday and Saturday night.  I can provide some light games if folks would like to continue chats in that environment.
