Possible Meeting times

Lunch Friday is 90 minutes.  The next two days 45 minute talks
overlap it by 15 minutes, so it is down to 75 minutes
Going out to dinner was fun last year.  could be Friday or Saturday.
We have met in the evening.  Saturday would be good.

A difference from last year is that we have Chicago easily accessible from
the hotel!  If people want to go out and see it in the evenings, and not
meet at that time, then I suggest meeting for lunch Friday and maybe a
pre-dinner time.  Or we could all pile on the El and head to Greektown or
....
