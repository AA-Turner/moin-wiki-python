Venom is a project JÃ¼rgenHermann did not come around to activating yet, but its intention is to collect generic, top-quality "functionality". Venom's scope is un-specific functions that can be useful for any other project. For easy re-use, major goals are extensive documentation and unit tests. 

It could thus serve as a breeding ground for future standard library modules.
