Venom is a project JÃ¼rgenHermann did not come around to activating yet, but its intention is to collect generic, top-quality "functionality". Venom's scope is un-specific functions that can be useful for any other project. For easy re-use, major goals are extensive documentation and unit tests. 

It could thus serve as a breeding ground for future standard library modules.

2004/04/15:  The home page for Venom seems to suggest that it is specialized for 3-D graphics applications, not a general-purpose tool.
