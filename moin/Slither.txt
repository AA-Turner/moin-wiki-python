Slither is a light, CGI based Web development framework authored entirely in Python. Our goal is develop the most minimal Web application development platform that is user friendly, fast, and easy to develop and maintain complex and feature filled Web portals.

The authors of this project were motivated by the plethora of complex, slow, and sometimes expensive application servers that are currently available. After a tour of duty in the JSP/Servlet, Zope, and PHP theaters of combat, the authors decided to sit back and analyze the Web portal development lifecycle. Our main question was: What is the minimal set of features needed to get a web application up and running? 

The main documentation for Slither is the book [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130410659 "Web Programming in Python: Techniques for Integrating Linux, Apache Web Server, and MySQL"]].  Highly recommended!
