Slither is a light, CGI based Web development framework authored entirely in Python. Our goal is to develop the most minimal Web application development platform that is user friendly, fast, and easy to develop and maintain complex and feature-filled Web portals.

The authors of this project were motivated by the plethora of complex, slow, and sometimes expensive application servers that are currently available. After a tour of duty in the JSP/Servlet, Zope, and PHP theaters of combat, the authors decided to sit back and analyze the Web portal development lifecycle. Our main question was: What is the minimal set of features needed to get a web application up and running? 

The main documentation for Slither is the book [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130410659 "Web Programming in Python: Techniques for Integrating Linux, Apache Web Server, and MySQL"]].  Highly recommended!

=== Comments ===

Note that there is ''no'' documentation except for that book. The "documentation" link on the website points to the same plug. So, if you want to evaluate Slither by writing a small application in it, apparently you're supposed to buy the book. Yay? ''It is heavily used inside [http://www.hostway.com Hostway]] but probably nowhere else.''
