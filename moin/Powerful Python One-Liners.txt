Powerful Python One-Liners

* Grab a document from the `net:
  * from urllib import urlopen;doc = urlopen("http://www.python.org").read();print doc

I don't like the idea of python "one-liners".  For instance, in the above example, there are actually 3 statments there:

{{{
#!python
from urllib import urlopen

doc = urlopen("http://www.python.org").read()
print doc
}}}

My opinion is that this form is far more readable and clear.  I propose that, rather than go for one-liners, rather go for "powerful code snippets", where we don't try to squeeze stuff into one-line just for its own sake.  Thoughts on this, anyone?
