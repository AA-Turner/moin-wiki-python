= Powerful Python One-Liners =

This is a page that is devoted to short programs that can perform powerful opperations.  The ability to write short programs that are just as powerful as a program written in another lanuage designed to do the same thing.  However, it is sometimes fun to try and write a program in Python that is only one line.  In other lanugages this would be nearly ''impossible'', but in Python it is a lot easier to do.  The trick is to think up something that will "do a lot with a little."  I, personally, would love to see this page expanded to the point where it needs some sort of organization system.

Thanks for Your Code,

Some thoughts by ewo:
 * Want to know how much Byte a Terabyte is? If you know further abbreviations you can extend the list.
{{{
import pprint;pprint.pprint(zip(('Byte', 'KByte', 'MByte', 'GByte', 'TByte'), [(2**10)**i for i in xrange(5)]))
}}}
 * And what's the largest number that can be represented by 8 Byte?
{{{
import pprint;pprint.pprint(["%i Byte = %i Bit = largest number: %i" %(j, j*8, 256**j) for j in [2**i for i in xrange(8)]])
}}}
Cute, isn't it?

=== Decode a base64 encoded file ===

{{{
import base64, sys; base64.decode(open(sys.argv[1], "rb"), open(sys.argv[2], "wb"))
}}}
