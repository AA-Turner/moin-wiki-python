= Powerful Python One-Liners =

This is a page that is devoted to short programs that can perform powerful operations.  The ability to write short programs that are just as powerful as a program written in another language designed to do the same thing.  However, it is sometimes fun to try and write a program in Python that is only one line.  In other langugages this would be nearly ''impossible'', but in Python it is a lot easier to do.  The trick is to think up something that will "do a lot with a little."  I, personally, would love to see this page expanded to the point where it needs some sort of organization system.

Thanks for Your Code,

Some thoughts by ewo:
 * Want to know many bytes a terabyte is? If you know further abbreviations, you can extend the list.
{{{
import pprint;pprint.pprint(zip(('Byte', 'KByte', 'MByte', 'GByte', 'TByte'), [(2**10)**i for i in xrange(5)]))
}}}
 * And what's the largest number that can be represented by 8 Byte?
{{{
import pprint;pprint.pprint(["%i Byte = %i Bit = largest number: %i" %(j, j*8, 256**j) for j in [2**i for i in xrange(8)]])
}}}
Cute, isn't it?

=== Decode a base64 encoded file ===

{{{
import base64, sys; base64.decode(open(sys.argv[1], "rb"), open(sys.argv[2], "wb"))
}}}


=== Editing a list of files in place ===
I came up  with this one-liner in response to an [http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/orr.html article] that said it couldn't be done as an one-liner in Python.

What this does is replace the substring "at" by "op" on all lines of all files (in place) under the path specified (here, the current path). 

 * '''''Caution:''''' Don't run this on your home directory or you're going to get '''all your text files edited'''.
{{{#!python
import sys,os,re,fileinput;a=[i[2] for i in os.walk('.') if i[2]] [0];[sys.stdout.write(re.sub('at','op',j)) for j in fileinput.input(a,inplace=1)]
}}}

Clearer is:
{{{import os.path; a=[f for f in os.listdir('.') if not os.path.isdir(f)]}}}

=== Craming Python into Makefiles ===
A related issue is embedding Python into a Makefile.  I had a really long script
that I was trying to cram into a makefile so I automated the process:
{{{
import sys,re

def main():
    fh = open(sys.argv[1],'r')
    lines = fh.readlines()
    print '\tpython2.2 -c "`printf \\"if 1:\\n\\'
    for line in lines:
        re.compile('(?P<char_to_esc>[\\\'\"()])').sub('\\\g<char_to_esc>',line)
        # grab leading white space (should be multiples of 4) and makes them into
        # tabs
        wh_spc_len = len(re.compile('^(?P<lead_white_space>\s*)').search(line).group('lead_white_space'))
        
        sys.stdout.write('\t')
        sys.stdout.write(wh_spc_len/4*'\\t'+line.rstrip().lstrip())
        sys.stdout.write('\\n\\\n')
    print '\t\\"`"'

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
}}}

This script generates a "one-liner" from make's point of view.
