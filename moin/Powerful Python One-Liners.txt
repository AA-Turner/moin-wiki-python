= Powerful Python One-Liners =

This is a page that is devoted to short programs that can perform powerful operations.  The ability to write short programs that are just as powerful as a program written in another language designed to do the same thing.  However, it is sometimes fun to try and write a program in Python that is only one line.  In other languages this would be nearly ''impossible'', but in Python it is a lot easier to do.  The trick is to think up something that will "do a lot with a little."  I, personally, would love to see this page expanded to the point where it needs some sort of organization system.

Thanks for Your Code,
[[JAM]]

Of course, there is debate on whether one-liners are even ''Pythonic''.

Some thoughts by ewo:
 * Want to know many bytes a terabyte is? If you know further abbreviations, you can extend the list.
{{{
import pprint;pprint.pprint(zip(('Byte', 'KByte', 'MByte', 'GByte', 'TByte'), (1 << 10*i for i in xrange(5))))
}}}
 * And what's the largest number that can be represented by 8 Byte?
{{{
print '\n'.join("%i Byte = %i Bit = largest number: %i" % (j, j*8, 256**j-1) for j in (1 << i for i in xrange(8)))
}}}
Cute, isn't it?

=== Set of all subsets ===
 * Function that returns the set of all subsets of its argument
{{{
f = lambda x: [[y for j, y in enumerate(set(x)) if (i >> j) & 1] for i in range(2**len(set(x)))]
}}}
<<BR>>
{{{
>>>f([10,9,1,10,9,1,1,1,10,9,7])
[[], [9], [10], [9, 10], [7], [9, 7], [10, 7], [9, 10, 7], [1], [9, 1], [10, 1], [9, 10, 1], [7, 1], [9, 7, 1], [10, 7, 1], [9, 10, 7, 1]]
}}}

Alternately (shorter, more functional version):
{{{
f = lambda l: reduce(lambda z, x: z + [y + [x] for y in z], l, [[]])
}}}

=== Decode a base64 encoded file ===

{{{
import base64, sys; base64.decode(open(sys.argv[1], "rb"), open(sys.argv[2], "wb"))
}}}


=== Editing a list of files in place ===
I came up  with this one-liner in response to an [[http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/orr.html|article]] that said it couldn't be done as an one-liner in Python.

What this does is replace the substring "at" by "op" on all lines of all files (in place) under the path specified (here, the current path). 

 * '''''Caution:''''' Don't run this on your home directory or you're going to get '''all your text files edited'''.
{{{#!python
import sys,os,re,fileinput;a=[i[2] for i in os.walk('.') if i[2]] [0];[sys.stdout.write(re.sub('at','op',j)) for j in fileinput.input(a,inplace=1)]
}}}

Clearer is:
{{{import os.path; a=[f for f in os.listdir('.') if not os.path.isdir(f)]}}}

=== Reimplementing cut ===

Print every line from an input file but remove the first two fields.

{{{
python -c "import sys;[sys.stdout.write(' '.join(line.split(' ')[2:])) for line in sys.stdin]" < input.txt 
}}}

=== Cramming Python into Makefiles ===
A related issue is embedding Python into a Makefile.  I had a really long script
that I was trying to cram into a makefile so I automated the process:
{{{
import sys,re

def main():
    fh = open(sys.argv[1],'r')
    lines = fh.readlines()
    print '\tpython2.2 -c "`printf \\"if 1:\\n\\'
    for line in lines:
        line = re.sub('[\\\'\"()]','\\\g<0>',line)
        # grab leading white space (should be multiples of 4) and makes them into
        # tabs
        wh_spc_len = len(re.match('\s*',line).group())
        
        sys.stdout.write('\t')
        sys.stdout.write(wh_spc_len/4*'\\t'+line.rstrip().lstrip())
        sys.stdout.write('\\n\\\n')
    print '\t\\"`"'

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
}}}

This script generates a "one-liner" from make's point of view.  

== echo unicode character: ==
{{{
python -c "print unichr(234)"
}}}
This script echo "Ãª"


== Apply regular expression to lines from stdin ==
{{{
[another command] | python -c "import sys,re;[sys.stdout.write(re.sub('PATTERN', 'SUBSTITUTION', line)) for line in sys.stdin]"
}}}

== Modify lines from stdin using map ==
{{{
python -c "import sys; tmp = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x.split()[0]+'\t'+str(int(x.split()[1])+1)+'\n'); map(tmp, sys.stdin);"
}}}

== Display List of all users on Unix like system ==
{{{
print '\n'.join(line.split(":",1)[0] for line in open("/etc/passwd"))
}}}

== Compress CSS file ==
{{{
python -c 'import re,sys;print re.sub("\s*([{};,:])\s*", "\\1", re.sub("/\*.*?\*/", "", re.sub("\s+", " ", sys.stdin.read())))'
}}}
