= Powerful Python One-Liners =

This is a page that is devoted to short programs that can perform powerful opperations.  The ability to write short programs that are just as powerful as a program written in another lanuage designed to do the same thing.  However, it is sometimes fun to try and write a program in Python that is only one line.  In other lanugages this would be nearly ''impossible'', but in Python it is a lot easier to do.  The trick is to think up something that will "do a lot with a little."  I, personally, would love to see this page expanded to the point where it needs some sort of organization system.

Thanks for Your Code,
