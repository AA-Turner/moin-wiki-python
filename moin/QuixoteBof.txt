The Quixote BoF session will be a rare chance for users and developers of Quixote to chat.

Possible discussions:

* Plans for Quixote 1.0 (that is, [http://www.quixote.ca/qx/RoadMap the roadmap])


Additional suggestions?

-----

* +1 on the roadmap dicussion.

* form2 "roadmap"

* discussion of the sandbox idea? Can we set up a semi-permanent one? What code can we contribute? Small but complete examples of Quixote-driven apps, esp. showing different ways of connecting to data sources (rdbms, zodb, etc.)?

* are there some HOWTO documents that we could outline, for addition to the Wiki?

* discussing the Nevow syntax: is there interest? should we maintain our own, or wait for the Twisted version & integrate it?

* thoughts on a "Powered By Quixote" button?
