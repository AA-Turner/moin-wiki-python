I am a Python dabbler since early 2003.  Most recently, I've been supporting the pyparsing module, for creating recursive-descent parsers 
(http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net).

I live in Austin, Texas, with my wife and 2 kids, and work at a small consultancy doing software planning, development, and deployment projects for semiconductor manufacturing companies and their suppliers.
