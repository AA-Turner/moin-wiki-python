16:13:49 on < techno_freak> anandbpillai, if he still follows his standards, he should have gone to bed by now
16:14:05 on < Khmar> lawgon is Kenneth?
16:14:17 on < techno_freak> yes
16:14:25 on < munichlinux> Khmar, na kenneth is lawgon
16:14:32 on <@ramkrsna> anandbpillai, lawgon isnt there, he left a message before that he would be logging the discussion
16:14:43 on < Khmar> 'is' is symmetric in this context.
16:15:17 on < munichlinux> ok replace is with ==
16:15:21 on <@ramkrsna> heh
16:15:32 on -!- Casanova [n=prmohan@unaffiliated/casanova] has quit ["leaving"]
16:15:38 on <@ramkrsna> I guess we'll start at 9 sharp
16:16:07 on < munichlinux> ok
16:16:16 on < anandbpillai> fine
16:16:17 on < Khmar> from __future__ import meeting
16:16:30 on < anandbpillai> reddy, u be the mod, i can take over if u leave
16:17:17 on < Khmar> You can use the agenda I sent or another but I think it would be a good idea to sent it to the list beforehand so that we all stay on the same page.
16:17:20 on < anandbpillai> anyone want to leave anytime can >>>import antigravity
16:17:30 on -!- anandology [n=anandolo@59.92.160.150] has quit [Connection timed out]
16:17:48 on < Khmar> Is Sidu here?
16:17:57 on <@ramkrsna> okey. I might need someone else. I have a flaky power situation to moderate and a volunteer to log it
16:18:07 on <@ramkrsna> and post it back to the list
16:18:13 on < falcon74> do we have a "real member" count on this channel ?? 21 seems seeped with anand bloat :-)
16:18:17 on < techno_freak> ramkrsna, svaksha has volunteered to log, and i did for MoM
