1 PyCon India discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1 Items discussed
====================

1.1.1 Venue
------------
    - Probably at an academic institution.
    - Anand has contacted some folks at IISc. and come up with this
      - It's possible to get the some lecture halls and
        stuff from the college if *one of the profs is there on the
        conference organising committee*.

1.1.2 Format
-------------
    - We are hoping for roughly  14-16 slots among which 7-8 will be
      newbie topics and 7-8 will be advanced.
    - In order to fill slots and make the event richer, we are
      considering open spaces and BOF events.
    - We are also open to lightning talks which can fill gaps and make
      the event interesting.
    - We are planning this to be a one day event scheduled for
      sometime in last September (approx. timeline is there below).
    - We are currently leaning towards not having a keynote
      speaker. If things change, we might consider one later.
    - We are planning to keep a registration fee of Rs. 200 (early
      bird) and Rs. 300 (spot)

1.1.3 Speakers from outside
----------------------------
    - If we *do* get speakers from outside, we will pay for
      accomodation, food and local transport (not for travel).
    - This will cost us roughly 3000 per per person.

1.1.4 Site
-----------
    - We are planning to ask Kenneth if we can reuse the software
      which he has
    - We are planning to get the pycon domain name from the PSF (in.pycon.org)
    - It might be a good idea to ask Kenneth to take over the web
      details completely.

1.1.5 Money matters
--------------------
    - We need an account to hold the funds we gather/collect.
    - Kenneth might be the person who can arrange for us to use an account.

1.1.6 Publicity/sponsorhip
---------------------------
    - We need to leverage personal contacts (companies where we work,
      people we know) to get information about sponsors as well as the
      news to spread through the hacker crowd.

1.1.7 Approx expenses
