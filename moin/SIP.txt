'''Introduction'''

This is by no means an authoritative discussion about SIP. Rather, it is a chronicle of the adventures and misadventures of a bumbling newbie trying to learn to use a great tool with little documentation. Some references that are essential in conjunction to this include: 

 * PyQt: an implementation of Python bindings for Qt. Reading the Sip files for these classes is instructive.
 * [http://www.controlvideo.de/sip/ Sip documentation]. This is by no means complete, but it is currently the best available 

'''A Note About Versions'''

sip has changed from version to version. I'm using python 2.2 and sip 3.0pre7. Depending on the verion you're using, sip will behave a little differently. The most notable addition to the new version of sip is support for classes that are wrapped inside namespaces.
