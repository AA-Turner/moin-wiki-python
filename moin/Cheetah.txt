=== Deployment Platforms ===

Templates are compiled to Python modules, with a Pythonic interface.  The generated template module can also be used as a stand-alone program (which prints the text of the generated page), useful for instance to create a static HTML site.  Templates are true Python objects, supporting inheritence and user-defined methods.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===
Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator. It can be used as a standalone utility or it can be combined with other tools. Cheetah has many potential uses, but web developers looking for a viable alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and PSP are expected to be its principle user group.
