=== Deployment Platforms ===

Templates are compiled to Python modules, with a Pythonic interface.  The generated template module can also be used as a stand-alone program (which prints the text of the generated page), useful for instance to create a static HTML site.  Templates are true Python objects, supporting inheritence and user-defined methods.

=== InTheirOwnWords ===
Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator. It can be used standalone or combined with other tools and frameworks. Web development is its principle use, but Cheetah is very flexible and is also being used to generate C++ game code, Java, sql, form emails and even Python code.

Cheetah has a large and active user community. Products built with Cheetah are used by most of the Fortune 500. One prominent new user is reddit.com, a startup funded by Paul Graham.
