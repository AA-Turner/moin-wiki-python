Discussions about teaching Python, especially to children.

This will be led by [mailto:david@handysoftware.com David Handy].

Intro from David

3 people teaching python, up from 2 last year, 1 the year before. 16 people attending.

David Ahl (David is looking for the teaching programming book by David Ahl). It inspired him to learn how to program.

Teach people programming as early as possible, even if they don't want to become professional programmers.

His high school dropped their programming class.

There isn't a book anymore which will teach a beginner how to program. He was looking for something simple and interactive like BASIC to teach his children. He discovered Python, but there wasn't an entry level book, so he decided to write one.
