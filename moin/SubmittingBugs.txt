= Reporting Bugs in Python =


Python is a mature programming language which has established a reputation for
stability.  In order to maintain this reputation, the developers would like to
know of any deficiencies you find in Python.

##If you find errors in the documentation, please use either the '''Add a comment'''
##or the '''Suggest a change''' features of the relevant page in the most recent
##online documentation at [http://docs.python.org/].

Bug reports should be submitted via the Python Bug Tracker
[http://bugs.python.org/].  The bug tracker offers a Web form which allows
pertinent information to be entered and submitted to the developers.

== Filing a Report ==

The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has
already been reported.  The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the
developers time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that
the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional
information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!).
To do this, search the bug database using the '''search tracker''' box on the top of the page.

=== Log In ===
If the problem you're reporting is not already in the bug tracker, go back to
the Python Bug Tracker. If you don't already have a tracker account, select the
'''Register''' link in the sidebar and undergo the registration procedure.
If you have an account already, enter your credentials and select '''Login'''.
It is not possible to submit a bug report anonymously.

Once you're logged in, you can submit a bug.  

=== Create an Issue ===
Select the '''Create New''' link in the
sidebar to open the bug reporting form.

The submission form has a number of fields.  

* ''Title'':  enter a *very* short description of the problem; fewer than ten words is good.  

* ''Type'': select the type of your problem (note: rfe stands for Request for Enhancement).

* ''Component'' and ''Versions'': select all appropriate to this bug.

* ''Change Note'': describe the problem in detail, including what you
expected to happen and what did happen.  Be sure to include whether any
extension modules were involved, and what hardware and software platform you
were using (including version information as appropriate).

Click '''submit'''

=== What happens next ===

Each bug report will be assigned to a developer who will determine what needs to
be done to correct the problem.  You will receive an update each time action is
taken on the bug.
