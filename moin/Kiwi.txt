Kiwi is a graphical framework for developing applications with graphical user interfaces. It's a set of classes and wrappers for [[http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk|PyGTK]] that were developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Roughly modeled on Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi is not just a research project: its intention is becoming a practical and simple way to make building a UI the easiest and clearest possible.
