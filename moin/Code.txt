There's a lot of useful code out there that's not big enough to be its own module or its own project, but still useful for various purposes.

Until we get a lot of code, this little page can serve as a useful focal point.

["lwickjr"]: I have some code that I would like to share, but am not in a position to participate in the official channels re offering it to the Python standard library. I have descriptions of them on ["lwickjr" my page]; if anyone is interested, please drop me a note ["lwickjr" there].
