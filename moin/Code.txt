There's a lot of useful code out there that's not big enough to be its own module or its own project, but still useful for various purposes.

Until we get a lot of code, this little page can serve as a useful focal point.

 * ThreadProgramming
 * HandlingExceptions, WritingExceptionClasses 
 * SubclassingDictionaries, SortingListsOfDictionaries, KeepingListsInDictionaries, UsingEnumerate
 * StringFormatting, EscapingHtml
 * WorkingWithTime, RssLibraries, UsingPickle, MiniDom
 * CgiScripts, XmlRpc, DocXmlRpcServer, BaseHttpServer, Md5Passwords
 * UdpCommunication

 * PointsAndRectangles - a pair of classes to provide points and rectangles.
 * PatternProgramming - pattern design implementation in python
 * ArithmoGraph - a simple example of functional programming and solution to an interesting problem
 * DiacriticalEditor - Tkinter text widgets with key bindings to enter accented characters easily

We need people to contribute!
