RoundUp is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from KaPingYee in the SoftwareCarpentry "Track" design competition.

I's a SourceForge project, with the lead developer being RichardJones. You can visit the project page at http://roundup.sf.net/ for more information
