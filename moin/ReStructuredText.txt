ReStructuredText is a complete rewrite of StructuredText by David Goodger.

{i} MoinMoin contains an (incomplete) bridge to the docutils's parser, you can try this by using "#format rst" as the first line of a wiki page. See MoinMoin:RestSample for an example. This of course only works when you use the current CVS version, and when docutils is installed.

== Discussion ==

I really wanted to use ReStructuredText for a blogging program. It would take a string of ReStructuredText, and then turn that into an HTML fragment. However, reST seems ''extremely'' resistant to giving you anything but a full HTML document. It's probably possible to get a fragment, but it'd take longer to figure out how than to make my own miniature "structured text"-like language.

Of course, it's very easy to take a full HTML document and extract the body.  It may feel wrong, but it works, and works reliably.  PyDS uses reST successfully for blogging (though I don't know the specifics of its integration).  Here's a little recipe:

{{{
#!python
html = docutils.core.publish_string(
           source=text,
           writer_name='html')
html = html[html.find('<body>')+6:html.find('</body>')].strip()
}}}

You're right- it ''does'' feel wrong. But, it also ''works.'' I'm a satisfied customer. ;)
