= ReStructuredText (reST) =

ReStructuredText is a complete rewrite of StructuredText by David Goodger.

It is distributed as part of DocUtils. [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ (project page)] [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38414 (download)]

{i} MoinMoin contains an (incomplete) bridge to the docutils's parser, you can try this by using "#format rst" as the first line of a wiki page. See MoinMoin:RestSample for an example. This of course only works when you use the current CVS version, and when docutils is installed.

== Reading reST, Writing HTML ==

There's surprisingly little on the web and in the documentation about how to read reST, and output HTML.

IanBicking has contributed this code, which reads a source text (in reST), and writes HTML:

{{{
#!python
html = docutils.core.publish_string(
           source=text,
           writer_name='html')
html = html[html.find('<body>')+6:html.find('</body>')].strip()
}}}

"It may feel wrong, but it works, and works reliably."

There's a more "official" way, that feels less dirty, [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/193890 described at ASPN.]
