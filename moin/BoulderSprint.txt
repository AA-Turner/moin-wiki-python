Thanks to Alex Viggio, Eric Dobbs, and Rob Nagler of bivio for generously providing us this sprint space.

== Projects ==

Complete support for Oracle in Django in time for 1.0. Suggested by Matt Boersma.

Specifically, we would like to build on the good work already done by the Django community to produce a single patch that can be applied to current subversion sources, enabling Django's ORM to pass basic tests against an Oracle database.  The current patches available have Oracle-specific conditional tests in many locations; we will try to confine such code to the django.db.backends.oracle package.

== References ==

The bug report stipulating Oracle support by Django version 1.0 is here:

== Post Sprint Party ==

Some of us are planning to go to the [http://www.bouldercuba.org/ Cuban Connection fundraiser], 6 PM - 1 AM, St. Julien Hotel (our favorite meeting place for FrontRangePythoneers). In addition to raising money for a good cause, this will be a chance to stretch our weary coding muscles while dancing salsa to Quemando and Havana NRG.
