These are the frequently asked questions from the DB-SIG mailing list.

== How do I pass parameters to the cursor.execute method? ==

Don't use the '%' concatenation operator, pass them as a series of extra parameters. For instance

{{{>>> cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = '%s'" % "column_value") }}}

May do what you want, but more by accident than design. If you change it to;

{{{>>> cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = %s", "column_value") }}}

Then the DB-API module will make sure your value is correctly escaped and turned into an object appropriate for the database. 

/!\ Drivers differ in the way the parameters are passed to .execute ()
  * a list: {{{.execute ("... col = ?", ["value"])}}}
  * variable arguments: {{{.execute ("... col = ?", "value")}}}
  * a dictionary: {{{.execute ("... col = :arg", {'arg': "value"})}}}
  * keyword args: {{{.execute ("... col = :arg", arg = "value")}}}

/!\ The substitution value in the statement differs as well. See the paramstyle section (under Module Interface) in the [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0249.html DB-API 2.0 specification]
