When I import Tkinter, Python exits.  Why?

[[lwickjr]]: Several possibilities suggest themselves:

* You don't have [[tk]] properly installed.

* Your version of Python doesn't have tk support enabled.

More information is needed:

* Are you importing [[tkinter]] from plain [[Python]], or from [[I.D.L.E.]]?

* What else is going on when you try this?

Anyone have any other ideas?

I also have a similar problem.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python23\scripts\test.py", line 1, in -toplevel-
    from TKinter import *
ImportError: No module named TKinter

''Check your spelling: it's Tkinter, not Tkinter.  Python's a case-sensitive language.''

I have just installed the Python executable on Win2K.
Here is the info from the IDLE GUI:
Python 2.3.4 (#53, May 25 2004, 21:17:02) [MSC v.1200 32 bit (Intel)] on win32.

I also installed the same version of Python on a Win98 system and I do not have this problem.
TK inter was selected during the installation, so I assume it was installed, but I don't know how to confirm it.

Any help would be appresiciated.

[[lwickjr]]: Does I.D.L.E. work? If so, tk definitely was installed.

I'd go ask on [[http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/|the TkInter wiki.]] -- LionKimbro <<DateTime(2004-09-02T20:03:43Z)>>
