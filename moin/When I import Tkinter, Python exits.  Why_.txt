When I import Tkinter, Python exits.  Why?

Several possibilities suggest themselves:

* You don't have ["tk"] properly installed.

* Your version of Python doesn't have tk support enabled.

More information is needed:
* Are you importing ["tkinter"] from plain ["Python"], or from ["I.D.L.E."]?

* What else is going on when you try this?

Anyone have any other ideas?
