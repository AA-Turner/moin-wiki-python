The idea here is to find out what kind of points of local interest people want to know about.  Local people will gather addresses, hours of operation and details on items that show up here and present it to the Conference in some useful form.

(Do please note that PyCon needs to fill its room allocation; if we don't fill it, 
PyCon will end up paying penalty fees. If you can't afford the room rates, do what 
you have to, but it's better for the conference if you stay in the conference's hotel. --amk)
