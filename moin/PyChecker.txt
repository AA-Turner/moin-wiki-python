Describe PyChecker here.


from http://pychecker.sourceforge.net

PyChecker is a ["static source analysis"] tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages, like C and C++. It is similar to lint. Because of the dynamic nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.
