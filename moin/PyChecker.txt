Describe PyChecker here.


from http://pychecker.sourceforge.net

PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages, like C and C++. It is similar to lint. Because of the dynamic nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.

(Is Pychecker really ''a Favorite of Guido's'' ??)

What are other tools to get some better checking '''before''' you actually have someone test your code ??
