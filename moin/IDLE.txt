IDLE is the Python IDE built with the Tkinter GUI toolkit.  

IDLE has the following features:
    * coded in 100% pure Python, using the Tkinter GUI toolkit
    * cross-platform: works on Windows and Unix
       * Included with http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/ for Mac OS X
    * multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing and many other features, e.g. smart indent and call tips
    * Python shell window (a.k.a. interactive interpreter)
    * debugger (not complete, but you can set breakpoints, view and step)

It is a part of the standard library and is described in the reference manual: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/idle.html

There's also a Chinese version of IDLE at http://www.dohao.org/cgi-bin/site/download/cnidle.cgi.
