I am a student at the University of Minnesota. I am working with the archaeology lab on food residue recovery and phytolith analysis. I am not a computer programmer, but I am teaching myself Python, so I can develop shape recognition software to make our job a bit easier and less subjective. So far, I have been enjoying the learning process and I am really excited to  develop my fist software.
