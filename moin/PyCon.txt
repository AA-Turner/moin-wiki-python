Topics for PyCon DC 2003.

PyCon DC 2003 is not going to be an elitist conference. It needs your help to ensure that there is something for everybody? What can you do? Well, firstly you can contribute your ideas on this very page. It's easy to edit Wiki content, so get to it! The more contributors we have, the more relevant and interesting PyCon DC 2003 will be. A few topics are listed below to get you started, but you should feel free to add others if you believe the PythonCommunities will benefit from having them covered at this, and future, conferences.

=== Sprints ===

The sprints are intended to benefit the Python core, as well as encouraging more developers to take part in Python's development. They will also be a good place to see ExtremeProgramming or other AgileDevelopment techniques in action. What would you like to see done, or at least attempted?

=== Lightniing Talks ===

At IPC 10 the Developer Day had many short talks on diverse topics. If you can't produce a full-blown paper, offer your own talk (as short as five minutes is acceptable) to distil a part of your hard-won experience and save others the learning time you put in. Or just say what you'd like someone else to give a lightning talk on.

=== Volunteers ===

The absence of professional organizers is the main way to keep the cost of PyCon down, but this means we're relying on YOU to help. Volunteer efforts don't need to be all-embracing -- if we can share the load then no one individual needs to suffer a heart attack to make things happen. This section will detail areas where help is needed, and you are encouraged to put your name down to offer assistance. Make it ''your'' conference. Make it ''our'' conference. This is a commmunity effort, and it needs people to ''''get involved''''.

=== Progress Reports ===

There are many areas of Python development where it's hard to stay in touch with what's going on. What would you like to see reports about? Two areas that have already been mentioned are Jython/JPython and the PythonBusinessForum. What else is of burning interest? Who is going to give these reports. Sign up here and help to make PyCon ''relevant'' and ''engaging''. You don't need to be a professional speaker to help other Pythonistas out with a little information.

=== Batteries to be Included ===

There seems to be some interest in building Python distributions that combine the core with various third-party libraries. ActiveState is probably the model here, packaging the Python core with Mark Hammond's win32all extensions and various others. How can this be done in ways that make more people's lives easier and at the same time assist the conference theme of "''''Popularizing Python''''"?
