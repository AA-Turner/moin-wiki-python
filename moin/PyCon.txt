= Chairman's Plea for Help =

Help. Is there a PyConWikiGnome in the house?

["PyConDC2005"] is now coming, and only Skip Montanaro is listening (hi, Skip). Good news: Jim Fulton has agreed to run the Open Space "track" and manage the sprints this year.

See the SteveHolden page for the chairman's current thoughts on organization and content.

= Previous conferences: =

 * ["PyConDC2004"]
 * ["PyConDC2003"]

= Notes from the gnome: =

I've moved the pages linked from ["PyConDC2004"] and ["PyConDC2003"] (at least, those that are specific to them) to subpages. Doing the same for any pages created for ["PyConDC2005"] would save some cleaning next year. -- JohannesGijsbers

''I presume you mean tha rather than having "PyConSpeakers" we should have "PyCon2005Speakers" directly? That's a good idea. What should we then use the "Pure PyCon" (with no year in their names) pages for? - SH''
