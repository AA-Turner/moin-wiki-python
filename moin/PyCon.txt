See ["PyConDC2005"] for more about the upcoming conference.

We are looking for one or more keynote speakers with something of interest and value to say to the Python community.

See the SteveHolden page for the chairman's current thoughts on organization and content.

 * ["PyConDC2004"]
 * ["PyConDC2003"]

= Notes from the gnome: =

I've moved the pages linked from ["PyConDC2004"] and ["PyConDC2003"] (at least, those that are specific to them) to subpages. Doing the same for any pages created for ["PyConDC2005"] would save some cleaning next year. -- JohannesGijsbers

''Many thanks for the gnoming! I presume you mean that rather than having "PyConSpeakers" we should have "PyCon2005Speakers" directly? That's a good idea. What should we then use the "Pure PyCon" (with no year in their names) pages for? - SH''

Information that will still be relevant for the next year. That would mean there would be no "PyConSpeakers" page, but the PyConHelpers page could be useful over multiple years. Oh, and I think using subpages ("PyConDC2005/Speakers") would be better than "PyCon2005Speakers". -- JohannesGijsbers

''Fine, that makes a lot of sense. That's what we'll do. Thanks again! - SH''
