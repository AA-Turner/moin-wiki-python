 * [[ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/pc|this FTP directory]] of generations for MS-DOS, OS/2, and so on;(link appears dead)
 * [[http://www.tucs.fi/magazin/output.php?ID=2000.N2.LilDeEmPy|Deeply Embedded Python]] - a project which once attracted considerable interest, but seemingly abandoned some time ago
 * Jean-Claude Wippler, Jeff Senn, Brian Lloyd and others have worked on tinyPython.  One approach is to exploit "executable compressor" [[http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html|UPX]]: "This gets python15.dll down to 220K and seems to work for me";
