I am a long time Python and Zope evangelist and trainer based in São Paulo, Brazil. Since 1994 I've been developing content-rich web sites. I discovered Python while looking for better way to do object-oriented web development after trying to do it in Perl and Java. I developed the first IDG Brasil dynamic news site in Zope in early 1999. 

After founding and managing a pioneering Zope company in Brasil (Hiperlógica 1999-2003), I decided to focus on training and education. I am now a senior instructor at [http://simplesconsultoria.com.br/ Simples Consultoria]. I am the author of a popular Portuguese-language short tutorial which teaches basic programming with Python. Also, I led the team who translated [http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/ How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python] to Portuguese ([http://pensarpython.incubadora.fapesp.br/] translation).

I am now a 4th-year undergrad student of Library Sciences at the Universidade de São Paulo. I just earned a Google Summer of Code scholarship to develop Circulante, a P2P library to promote book lending among friends. Circulante will be developed in Grok / Zope 3.
