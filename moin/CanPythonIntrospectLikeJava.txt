## page was renamed from I come from a java background. Java has an API that list all classes and their methods that come with Java. Is there anything like that in python?
I don't know ;) but entering the command:

>>> dir()

into the Python interpreter gives a list of defined classes and variables.

Using the TAB key on one of the existing objects opens a list of possible completions, i.e. its methods/attributes.

I'm not sure this is what the OP is asking. I think s/he's referring to the API documentation rather than the API itself. Calling help(object) in the interpreter is a good start for help on an object.
