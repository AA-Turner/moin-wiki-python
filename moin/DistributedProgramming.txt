   '''DOPY''' is a small distributed object system written entirely in Python. It is not intended to be CORBA 
   compliant. Instead, it aims to be extremely easy to use and to support Python's dynamic nature - methods 
   are invoked dynamically, parameters are passed by copy. Any python object that can be pickled can automatically
   be passed as a parameter or a return value, and any Python object can be published as a distributed object.
 * [http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/ omniORB] 
   '''omniORB''' is a robust high performance CORBA ORB for C++ and Python. It is freely available under the terms 
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License (for the libraries), and GNU General Public License (for the tools). 
   It is one of only three ORBs to be awarded the Open Group's Open Brand for CORBA.
 * [http://ose.sourceforge.net/ OSE] 
   '''OSE''' is a generic application framework suitable for constructing general purpose applications, 
   distributed systems and web based services. The four main parts of OSE are an extensive C++ class library, 
   a set of Python wrappers, a build environment based on GNU Make, and a set of documentation extraction tools.
