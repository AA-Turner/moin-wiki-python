A guide and a discussion page for DistributedProgramming using Python.

''You'll find here a partial list of available softwares:''
 * '''[http://www.users.cloud9.net/~proteus/dopy/welcome.html Dopy]'''
   '''DOPY''' is a small distributed object system written entirely in Python. It is not intended to be CORBA 
   compliant. Instead, it aims to be extremely easy to use and to support Python's dynamic nature - methods 
   are invoked dynamically, parameters are passed by copy. Any python object that can be pickled can automatically
   be passed as a parameter or a return value, and any Python object can be published as a distributed object.
 * '''[http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/ omniORB]'''
   '''omniORB''' is a robust high performance CORBA ORB for C++ and Python. It is freely available under the terms 
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License (for the libraries), and GNU General Public License (for the tools). 
   It is one of only three ORBs to be awarded the Open Group's Open Brand for CORBA.
 * '''[http://ose.sourceforge.net/ OSE]'''
   '''OSE''' is a generic application framework suitable for constructing general purpose applications, 
   ''distributed systems'' and web based services. The four main parts of OSE are an extensive C++ class library, 
   a set of Python wrappers, a build environment based on GNU Make, and a set of documentation extraction tools.
 * '''[http://pyro.sourceforge.net/ Pyro]'''
   '''Pyro''' is an acronym for '''PY'''thon '''R'''emote '''O'''bjects. It is a basic Distributed Object
   Technology system 
   written entirely in Python, and for use in Python only. With this, it closely resembles Java's Remote Method
   Invocation (RMI). It is less similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent Distributed Object
   Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI. But Pyro is small, simple and free 
   (MIT software license)!
 * '''[http://www.twistedmatrix.com/ Twisted]'''
   '''Twisted''' is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications. It includes
   implementations of a number of commonly used network services such as a web server, an IRC chat server, 
   a mail server, a relational database interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications 
   using all of these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes 
   a user authentication system that controls access to services and provides services with user 
   context information to implement their own security models.
 * '''[http://maciejsobczak.com/prog/yami/ YAMI]'''
   The '''YAMI''' project is supposed to provide a simple language- and platform-independent alternative 
   to other,   commercially and freely available communication infractructures like COM, CORBA or JavaRMI.
   It's not supposed to become their substitution :), but thanks to much simpler rules it's built on, 
   it can become a useful part in some class of distributed systems, whether they are full-blown 
   object-oriented systems or the simplest client-server solutions.
   YAMI is a complete and consistent environment, and currently supports:

      * Operating Systems: 	FreeBSD, Linux, MS Windows, SunOS
      * Programming Languages: 	C, C++, '''Python''', Tcl
