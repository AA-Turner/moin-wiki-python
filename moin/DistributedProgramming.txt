A guide and a discussion page for Python related  distributed programming.


This [http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=9383481e.0304012011.78f05548%40posting.google.com link] 
points to an informal comparisons of distributed computing technologies, 
including CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, ... in ''comp.lang.python''.

''You'll find here a (partial) list of relevant softwares:''
 === Dopy ===
  * [http://www.users.cloud9.net/~proteus/dopy/welcome.html  http://www.users.cloud9.net/~proteus/dopy/welcome.html] 
    ''Dopy'' is a small distributed object system written entirely in Python. It is not intended to be ''CORBA'' 
    compliant. Instead, it aims to be extremely easy to use and to support Python's dynamic nature - methods 
    are invoked dynamically, parameters are passed by copy. Any python object that can be pickled can automatically
    be passed as a parameter or a return value, and any Python object can be published as a distributed object.
 === Fnorb ===
  * [http://www.fnorb.org/ http://www.fnorb.org/]
    ''Fnorb'' is a CORBA 2.0 ORB for Python first developed by DSTC. Fnorb's claim to fame is its size 
    and pure Python implementation. These features allow it to be used whever Python may used 
    (for example, within Jython) unlike other ORBs that rely on binary runtimes.
 === omniORB ===
  * [http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/ http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/]
    ''omniORB'' is a robust high performance CORBA ORB for C++ and Python. It is freely available under the terms 
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License (for the libraries), and GNU General Public License (for the tools). 
    It is one of only three ORBs to be awarded the Open Group's Open Brand for CORBA.
 === OSE ===
  * [http://ose.sourceforge.net/ http://ose.sourceforge.net/]
    ''OSE'' is a generic application framework suitable for constructing general purpose applications, 
    ''distributed systems'' and web based services. The four main parts of OSE are an extensive C++ class library, 
    a set of Python wrappers, a build environment based on GNU Make, and a set of documentation extraction tools.
 === Pyro ===
  * [http://pyro.sourceforge.net/ http://pyro.sourceforge.net/]
    ''Pyro'' is an acronym for '''Py'''thon '''r'''emote '''o'''bjects. It is a powerful Distributed Object
    Technology system written entirely in Python, and designed to be easy to use. It resembles Java's Remote Method
    Invocation (RMI). It is less similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent Distributed Object
    Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI. But Pyro is small, simple and free 
    (MIT software license)!
 === Python-Orbit ===
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/orbit-python http://sourceforge.net/projects/orbit-python]
    ''Python-Orbit'' is a project to develop Python bindings for ORBit. It supports dynamic loading of IDL 
    (no IDL compiler required), and most of ORBit's Type Codes.
 === Spread ===
  * [http://www.python.org/other/spread/ http://www.python.org/other/spread/]
    ''Spread'' is a toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service that is resilient to faults 
    across external or internal networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, 
    and provides highly tuned application-level multicast and group communication support. Spread services range 
    from reliable message passing to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees, even in case of computer 
    failures and network partitions. Spread is designed to encapsulate the challenging aspects of asynchronous 
    networks and enable the construction of scalable distributed applications, allowing application builders 
    to focus on the differentiating components of their application. 
 === Twisted ===
  * [http://www.twistedmatrix.com/ http://www.twistedmatrix.com/]
    ''Twisted'' is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications. It includes
    implementations of a number of commonly used network services such as a web server, an IRC chat server, 
    a mail server, a relational database interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications 
    using all of these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes 
    a user authentication system that controls access to services and provides services with user 
    context information to implement their own security models.
 === YAMI ===
  * [http://maciejsobczak.com/prog/yami/ http://maciejsobczak.com/prog/yami/]
    ''YAMI'' project is supposed to provide a simple language- and platform-independent alternative 
    to other,   commercially and freely available communication infractructures like COM, CORBA or JavaRMI.
    It's not supposed to become their substitution :), but thanks to much simpler rules it's built on, 
    it can become a useful part in some class of distributed systems, whether they are full-blown 
    object-oriented systems or the simplest client-server solutions.
    YAMI is a complete and consistent environment, and currently supports:

       * Operating Systems: 	FreeBSD, Linux, MS Windows, SunOS
       * Programming Languages: 	C, C++, '''''Python''''', Tcl
