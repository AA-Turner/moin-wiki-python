One of the most-frequently asked questions of all time is this:
"I have a Python application I've developed; how do I deliver it
to my customer/friend/...?"

Here are typical answers:
 * tar up the source and send it.  It's reasonable to expect that the end-user's host will have Python installed.  MacOS comes that way; most Linux distributions do; and it's not onerous to insist that a Windows user install, for example, ActivePython;
 * for Windows, use MovablePython;
 * for this purpose, ["Pyrex"] can be regarded as a language variant to Python itself;
 * ["Freeze"]
 * ["cx_Freeze"]
 * py2app is for Macintosh
 * py2exe
 * Gordon McMillan's installer
 * ...

some of these in 2003.

As of 2007, py2exe perhaps is second in use only to source distribution.
