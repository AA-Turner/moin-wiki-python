One of the most-frequently asked questions of all time is this:
"I have a Python application I've developed; how do I deliver it
to my customer/friend/...?"

Here are typical answers:
 * tar up the source and send it.  It's reasonable to expect that the end-user's host will have Python installed.  MacOS comes that way; most Linux distributions do; and it's not onerous to insist that a Windows user install, for example, ActivePython
 * for Windows, use MovablePython
 *
