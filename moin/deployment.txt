One of the most-frequently asked questions of all time is this:
"I have a Python application I've developed; how do I deliver it
to my customer/friend/...?"

Here are typical answers:
 * tar up the source and send it.  It's reasonable to expect that the end-user's host will have Python installed.  MacOS comes that way; most Linux distributions do; and it's not onerous to insist that a Windows user install, for example, ActivePython;
 * for Windows, use MovablePython;
 * for this purpose, [[Pyrex]] can be regarded as a language variant to Python itself;
 * [[Freeze]]
 * [[cx Freeze]]
 * [[MacPython/py2app|py2app]] is for Macintosh
 * [[py2exe]]
 * PyInstaller (supports Windows, Linux and soon Mac)
 * [[Python-Packager]]
 * [[Esky]] (adds a bootstrap executable and allows to auto-update your applications over the network or from local directory; supports Windows, Linux and Mac)

some of these in 2003.

As of 2007, py2exe perhaps is second in use only to source distribution.
