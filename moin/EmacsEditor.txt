= Emacs =

Emacs (the major flavors being GnuEmacs and XEmacs) is a text editor which
come with good support for writing Python code.  Each has its strengths and
weaknesses, but in general either provide very nice environments for the
Python programmer.

== Tools for Python coders ==

For stupid historical reasons, GnuEmacs and XEmacs come with different major
mode for editing Python code, though both do a fine job of it.
[https://launchpad.net/python-mode/ Work] is underway to unify the two modes.
Please [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-mode get involved] if
you want to help.

Some tools have been written for using Python from Emacs:

  * EmacsPythonMode, a major mode for programming Python in Emacs. 
    * Rudimentary completion is implemented on top of EmacsPythonMode by EmacsPythonCompletion
  * python.el, a Python mode which will be included when Emacs 22 is released, with a number of advantages over python-mode.el. For a version with fixes and enhancements (as of 2006-06) and one that works with Emacs 21, see [http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs].
  * Emacs GUD PDB, support for sourcelevel debugging of Python code in Emacs. (Note: thanx to Ganesan R: Create the following script with the file name as "pdb" in your path so emacs can find pdb and default to filename arguments in the current dirctory: exec python /usr/lib/python2.3/pdb.py "$@")
  * [http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs/Pymacs.tar.gz Pymacs(download)], an extension for allowing Emacs users to extend Emacs using Python, where they might have traditionally used Emacs LISP. ' There are also [wiki:EmacsWiki:PyMacs PyMacs notes on the Emacs wiki.]
  * [http://home.exetel.com.au/peterm Emacs Language Sensitive Editor (ELSE)], an template-based minor mode for Emacs, with templates for Python.
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/oo-browser/ OO-Browser], an Emacs class browser for object-oriented languages with support for Python.
  * The [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/emacspeak emacspeak audio desktop] is a speech interface that allows visually impaired users to interact independently and efficiently with the computer. It has editing support for interactive Python development. Features aural highlighting, structured browsing and debugging. 

== Support for C Python core developers ==

Both Emacs and XEmacs have support for developers hacking on the Python C code
itself.  If you're developing Python 2.x, just use the standard `python` style
that comes with c-mode.  If you're hacking on Python 3.x, you'll want to add
the following code to your `.emacs` file (given by
[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-May/079582.html Georg Brandl]):

{{{
(c-add-style
  "python-new"
  '((indent-tabs-mode . nil)
    (fill-column      . 78)
    (c-basic-offset   . 4)
    (c-offsets-alist  . ((substatement-open . 0)
                         (inextern-lang . 0)
                         (arglist-intro . +)
                         (knr-argdecl-intro . +)))
    (c-hanging-braces-alist . ((brace-list-open)
                               (brace-list-intro)
                               (brace-list-close)
                               (brace-entry-open)
                               (substatement-open after)
                               (block-close . c-snug-do-while)))
    (c-block-comment-prefix . "* "))
  )

;; This is a very crude hook that auto-selects the C style depending on
;; whether it finds a line starting with tab in the first 3000 characters
;; in the file
(defun c-select-style ()
   (save-excursion
     (if (re-search-forward "^\t" 3000 t)
         (c-set-style "python")
       (c-set-style "python-new"))))
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'c-select-style)
}}}

'''Note:''' ''We should try to get the style into upstream c-mode.''
