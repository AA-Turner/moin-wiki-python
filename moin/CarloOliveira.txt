I am a researcher at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). My main work in software automation and educational tools. The project I coordinate is [http://labase.nce.ufrj.br LABASE ](Laboratory for Software Automation and Engineering) (mainly in portuguese). My country (Brazil) is participating in [http://laptop.org OLPC] initiative that has adopted Python as its main deveolpment language. I think this is a major opportunity to Python language to get known and get widespread within honourable cause. So I have started Pyndorama, a project to develop educational programs.

Some ideas below:

 * Live Book - A book that can be edited interactively and turn into a live adventure 
 * A mind map editor - Children can be taught to express their ideas in an orderly way.
 * A python IDE for children - Current IDE may be frightening to children, they need a more friendly one.
 *Artificial Life Word - An artificial life simulator that can be played with to create new lifeforms and see them interact with the world
 * RPG module for Pyndorama - A module to introduce role playing facilities to Pyndorama Live Book
 * Dynamic Systems Modeller - An editor that can model dynamic systems and help children understand the dynamic nature of our world
 * Simple natural language parser - A constrained dictionary/grammatics to use in Life Book adventures
 * Class assistant - A tool to help generate educational contents like lectures, texts, hypertexts, videos or animations
 * Animation assistant -  help to create illustrative animations for educational texts
