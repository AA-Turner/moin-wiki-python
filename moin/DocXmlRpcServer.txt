The DocXmlRpcServer is a ''very'' simple XmlRpc server that is also simultaneously a self-documenting web server.

The benefit of using DocXMLRPCServer is that it automatically creates documentation for your XML-RPC server, just open a browser and head to http://localhost:8000 after starting the server.

Writing a client to call the wait function is left as an exercise for the reader. :)
