YAML may be the most human friendly format for structured data invented so far.

=== YAML examples and usage in notable Python programs ===

YAML is a very feature creep language. Most packages below use its subset.

 * tmuxp - http://tmuxp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples.html
 * ansible - http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/YAMLSyntax.html and http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks.html#id9
 * appengine - https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig and http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/source/browse/app.yaml

=== Full YAML parsers ===

PyYAML - http://pyyaml.org/ - due to complexity of YAML spec, this is the only package that tried to be compliant. It is C-based.

=== Parsers for YAML subsets ===

Luckily, you may not need the full YAML spec. These libraries can parse
only the sweetest parts of YAML spec that you may reuse in your configs.
