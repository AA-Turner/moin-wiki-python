Describe How Tkinter can exploit Tcl/Tk extensions here.





[...]




["Tcl"]/["Tk"] developers have constructed many interesting
widget sets which extend Tk's basic functionality.  A few of
these--["Tix"], for example--are reasonably well known and
accessible to Tkinter users.  What about the rest?  When a
Tkinter programmers sees a promising Tk extension, is it
likely to do him or her any good?

Briefly, yes.  First, it's important to make the distinction
between so-called "pure Tk" extensions and those that involve
(external) C-coded compilation.  Quite a few useful widgets
sets, most notably including ["BWidgets"] and ["tklib"], are
"pure Tk".  That means that Tcl/Tk programmers simply read
them in at run time, with no need for (re-)compilation, 
configuration, or other deployment complexities.

These extensions are nearly as easy for Tkinter programmers
to use.  Here's an example:  . . .























On the other hand, Tix and ["BLT"] are popular Tk extensions which
require compilation.  . . .

Fredrik has pages which he calls "work in progress", but

The latter explicitly extends Tkinter through use of Tcl.
