= Python Writers =

The purpose of this list is to serve as a contact point for those who need something written, and therefore the distinction between professional writers looking for big projects like books and those who want small freelance projects on the side.

If you write in languages other than english, please indicate this in your entry.  We certainly need writers in other languages.
