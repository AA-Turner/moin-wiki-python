= CGI Scripts =

The [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-cgi.html cgi module] is at the core of the Python CGI scripts.

Basically, you just need to print out an HTTP header ("Content-type: text/html"), a web page, and handle any forms you may have received.

Getting Apache's permissions just right can be annoying, and is sadly beyond this page's scope.

== Sample Code ==

{{{
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import cgi
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()  # for troubleshooting

print "Content-type: text/html"
print

print """
<html>

<head><title>Sample CGI Script</title></head>

<body>

  <h3> Sample CGI Script </h3>
"""

form = cgi.FieldStorage()
message = form.getvalue("message", "(no message)")

print """

  <p>Previous message: %s</p>

  <p>form:</p>

  <form method="post" action="index.cgi">
    <p>message: <input type="text" name="message"/></p>
  </form>

</body>

</html>
""" % message
}}}

= Discussion =

  We need a good python CGI framework - Sridhar R
    Nevow and [http://srid.bsdnerds.org/hacking/wallaby/ Wallaby]

    Define "framework," though.  Do you mean something like a Django-type deal or something that just makes it easier to write CGI apps?
----

Yes.... 

There are many frameworks for Python Web Application<br />
TurboGears <br />danjo <br />Zope <br />ModPython <br />Pso <br />Aquarium <br />Cheetah ++++++...

But it would be Nice if python provides native support for 
Session Handling,
JSON - like XML-RPC
Standard Environment for RPC + WSGI
and future technologies.... for Easy Web Development
