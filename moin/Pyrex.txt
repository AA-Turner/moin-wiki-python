Pyrex is a python-like language for writing python extension modules.
It can be described as python with C data types.
You can produce with it code as fast as in C and access to C libraries is easy.

Two main purposes of Pyrex usage are:
  * speed up a Python code
  * provide Python interface to existing C modules/libraries

For an example of speedup see [http://www.eby-sarna.com/pipermail/source-changes/2002q4/000749.html this message].

You can also consider other Python speedup solutions: http://psyco.sf.net and ["weave"].
