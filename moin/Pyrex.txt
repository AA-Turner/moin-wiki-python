Pyrex is a Python-like language for rapidly and easily writing python extension modules.  It can be described as python with C data types.
With Pyrex, one can produce Python-like code that runs as fast as in C, with easy access to C libraries and functions.

The Pyrex homepage is at http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

The two main uses of Pyrex are:
  * To speed up the execution of Python code
  * To provide a Python interface to existing C modules/libraries

For '''examples''' of the speedup that Pyrex provides, see [[http://www.eby-sarna.com/pipermail/source-changes/2002q4/000749.html|this message]]. 
or [[http://www.prescod.net/python/pyrexopt/optimization.html|this page]].

There is an enhanced fork of Pyrex, called [[http://www.cython.org|Cython]]. It features substantial performance optimisations and improved support for newer Python language features.

PyrexOnWindows provides a step-by-step guide to '''Pyrex installation on Windows'''.

[[http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pyrexdoc|pyrexdoc]] is a tool for '''generating HTML documentation''' from a compiled Pyrex module, by DavidMcNab. See other DocumentationTools.

If you are looking for speed improvement, you may also want to consider '''other Python speedup solutions''' such as [[http://psyco.sf.net|psyco]] and [[weave]].

For accessing existing C libraries, the '''ctypes''' module is also available in Python 2.5 and above.
