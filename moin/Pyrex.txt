Pyrex is a python-like language for writing rapidly and easily python extension modules.
It can be described as python with C data types.
You can produce with it code as fast as in C and access to C libraries is easy.

Two main purposes of Pyrex usage are:
  * speed up a Python code
  * provide Python interface to existing C modules/libraries

For '''examples''' of speedup see [http://www.eby-sarna.com/pipermail/source-changes/2002q4/000749.html this message]. 
or [http://www.prescod.net/python/pyrexopt/optimization.html this page].

PyrexOnWindows provides a step-by-step guide to '''Pyrex installation on Windows'''.

[http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pyrexdoc pyrexdoc] is a tool for '''generating HTML documentation''' from a compiled Pyrex module, by DavidMcNab. See other DocumentationTools.

You can also consider '''other Python speedup solutions''' such as [http://psyco.sf.net psyco] and ["weave"].

For access to existing C libraries you may also consider '''ctypes''' module (Python 2.5).
