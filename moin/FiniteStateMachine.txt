This is a summary of FSM implementations in Python right now.

'''[http://fsme.sourceforge.net/ Finite State Machine Editor]'''

This is a tool where you can draw FSM diagrams, and then compile to a Python module (or C++ code.) It also makes an XML description of the FSM.

Requires QT for the editor. (Not the compiler, though, which probably reads XML.)

'''[http://osteele.com/software/python/fsa/ FSA - Finite State Automation in Python]'''

This seems to be all about '''making''' FSMs, but I don't see a whole lot on how to ''use'' them!


'''[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/146262 Noah Spurrier's FSM]'''

This is one found on ActiveState; It's purely Python code. You init an FSM, register transitions, and then throw inputs at it. States and inputs must be hashable.

You can also [http://www.noah.org/python/FSM/ find it on his website.]


'''[http://www.research.att.com/projects/mohri/fsm/doc4/fsmpy.html fsmpy module]'''

This seems to be a Python wrapper around [http://www.research.att.com/projects/mohri/fsm/ AT&T's FSM library.] It's all oriented around "weighted" finite state machines, so I'm not so sure how suitable it is if you just want to use unweighted FSM.


'''[http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary/ Decorator based FSM]'''

A decorator based FSM can be found in the Decorator Library on this site. The module simplifies implementaion of FSM's based on UML 2.0 state diagrams.  The FSM is implemented as a class, with methods of the class associated with transitions or with states. The design is not the best for constructing FSMs to parse text being somewhat slower than alternatives.


'''SkipMontanaro's FSM'''

[http://www.python.org/search/hypermail/python-recent/0667.html From an e-mail.]

Features transition actions.

I've re-interpreted the code, adding formatting lost in e-mail, and PythonStyle-itizing it a bit.
