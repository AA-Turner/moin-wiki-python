Eric Stein (aka Toba) was a PSF Summer of Code student in 2007 to add field dynamics to [[http://www.pysoy.org/|PySoy]].  His work became soy.fields which compliments the rigid body physics provided by [http://www.ode.org/|ODE].

He's available as a mentor for 2009 for students who want to optimize and extend the work he started.
