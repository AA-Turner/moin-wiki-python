Applications can and are written in Python, but people are slow to change, so the vast majority are still done using C/C++ on Linux and Windows and a combination of C++ and Objective-C on Mac OS X. I've noticed a growing trend of using Python to provide user automation or scripting, sometimes called macros, for C/C++ applications. This makes a lot of sense:

 * developers don't have to waste time and money inventing their own scripting language and users don't have to learn a new automation language for every application they use
 * Python is a FreeSoftware (OpenSource) solution and can be embedded and distributed without charge, so there are no royalty payments or licensing hassles
 * Python is simple to learn, yet Python and its standard libraries are much more powerful than a proprietary language like VBScript
 * Python is cross-platform
 * [#head-3 tools] like ["Pyrex"] and BoostPython make it easy to expose part or all of the application programming interface (API)
 * Python scripting can be added to legacy projects just as well as new ones so developers don't have to abandon their old C/C++ code libraries
 * On the Windows platform, Python has an excellent interface to COM (also known as ActiveX) and can be used to interface to almost any COM program (such as the MS-Office suite). Again, Python scripting can be added to enhance a project without change to the existing COM components. (See Win32All)
 * [http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net PyObjC] can be used to add scripting to any Cocoa app on Mac OS X
 * Many Mac OS applications provide Apple event-based scripting interfaces, allowing them to be controlled from languages such as [http://www.apple.com/applescript/ AppleScript], [http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/JavaScriptOSA/ JavaScript OSA], Perl (via [http://search.cpan.org/~cnandor/Mac-Glue/ Mac::Glue]), Python (via [http://freespace.virgin.net/hamish.sanderson/appscript.html appscript]), Tcl and UserTalk. (See MacPython)

For many of the same reasons, Python is often used as the "glue" language for a project. In the Java world, people are using ["Jython"] as the glue and scripting language.

=== Additional Notes ===

After adding Panda3D and Open Inventor I've started to wonder whether those really qualify as apps the way I originally envisioned this list? Perhaps we should have a separate page for C/C++ libraries, frameworks, etc. that have Python bindings? That would include frameworks like GTK, QT, and WxWidgets which have popular Python bindings. Regardless, all the Python bindings available for popular C/C++ tools and frameworks shows the agility of Python. There are great benefits to adding Python bindings to existing C/C++ (and Java) code bases so that you can leverage the power and flexibility of Python without abandoning an existing code base or giving up the speed of C/C++ code. In these cases, Python is a complement rather than a complete replacement for another programming language. -- KevinAltis
