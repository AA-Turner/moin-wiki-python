''Encouraging Comment from PSF Chair''

If half as much time goes into organizing as goes into developing and choosing a logo this is going to be one heck of a conference ;-)
Bear in mind, though, that it isn't the logo that gets people to come back, but the conference content.

It's great to see that the Indian community is moving forward with such gusto. Please let the PSF Board know if you need any assistance.
One of my goals as chairman is to encourage Python development globally.  I hope that one day soon I will be able to visit India and
meet the many people who are investing their time in developing the Indian Python community. ''SteveHolden''
