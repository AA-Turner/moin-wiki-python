I have over 15 years experience using GIS, mainly ESRI software. I was introduced to python as a geoprocessing tool through ESRI's ArcGIS software. I quickly discovered how easy it was to not only create geoprocessing tools for spatial data analysis, but for data retrieval from websites, and other daily tasks using python.

Ultimately my goals are to get a firmer understanding of python, mainly using classes, and incorporating this knowledge into web development with an underlying database.

Python Rocks
