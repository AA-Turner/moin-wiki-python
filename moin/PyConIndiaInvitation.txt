== What is PyCon India 2009? ==

Pycon India 2009 is a community conference by the Indian Python user
and developer community. It is aimed at pythonistas of all shapes and
sizes. The conference is expected to be a mix of Tutorials, General
Talks, Lightning Talks, Workshops and Programming Sprints.

== Who's organizing? ==

The conference is being run by the PyCon India Society, which has been
set up specially for this and future conferences.[Is this being done?]
The Conference and Society have been initiated by BangPypers - the
Bangalore Python User Group

== Why? ==

The idea is to provide a platform for Pythonistas from around the
country to come together and have a fun Pythonic time. The conference
also aims to serve as a rallying point for the python user groups
across India to come together and work on something larger than the
sum of the parts. The event aims to be a local event of a global
scale, giving Indian programmers exposure to world class programmers
and personalities. We also hope to encourage college students to use
python in their work.
