The Omaha Python User Group was restarted in early 2007.  It is composed of local developers (both newbies and experienced) who enjoy learning more about their favorite language and meeting up with other Python programmers.

Our wiki page is here and the mailing list is here: [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/omaha python.org-hosted mailing list].

Well now, that was quite a meeting.  We ended up not talking about any of the announced subjects so it was a very good meeting.  Eli made an appearance tonight [http://eli.criffield.net/] and for a sysadmin who doesn't "program", Eli has produced some pretty interesting python projects.  sipie [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sipie/], Pronounced SY PIE, like "sirius python", sipie is a command line player for Sirius online Internet streaming

We also talked about using private certs and CA's, the different python based packages and use them with the twisted framework[http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/].  Eli hammered out the details and did something with twisted that not many knew was possible.  Thanks for sharing -- Very Cool.

As with previous meetings, kudos to Jay and Reboot The User for graciously donating the space for the gathering.  The new executive conference room is nearing completion -- we will be stylin' then.  Also, props to Todd for covering the pizza guy before I got there. Pizza and Pop sponsored by DM&T.

And finally, thanks to O'Reilly (Marsee) for the great door prize.  Eli won the door prize, "Programming Python" by Mark Lutz.

First Off, a big thank you to Jay and Reboot The User for allowing us to have our meeting at Reboot The User.  It worked out very well - nice seeing your code on a 50" display!  Jay also supplied the Internet access too.

While the meeting was small, I consider it to be successful.  We talked a little bit about PyCon and then moved on to the email2rss project.  There was discussion on the two major packages used, libgmail and PyRSS2Gen module.  You can see the outcome of the email2rss.py project at http://www.dundeemt.com/rss/omaha-rss.xml
Which is a RSS feed of the User Group mail list.

Other elements of the project discussed were:
 * slices
 * pickle module
 * option parsing
 * pylint
 * editors (Komodo Edit/IDE and SciTE)

There was an open discussion about python in the work place.  The consensus seemed to be small skunk-work projects were ideal for introducing the language.  Python's ability to sling data and ability to integrate with sysadmin type scripts make it ideal for this type of assault.

The wiki, mailing list and flyer were shown.  Until the need presents itself, we will continue to use the resources provided by the PSF.  In fact, there is an effort through the Python Advocacy group to enhance user group resources.  Go Advocacy!

There was discussion of the rumored Google-Plex / Council Bluffs.  It was agreed that this would be a good thing for the metro IT community if it is true.  Council Bluffs, IA sits across the Missouri River from Omaha.  A number of our members work in Council Bluffs.

Pizza and Pop were provided by Dundee Media & Technology.  Be sure to mail the list with requests for toppings and flavors for the next meeting, as DM&T will sponsoring the food and beverages for the meeting.


=== Meeting Flyers ===
Meeting flyers are a great way to get the word out about the meetings.  Please post them (with proper approval) in places that might be frequented by past, present or future Python users.
