The Omaha Python User Group was restarted in early 2007.  It is composed of local developers (both newbies and experienced) who enjoy learning more about their favorite language and meeting up with other Python programmers.

Our wiki page is here and the mailing list is here: [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/omaha python.org-hosted mailing list].

Jeff gave a short presentation on the subprocess module http://docs.python.org/dev/lib/module-subprocess.html 
The slides and example code are available on the website. http://www.omahapython.org/
He also gave a little demo of his current internal project showing off subprocess, mod_python and pyRSS2Gen.

There was also a round of talk about using python as a tool to target multiple platforms at once, giving the user leverage to move between those platforms as they see fit.  Also the ability of python to leverage existing code and services.  A number of the attendees illustrated this topic by talking about how they are using python to build on existing resources and integrate systems on the application and OS level.  It is interesting to see Python being used in banks and hospitals.

As with previous meetings, kudos to Jay and Reboot The User for graciously donating the space for the gathering. Pizza and Pop sponsored by DM&T.

The door prize winner tonight, Todd, will receive "Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition" courtesy of O'Reilly.  Unfortunately I left the house in such a rush tonight, that I didn't remember to bring it along.  Todd, if you are going to be at the OLUG East luncheon Friday, I will have it with me and you can get it there.  Otherwise, email me off list and we can make arrangements to get it to you pdq.  

Mark your calendars early, July 12, and don't miss out on the fun.
Here is gCal link so you can add it to your calendar.

We'll be giving away something for a door prize.  There will be food and drink and hopefully many more "lightning" talks about projects by local python developers.

Well now, that was quite a meeting.  We ended up not talking about any of the announced subjects so it was a very good meeting.  Eli made an appearance tonight [http://eli.criffield.net/] and for a sysadmin who doesn't "program", Eli has produced some pretty interesting python projects.  sipie [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sipie/], Pronounced SY PIE, like "sirius python", sipie is a command line player for Sirius online Internet streaming

We also talked about using private certs and CA's, the different python based packages and use them with the twisted framework[http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/].  Eli hammered out the details and did something with twisted that not many knew was possible.  Thanks for sharing -- Very Cool.

As with previous meetings, kudos to Jay and Reboot The User for graciously donating the space for the gathering.  The new executive conference room is nearing completion -- we will be stylin' then.  Also, props to Todd for covering the pizza guy before I got there. Pizza and Pop sponsored by DM&T.

And finally, thanks to O'Reilly (Marsee) for the great door prize.  Eli won the door prize, "Programming Python" by Mark Lutz.

First Off, a big thank you to Jay and Reboot The User for allowing us to have our meeting at Reboot The User.  It worked out very well - nice seeing your code on a 50" display!  Jay also supplied the Internet access too.

While the meeting was small, I consider it to be successful.  We talked a little bit about PyCon and then moved on to the email2rss project.  There was discussion on the two major packages used, libgmail and PyRSS2Gen module.  You can see the outcome of the email2rss.py project at http://www.dundeemt.com/rss/omaha-rss.xml
Which is a RSS feed of the User Group mail list.

Other elements of the project discussed were:
 * slices
 * pickle module
 * option parsing
 * pylint
 * editors (Komodo Edit/IDE and SciTE)

There was an open discussion about python in the work place.  The consensus seemed to be small skunk-work projects were ideal for introducing the language.  Python's ability to sling data and ability to integrate with sysadmin type scripts make it ideal for this type of assault.

The wiki, mailing list and flyer were shown.  Until the need presents itself, we will continue to use the resources provided by the PSF.  In fact, there is an effort through the Python Advocacy group to enhance user group resources.  Go Advocacy!

There was discussion of the rumored Google-Plex / Council Bluffs.  It was agreed that this would be a good thing for the metro IT community if it is true.  Council Bluffs, IA sits across the Missouri River from Omaha.  A number of our members work in Council Bluffs.

Pizza and Pop were provided by Dundee Media & Technology.  Be sure to mail the list with requests for toppings and flavors for the next meeting, as DM&T will sponsoring the food and beverages for the meeting.


=== Meeting Flyers ===
Meeting flyers are a great way to get the word out about the meetings.  Please post them (with proper approval) in places that might be frequented by past, present or future Python users.
