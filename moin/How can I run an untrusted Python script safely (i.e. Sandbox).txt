== How can I run an untrusted Python script safely (i.e. Sandbox) ==

I've noticed that some people mention a Python style sandbox, but nothing concrete.  Here's my problem:

I would like to be able to distribue a Python script to be run on computers that may not trust me (I.E. for use as a Folding@Home kind of distributed application.)

However, I would like my Python script to run in a secured sandbox that would not allow that script (by malice or accident) to damage that person's computer.

Also, I would like to be able to call compiled programs to do work (distribute a compiled C++ module to use hard hard hard calculations as a program, then pass the program parameters to do the work, then retrieve the values from standard out, etc); but again, the compiled programs would be "untrustworthy" and would need to be sandboxed somehow.

And thoughts that could help along with this would be great!  Thanks.
