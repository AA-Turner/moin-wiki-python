These are just some notes about working with processes in Python.

The module of interest is {{{os}}}. [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-os.html (os module documentation)]

Environment variables are accessed through a dictionary, {{{os.environ}}}.

Processes are created with {{{os.popen}}}, [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/os-newstreams.html#os-newstreams described in os 6.1.2.]

{{{
#!python
import os

# Export an environment variable
os.environ["FOO"] = "BAR"

# Make sure environment variable set for child processes
for line in os.popen("bash -c 'env'").readlines():
    if line.startswith("FOO="):
        print line

# Since environment variable "FOO" is exported, and since child
# processes inherit environment variables from their parents, this
# works.
}}}
