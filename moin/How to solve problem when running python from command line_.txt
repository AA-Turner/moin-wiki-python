I just installed Python 2.5.2 on Windows 2000 (SP4) with the windows extensions.
All commands in the program menu are working fine.
However, when I call python from the command line, I always get an error message telling me that the NTVDM-CPU has detected an invalid command. It then gives som numbers for CS, IP and OP and requests to close the application.

What can I do to get the command line python working? I need it to install and use viewVC.

Thanks in advance for any help!
