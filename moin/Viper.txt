= What is Viper =
[[http://www.viperize.it|VIPER]] (Viper Is Python Embedded in Realtime) is an easy to use, professional and performant development suite for the cross-platform and high level design of interactive objects, artistic installations, and internet/cloud connected devices.

Viper is an open source, powerful, easy and affordable way to develop innovative devices and applications based on the ARM Cortex 32-bit micro-controllers combined with other state-of-the-art sensors and actuators, and expansion boards. It enables fast prototyping with leading-edge bards and components that can quickly be transformed into final designs. Programming Examples and reference designs for many applications are provided and they help designers to make the transition from prototype to final product even smoother.

Viper runs on the most used prototyping boards like: Arduino DUE, UDOO, ST Nucleo, Spark Core and Photon, and also on professional hardware based on ARM micro-controllers.

Viper is a solution for creatives, designers and IoT professionals who need to focus their efforts on projects design and ideas without caring about non-added value elements like: low level programming of the particular micro-controller board; device drivers; memory; etc. However Viper integrates a real-time operating systems which also allows designer to use all the features of embedded hardware if required.

Viper is not just another programming library for Arduino associated with a sensor kit. Viper is composed of a set of open source tools developed from scratch in order to allow users to approach to the embedded world in few clicks.

= The Viper Suite Components =
 * The Viper Virtual Machine is the core of the Viper suite. With Viper VM it is possible to develop Python 3 scripts that are virtually independent of the selected hardware platform allowing an high code reusability and integration ([[javascript:void(0);/*1441179156621*/|Viper VM technical details and specifications]]).
 * The Viper IDE is a dedicated development environment. From the Viper IDE users can develop their scripts saving them locally and syncing with the cloud. Through the IDE it is possible to manage all the boards by customizing them and installing the right virtual machines.
 * The Viper APP is a very simple and ready to use mobile application which allows users to monitor Viper based objects from mobile without writing any single line of code for Android or iOS The VIPER App .
