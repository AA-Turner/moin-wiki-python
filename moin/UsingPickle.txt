== Pickle Example ==

{{{
#!python
# Save a dictionary into a pickle file.
import pickle

favorite_color = { "lion": "yellow", "kitty": "red" }

pickle.dump( favorite_color, open( "save.p", "w" ) )
}}}

{{{
#!python
# Load the dictionary back from the pickle file.
import pickle

favorite_color = pickle.load( open( "save.p" ) )
# favorite_color is now { "lion": "yellow", "kitty": "red" }
}}}

For a more complex example, see [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/pickle-example.html the official Pickle example,] and for API details, see the [http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/node64.html official Pickle use documentation.]

== Flying Pickle Alert! ==

Pickle files can be hacked. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, ''don't trust it!'' It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary python when you try to de-pickle it.

However, if you are doing your own pickle writing and reading, you're safe. (Provided no one else has access to the pickle file, of course.)
