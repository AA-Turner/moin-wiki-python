== Flying Pickle Alert! ==

Pickle files can be hacked. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, ''don't trust it!'' It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary python when you try to de-pickle it.

However, if you are doing your own pickle writing and reading, you're safe. (Provided no one else has access to the pickle file, of course.)

== Code Example ==

''Need some simple code here, when it's figured out.''

''Should pickle a dictionary, list, and string. Simple simple simple.''

{{{
#!python
# Relevant Python code
class Something():
  pass

x=Something()
print x
}}}
