As Wikipedia describes, "A how-to or a how to is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish some specific task. A how-to is generally meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic."

These HowTos are intended to give brief, specific, focused, immediate instructions for accomplishing certain tasks with-, or for-, Python.
