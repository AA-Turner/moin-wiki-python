r""" hitlist.py

The glob module lists names in folders that match Unix shell patterns.

If the elemental function emulating Unix bash `echo *` really is missing
from the 2.5 Python batteries included, then here's a brief clear way of
adding that function to Python.

Mind you, to date I've never written an elemental function for Python that
I haven't eventually found well-buried somewhere, e.g., os.urandom.
