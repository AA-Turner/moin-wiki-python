JythonProjects:

Port IDLE to swing. IDLE is a very nice integrated develoers environment. It would be great to have such a nice tool in jython.

A few OS X (or UNIX in general, I guess) Jython suggestions:  

*an installation wizard for tcsh & bash (as a new programmer and someone new to the Terminal, I found installation a real pain) 

*repair issue with jythonc where pure java .class files specified in include statements are not included in the .jar and must be added separately
