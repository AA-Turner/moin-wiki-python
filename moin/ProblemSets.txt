There are several sites on the web which contain problems to be solved in various programming languages.  Some are helpful for newcomers just learning the language, others are challenging for experienced programmers.  Some are useful for practice before programming contests. Here is a list of some of these sites (please add more that you are aware of), along with sub-pages for solutions in python (multiple alternative solutions welcome) and commentary on approaches to the problems, ways to leverage Python and/or the standard library to solve problems, ways in which the problem changes depending on the language you use to solve it, etc.

Thanks to André Roberge, whose post about [http://aroberge.blogspot.com/2008/02/99-problems-looking-for-volunteers.html 99 Prolog Problems] inspired this page.  Further to that post, a [http://code.google.com/p/doctests project] was started whose aim is to collect similar problems written as doctest for [http://code.google.com/p/crunchy Crunchy].

[http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=studenthome Programming Challenges] Companion site to the book of the same name. Has an automated system for submitting solutions in Java, but the problems statements work fine for Python.

[http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems Project Euler] Mathematically-oriented problems.  You can submit your answers (not the program) to be scored on the site, so any programming language can be used.
