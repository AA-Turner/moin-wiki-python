Can you add a link to the `Facebook Group <http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=78464525183>`_ for PyCon'09 in Social Software section?

----

Under Driving and tolls:  In Illinois cash tolls are twice as expensive as tolls paid electronically via I-Pass or EZ-Pass transponders. The main interstates converging on the hotel from the north and south (I-294) and northwest (I-90) are toll roads.  I-90 from Chicago is not a toll road.

----

For attendees arriving at O'Hare, the hotel told me that one should use the "center exit 2" presumably from baggage claim, for ground transportation, and look for a red Crown Plaza shuttle. It runs every 15 minutes. The Crown Plaza phone number is 847/671-6350.

----

The Crowne Plaza hotel no longer offers free wireless access to Priority Club members; that service has been discontinued.  I confirmed this with the front desk upon arrival.  According to the front desk, wireless access has been set up with the hotel for "our group"; I suppose that should be up on the Attendee Notes, unless the front desk was thinking of another group?

----

The "getting around Chicago" page lists 1-800-TAXICAB.  I called that number and was told that Rosemont Taxi ((847) 827-0110) has an exclusive contract with the city/village of Rosemont such that the 1-800-TAXICAB dispatcher can't dispatch any taxis for ''pickup'' in Rosemont.  I called Rosemont Taxi, their taxi arrived within five minutes, and the driver was courteous.

----

For those international travellers arriving at O'Hare Terminal 5, the hotel shuttle bus picks up outside the terminal on stand 27.
