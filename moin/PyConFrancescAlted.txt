= Processing And Analyzing Extremely Large Amounts Of Data In Python =

== Presentation Notes ==

My talk will describe [[http://pytables.sf.net|PyTables]], a Python package
that enables the end user to manipulate easily scientific data
tables and [[http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy|Numeric and numarray]] Python
objects in a persistent, hierarchical structure. The foundation of the
underlying hierarchical data in permament storage is the excellent
[[http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5|HDF5]] library.

I will be walking through the basic features of the PyTables, and
demonstrating the use of the package in real-life scenarios. In addition,
I will present some benchmark where PyTables will show to be competitive
when compared with other persistent databases in Python.

This presentation is currently
[[http://www.python.org/pycon/pycon-schedule.html|scheduled]] for 10am on
friday March 28th.
