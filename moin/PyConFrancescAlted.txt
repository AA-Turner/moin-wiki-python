= Processing And Analyzing Extremely Large Amounts Of Data In Python =

Processing large amounts of data is a must for people working in such
fields of scientific applications as CFD (Computational Fluid
Dynamics), Meteorology, Astronomy, Human Genomic Sequence or High
Energy Physics, to name only a few. Existing relational or
object-oriented databases usually are good solutions for applications
in which multiple distributed clients need to access and update a
large centrally managed database (e.g., a financial trading
system). However, they are not optimally designed for efficient
read-only database queries to pieces, or even single attributes, of
objects, a requirement for processing data in many scientific fields
such as the ones mentioned above.

== Presentation Notes ==

My talk will describe [http://pytables.sf.net PyTables], a Python library that address
this needs, enabling the end user to manipulate easily scientific data
tables and [Numeric and numarray http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy] Python
objects in a persistent, hierarchical structure. The foundation of the
underlying hierarchical data in permament storage is the excellent
[http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5 HDF5] library.

I will be walking through the basic features of the PyTables, and
demonstrating the use of the package in real-life scenarios. In addition,
I will present some benchmark where PyTables will show to be competitive
when compared with other persistent databases in Python.

This presentation is currently
[http://www.python.org/pycon/pycon-schedule.html scheduled] for 10am on
friday March 28th.

I would like to target my presentation as best I can to those people
attending.

So please add questions/suggestions below;  for example:
 * I would attend if ...
 * Will PyTables run on ...
 * etc.
