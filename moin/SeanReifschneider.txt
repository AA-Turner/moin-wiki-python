I've been using Python since 1997, with my primary contributions being the Linux RPMs and related things.  I'd like to be more involved, but running a small business takes up most of my extra cycles.  On the other hand, because it's my business, I get to use Python for most things, but it's Linux System Administration so mostly my coding is very small and has to run on older Pythons.
