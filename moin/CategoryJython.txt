A category page for content specific to Jython.
We discussed creating this page during a Jython BOF at PyCon 2003.

== Jython Pages ==

 * [[http://www.jython.org/|Official Jython site]]
 * [[Jython]]
 * JythonSuccessStories
 * JythonUses
 * JythonBooks

== Jython Ideas ==

=== Porting Zope ===
At PyCon, there was some talk of porting [[Zope]], or at least the ZODB, to [[Jython]].  Zope Corp. seems interested in this, but they need Jython 2.2.

=== Jython with Eclipse ===
Is it possible to script [[Eclipse]] with [[Jython]]?  If so, could we write a little tutorial?

[[EclipsePythonIntegration]] gives lots of help.

=== Jython success stories ===
We need some. If you know of any large commercial or non-commercial project that has used Jython with success (ideally shipping [[Jython]] code as all or part of a product), please add a note to JythonSuccessStories.  Someone will try to track down more information and interview those involved.

== Jython Problems ==

 * [[Jython]] is currently (mostly) compatible with Python 2.2.
 * In a related point, many people judge "How powerful is Python?" by their first Jython experience.  generators, logging, new-style classes, nested scopes, etc ... do not appear.
 * Jython does not work with [[http://www.kaffe.org/|Kaffe]], which is the only Java implementation that is light enough for the [[http://www.ltsp.org/|Linux Terminal Server Project]] (used in some schools).
