A category page for content specific to Jython.
We discussed creating this page during a Jython BOF at PyCon 2003.

== Jython Pages ==

 * [http://www.jython.org/ Official Jython site]
 * ["Jython"]
 * JythonSuccessStories
 * JythonUses
 * JythonBooks

== Jython Ideas ==

=== Porting Zope ===
At PyCon, there was some talk of porting ["Zope"], or at least the ZODB, to ["Jython"].  Zope Corp. seems interested in this, but they need Jython 2.2.

=== Jython with Eclipse ===
Is it possible to script ["Eclipse"] with ["Jython"]?  If so, could we write a little tutorial?

["EclipsePythonIntegration"] gives lots of help.

=== Jython success stories ===
We need some. If you know of any large commercial or non-commercial project that has used Jython with success (ideally shipping ["Jython"] code as all or part of a product), please add a note to JythonSuccessStories.  Someone will try to track down more information and interview those involved.

== Jython Problems ==

 * ["Jython"] is currently (mostly) compatible with Python 2.1.  There has not been a Jython release that brings Jython up to Python 2.2.  This delay is a problem for several projects (see above).
 * Jython does not work with [http://www.kaffe.org/ Kaffe], which is the only Java implementation that is light enough for the [http://www.ltsp.org/ Linux Terminal Server Project] (used in some schools).
