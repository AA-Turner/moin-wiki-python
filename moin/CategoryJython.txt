A category page for content specific to Jython.

== Jython Pages ==

The definitive documentation for Jython can be found on the [[http://www.jython.org/|official Jython site]].

<<PageList(category:CategoryJython)>>

== Jython Ideas ==

=== Porting Zope ===
At PyCon, there was some talk of porting [[Zope]], or at least the ZODB, to [[Jython]].  Zope Corp. seems interested in this, but they need Jython 2.2.

=== Jython with Eclipse ===
Is it possible to script [[Eclipse]] with [[Jython]]?  If so, could we write a little tutorial?

[[EclipsePythonIntegration]] gives lots of help.

=== Jython Success Stories ===
We need some. If you know of any large commercial or non-commercial project that has used Jython with success (ideally shipping [[Jython]] code as all or part of a product), please add a note to JythonSuccessStories.  Someone will try to track down more information and interview those involved.

== Jython Problems ==

 * Jython does not work with [[http://www.kaffe.org/|Kaffe]], which is the only Java implementation that is light enough for the [[http://www.ltsp.org/|Linux Terminal Server Project]] (used in some schools).

== About this Page ==

We discussed creating this page during a Jython BOF at PyCon 2003.
