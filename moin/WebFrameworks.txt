= Web Frameworks for Python =

A Web framework is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write Web applications or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management. As a developer using a framework, you typically write code which conforms to some kind of conventions, with the benefit being that most of the code can be concerned with the logic of the application, rather than working out how to process incoming network messages, spawn processes, work out which part of the application should be invoked, and so on.

Some frameworks can be considered moderately low-level in that they provide abstractions only for certain things (eg. incoming requests, outgoing responses, state handling), whereas other frameworks provide many more abstractions and mechanisms (eg. database access, presentation of Web pages). Since a non-trivial Web application will require a number of different kinds of abstractions, often stacked upon each other, those frameworks which attempt to provide a complete solution for applications are often known as "full-stack" frameworks in that they attempt to supply components for each layer in the stack.

== Full-Stack Frameworks ==

These frameworks probably cover every area from providing a Web server through database access and persistence to templating and presentation:

 * CherryPy (2.2.0 Released 2006-01-27)CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework
 * ["Cymbeline"] (1.3.1 Released 2005-12-09)application server framework, including functionality such as DB and arbitrary object pooling, web servers, persistant object repository, and a text console
 * ["Django"] (0.95 Released 2006-07-29) Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design
 * ["Karrigell"] (2.3 Released 2006-06-24) designed to be really simple to use : integrated web server and data base
 * [http://plone.org/ Plone] (2.5 Released 2006-06-17) Plone is a Python based popular contet management system running on Zope application server
 * [http://pythonpaste.org/ Python Paste ] (0.4.1 Released 2006-02-18) brings consistency to Python web development and web application installation, providing tools for both developers and system administrators
 * [http://pylonshq.com/ Pylons] (0.9 Released 2006-07-27) Pylons is a lightweight web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid development. It combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl, providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It's also one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, which allows extensive re-use and flexibility but only if you need it. Out of the box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy.
 * SkunkWeb
 * [http://www.turbogears.org/ TurboGears] (0.8.9 Released 2006-01-10) TurboGears is the rapid web development megaframework you've been looking for
 * [http://webpy.org/ web.py] (.137 Released 2006-03-27) Think about the ideal way to write a web app. Write the code to make it happen
 * [http://www.webwareforpython.org/ Webware] (0.9.1 Released 2006-04-23) is a suite of Python packages and tools for developing object-oriented, web-based applications
 * [http://www.zope.org/ Zope] (2.9 Released 2006-01-07) server for building content management systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications

== Lightweight Frameworks ==

Some of these frameworks provide templating but not database access or persistence mechanisms. Others provide only elementary abstractions for things like requests, responses and sessions:

 * ["Albatross"] (1.33 Released 2005-12-16) Albatross is a small and flexible Python toolkit for developing highly stateful web applications.
 * ["Aquarium"] (2.2.1 Released 2005-04-21) offers convenient libraries, tight integration with Cheetah, adaptors for various Web environments
 * [http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow Divmod Nevow] (0.7.0 Released 2005-12-02) A comprehensive library including a resource model encouraging the separation of application and presentation logic, a markup system with support for designer-friendly XHTML templates and pure-Python templates, and a robust AJAX-like API ([http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow/Athena Divmod Athena]) which supports the creation of highly dynamic web pages in a structured manner.
 * ["JonsPythonModules"] (1.06 Released 2004-04-11) is a set of simple yet powerful multi-threaded object-oriented CGI/FastCGI/mod_python/html-templating modules for Python
 * ["JOTWeb2"] (1.10 Released 2005-12-30) developing dynamic web applications using HTML and TAL/TALES/METAL for templating
 * [http://www.myghty.org/ Myghty ] (1.0 Released 2006-01-27) Web application framework originally ported from HTML::Mason
 * [http://nick.borko.org/pse/index.html Python Servlet Engine] (3.0.4 Released 2006-02-17) PSE parses your templates into byte compiled "servlets" to produce web pages that run fast
 * [http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/quixote/ Quixote] (2.4 Released 2005-12-13) to develop dynamic web sites while using as much of their existing Python knowledge as possible
 * [http://snakelets.sourceforge.net/ Snakelets] (1.44 Released 2006-06-04) simple-to-use Python web application server
 * [http://trac.pytan.com/ Spark] Fast and lightweight web kit.  Supports Mod_python, WSGI, Twisted.
 * ["WebStack"] - very lightweight, requiring layers of extra technology to match full-stack frameworks in feature comparisons

== Frameworks in Books ==

These frameworks are not apparently available for download, but are covered in various books:

 * ["Slither"]

== Editorial Note ==

The above lists should be arranged in ascending alphabetical order - please respect this when adding new frameworks. The distinction made between "full-stack" and "lightweight" frameworks is difficult to make - please feel free to relocate frameworks to other lists, but please only do so if you actually know as a user or developer of that framework that the framework is miscategorised. When specifying release dates please use the format YYYY-MM-DD.
