= Web Frameworks for Python =
A Web framework is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write Web applications (see WebApplications) or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

The majority of Web frameworks are exclusively server-side technology, although, with the increased prevalence of AJAX, some Web frameworks are beginning to include AJAX code that helps developers with the particularly tricky task of programming (client-side) the user's browser. At the extreme end of the client-side Web Frameworks is technology that can use the web browser as a full-blown application execution environment (a la gmail for example): see [[WebBrowserProgramming|Web Browser Programming]] for details.

As a developer using a framework, you typically write code which conforms to some kind of conventions that lets you "plug in" to the framework, delegating responsibility for the communications, infrastructure and low-level stuff to the framework while concentrating on the logic of the application in your own code. This "plugging in" aspect of Web development is often seen as being in opposition to the classical distinction between programs and libraries, and the notion of a "mainloop" dispatching events to application code is very similar to that found in [[GuiProgramming|GUI programming]].

Generally, frameworks provide support for a number of activities such as interpreting requests (getting form parameters, handling cookies and sessions), producing responses (presenting data as HTML or in other formats), storing data persistently, and so on. Since a non-trivial Web application will require a number of different kinds of abstractions, often stacked upon each other, those frameworks which attempt to provide a complete solution for applications are often known as '''full-stack''' frameworks in that they attempt to supply components for each layer in the stack.

Many frameworks now provide an element of customization in their support for the above activities and abstractions, utilizing [[WebComponents|components]] in that they provide abstractions only for certain specific things. As a result, it can be possible for you to build your own full-stack framework almost entirely from existing components.

== Popular Full-Stack Frameworks ==
A web application may use a combination of a base HTTP application server, a storage mechanism such as a database, a template engine, a request dispatcher, an authentication module and an AJAX toolkit. These can be individual components or be provided together in a high-level framework.

These are the most popular high-level frameworks. Many of them include components listed on the WebComponents page.

== Books and Articles ==
 * Steve Holden wrote a book on [[http://pydish.holdenweb.com/pwp/|Python Web Programming]]. The book from John Goerzen, [[http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=363|Foundations of Python Network Programming]], can also be useful. O'Reilly's [[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/python3/|Programming Python 3rd Edition]] has 500 pages on Internet programming, including 250 on Web scripting. Finally, check out the Web Programming chapter in [[http://corepython.com|Core Python Programming]] by Wesley Chun -- there is also a small section elsewhere on Web APIs.

 * The [[http://benjiyork.com/quick_start|Zope 3 Quick Start Guide]] gives a short introduction to Zope 3.

== Content Management Systems ==
Content management systems (CMS) often allow you to build application like functionality upon them and typically provide many of the facilities seen in full-stack frameworks. See ContentManagementSystems for more details.

== Web Components ==
Some frameworks promote interoperable components for things like templating/output and authentication/authorization, and so you might see users of different frameworks actually using the same component or library. See WebComponents for details of such components.

== Web Client Frameworks ==
In contrast to server-oriented frameworks which may offer AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) support by serving pre-packaged (inflexible and highly specific but otherwise very useful) JavaScript components, and offering server-side support for requests made by such JavaScript components, Web client frameworks take more direct advantage of the dynamic capabilities of browser engines. Ways in which the full potential of browser engines can be realised are, for example, by compiling Python code into JavaScript or by embedding a Python interpreter into the Web browser itself. In some cases, Web browser engines can be run within separate customised applications rather than in a "web browser" per se. See [[WebBrowserProgramming|Web Browser Programming]] for details.

== Editorial Note ==
The above lists should be arranged in ascending alphabetical order - please respect this when adding new solutions. When specifying release dates please use the format YYYY-MM-DD.

Some special notes to contributors to this page who like to assume an advocacy position when "reorganising" the content:

 * '''Do not''' remove editorial guidelines: when people do this it not only indicates that they do not care about such guidelines, but it also leads others to believe that the page never had any structure or purpose.

 * If you must change the categories used on this page, at least attempt to assign all frameworks to meaningful categories. '''Do not''' invent special categories in order to elevate the profile of certain projects. '''Do not''' merge categories and put frameworks into a miscellaneous category.

 * '''Do not''' add links to projects unless they are Web frameworks. Instead, use the WebComponents, WebServers, [[Templating]] pages, or any page referenced by WebProgramming.

 * Some frameworks are not actively developed or maintained. '''Do not''' just move entries into the "Discontinued/Inactive Frameworks" section without at least doing some investigation first.

And some basic editing advice: use the preview button when making edits, rather than leaving tens of micro-changes in the history.
