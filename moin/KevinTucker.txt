Just starting to look into Python (and Wiki's actually) and I like what I'm seeing and hearing so far!

LionKimbro: Welcome! If you want to play with a wiki of your own, check out [[http://oddwiki.taoriver.net/|OddWiki.]] [[http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki|Meatball]] and [[http://communitywiki.org/|CommunityWiki]] are great places to learn about wiki in general, as well as the venerable Wiki:WardsWiki. As for Python, you are in exactly the right place. :)
