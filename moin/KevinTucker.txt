Just starting to look into Python (and Wiki's actually) and I like what I'm seeing and hearing so far!

LionKimbro: Welcome! If you want to play with a wiki of your own, check out [http://oddwiki.taoriver.net/ OddWiki.] [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki Meatball] and [http://communitywiki.org/ CommunityWiki] are great places to learn about wiki in general, as well as the venerable Wiki:WardsWiki. As for Python, you are in exactly the right place. :)
