I suggest paying for people who can't afford to come, instead of giving out freebies. --itamar

''Thanks for making this suggestion, which has already been talked of as one possibility should the conference be well-enough attended to make it practical. Well, you were asking how you could help. I suppose, should funds be available for this purpose, we'd need someone impartial to make the decisions about who gets paid for. Also remember that ultimately the decision about whether this happens will have to be the PSA's, since it's their money we are talking about. -- steve''

How about a book?  From experience I can honestly say that my best Python books have a tendency to "grow legs", and I've
been known to lend out my Python books to coworkers who are interested in the language.  In fact, for a few of my favorites, 
I've bought multiple copies so I can give one to a workstudy while I have a copy on my desk.  Duplicates of the good ones in
an office around here isn't a bad idea.  -- John
