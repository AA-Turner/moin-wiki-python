= Handling Exceptions =

The simplest way to handle exceptions is with a "try-except" block:

{{{
#!python
(x,y) = (5,0)
try:
  z = x/y
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print "divide by zero"
}}}

If you wanted to examine the exception from code, you could have:

{{{
#!python
(x,y) = (5,0)
try:
  z = x/y
except ZeroDivisionError, e:
  z = e # representation: "<exceptions.ZeroDivisionError instance at 0x817426c>"
print z # output: "integer division or modulo by zero"
}}}

== To Write About... ==

Give example of IOError, and interpreting the IOError code.

Give example of multiple excepts. Handling multiple excepts in one line.

Show how to use "else" and "finally".

Show how to continue with a "raise".
