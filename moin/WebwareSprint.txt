There's no consensus yet on what, precisely, we'll be working on, but I know
I've a personal bias towards MiddleKit enhancements, DAVKit enhancements, and
bringing UserKit out of its alpha-ness.

Feel free to contact me (Tripp Lilley, tripp+pycon-webware-sprint@perspex.com)
directly about the sprint topics, or, better yet, post to webware-devel.

Note that, by design, sprints are "not intended for newbies". That doesn't
mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means that our focus is going to be
on enhancing the code, not teaching the code.

Now, with that said, I'm rusty on the code :) I expect that I'll personally
spend at least some portion of my sprint time fleshing out and diagramming
Webware's architecture, bringing up to date some of the earlier work by
Chuck, Ian, and others.

I expect this exercise would be helpful to those who haven't yet peered deeply
inside Webware's source, but would like to. So, uh, newbies ''are'', in
fact, welcome to this particular sprint :)
