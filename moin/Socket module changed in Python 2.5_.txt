I just upgraded from python 2.4.2 to 2.5 (r25:51908, Jan 4 2007, 17:18:25) and my program using the xmpp module stopped working. Investigating, it appears that ssl() is no longer part of the socket module, but I can't find any documenation to that effect. Here is what I see (opensuse 10.1):

Where did ssl go?

----

Nowhere as far as I know:

{{{

}}}

Maybe you have something missing from your system which is required to build Python with SSL support.

Interesting... any idea what that might be? I grepped all the config* stuff for ssl and there doesn't seem to be any mention of it. Any suggestions on where I start to find out how to build python with ssl support on linux?

----

Ok, I found it. It turns out that setup.py does look for ssl.h in various directories and I didn't have that file. I checked my packages and the openssl-devel package wasn't installed, so I installed that and rebuilt and it works now. I am thinking that there should be some noticable warning when you are missing headers, but at least it works now. Thanks for the reply!
