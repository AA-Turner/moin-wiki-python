Bill Janssen has suggested reviving the Web SIG:
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/meta-sig/2003-September/001277.html

Possible deliverables:

= SSL server support =

Add SSL server-side support to the "socket" module.  This will
include some way of managing certificates.  Probably modelled
strongly after the way we did it in ILU, if [Bill Janssen does] it :-).

http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/ and  http://www.post1.com/home/ngps/m2/ are more complete wrappers.


= HTTP client updates =

Update the "httplib" module to include all of the client-side
functionality available in the Linux "curl" program (a reasonable    checklist, I think, but am open to better suggestions).

Better support for HTTP Digest Authentication.

= HTTP server improvements =

Replace/extend the BaseHTTPServer and SimpleHTTPServer modules with
an extended webserver module which provides at least the
functionality in Medusa.

= cgi module improvements =

The cgi module is really old and has a number of obsolete classes.
It should be cleaned up and modernized.

Anecdote: file upload support in Quixote was unreliable until Greg Ward threw up his hands, ditched cgi.py, and reimplemented file uploads from scratch.  

= Add request/response objects to standard library =

This has been brought up on the [http://www.amk.ca/pipermail/pyweb/ pyweb mailing list].
