This page lists major tasks and goals for enhancing *.python.org infrastructure along with their status. The page should be similar to [[http://dungeonhack.sourceforge.net/Roadmap|this one]] or at least [[http://ufoai.ninex.info/wiki/index.php/TODO/2.3|this one]]. If you have questions about tasks or their status - ask owner or try [[irc://freenode.net/pydotorg|#pydotorg]] IRC channel. If we succeed in organizing our efforts around enhancing *.python.org services, then this page can be extended to cover core Python Development as well.
