The ElementTree library provides an Element type, which is a simple but flexible container object, designed to store hierarchical data structures such as simplified XML infosets.  The library also provides support for reading and writing Element structures as XML.

The Element type is available as a pure-Python implementation for Python 1.5.2 and later.  A high-performance C implementation is also available.

For more information, downloads, and add-ons, see: http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm

There is also an implementation of the ElementTree API on top of libxml2 called lxml. 
It is really fast and has many extensions exposing advanced libxml2/libxslt features:
