The ElementTree library provides an Element type, which is a simple but flexible container object, designed to store hierarchical data structures such as simplified XML infosets.  The library also provides support for reading and writing Element structures as XML.

The Element type is available as a pure-Python implementation for Python 1.5.2 and later.  A high-performance C implementation is also available.
