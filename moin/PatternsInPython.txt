I've removed "Inversion of Control in Python" from the side of DependencyInjectionPattern. "Inversion of Control" is a larger concept than Dependency injection. Dependency injection is a particular mechanism that is frequently used in systems that exhibits IoC type thinking. Even combined with the idea of service location (as opposed to dependency injection,) we still are a smaller idea than "Inversion of Control." [http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#InversionOfControl Martin Fowler himself has said this many times.]

Even "Inversion of Control" may even be poorly named; I would want to call it "Network of Control." But that is neither here nor there, for the purposes of this page.
