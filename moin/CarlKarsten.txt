Ed Leaf 

==============

*New Board Member.*

Ed knows Community, Business and Transparency. 

1. Community

Ed as been an active community member and leader for over 20 years..
Before Python he was well known in the online community Fox Pro support forums.
Later he became the admin of the ProFox mail list.  It is still in use today.
In 2005 he started the Dabo project, an Open Source 3 tier desktop application stack.  He talked about it at many local user groups, both Python and other disciplines, and 3 PyCons.  It is still in use today by more than just me.  (it prints the run sheets I use as part of my video workflow.) 
We may not have always agreed on everything, but you don't stay in in these positions for a decade without doing something right.

2. Business

IBM, working on OpenStack, blogs about it:
https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/openstack-miniconf-at-pycon-au-2013/
RackSpace, maintainer of the PyRax module.
Independent Consultant - over 5 years of using Python for consulting projects.
Microsoft – worked with the community to create MCP tests to evaluate a person's proficiency.

3. Transparency

Dabo-dev is the public mail list of his flagship project's development discussions.  It has had its share of flame wars and other undesirables, but he understands the value of keeping it public.

OpenStack, his current full time job, has a documented transparency policy.
“OpenStack favors disclosure and transparency to promote sharing and collaboration within the OpenStack community.”  - https://www.openstack.org/legal/transparency-policy/
Meetings and discussions are held on public IRC channels, example:
http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-sdks/index.html
Applicants have been disqualified from becoming an OpenStack Partner because their current practices  were not transparent.

James Powell

==============

*New Board Member.*

I work with open source data science tools, with a focus on technologies written in Python and applications of these technologies to problems in quantitative finance.

I am interested in building a richer community surrounding these tools and technologies, and dedicate a significant amount of my time to organising events and groups that support this ecosystem.

I have chaired a number of conferences, including over eight PyData (http://pydata.org) events, one regional Python conference (http://pygotham.org), two finance industry conferences (http://forpythonquants.com), and one data science and machine learning conference (http://opendatascicon.com)

I have also given over 40 talks on advanced Python topics at over 25 conferences in over 8 countries.

Organised and co-ordinated programmes supported by NumFOCUS (http://numfocus.org) including PyData (http://pydata.org), Women in Technology, and the John Hunter Fellowship.

NumFOCUS Vice President
