[Work in progress!]

[insert stub about diversity in python here, and link to diversity statement]

There's a [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/diversity | mailing list]] and [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/diversity/ | archives]], though the latter are only open to subscribers.  It's not hard to subscribe though!

[[http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=263671 | Aahz's blog post]] on why the Diversity list was created, in response to:
[[http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/31/debunking-myths-answering-questions/|Background stats on percentage of women in Open Source]] based on commonly disbelieved stats from Kirrily Robert's [[http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/25/standing-out-in-the-crowd-my-oscon-keynote/|OSCON keynote "Standing Out in the Crowd"]] about women in Open Source.

== Terminology ==

Terms you'll see on this wiki page and in fairly common use on the Diversity mailing list.

"101" - An often used college-level course designator (at least in the US) to indicate that the course is the first in series (Physics 101, Calculus 101, Economics 101, etc.)

[[http://rule6.info/essays/spoons.html|"Spoons"]] - A unit of work/attention/energy which can be allocated for a particular purpose. Often used in the negative "I don't have enough spoons to ..."

== Various Links - not yet classified ==

In the first post to the Diversity mailing list, Steve Holden posted a link to [[http://eaves.ca/2009/07/28/remixing-angie-byron-to-create-the-next-million-mozillians/|Remixing Angie Byron to create the next Million Mozillians]] asking it would apply to the Python community.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design|Universal Design]] and how it can improve design for everyone. Parallels to how diversity can benefit everyone too?

[[http://www.derailingfordummies.com/|Derailing for Dummies]] on the various ways discussions can be derailed, how to spot them, convenient names for talking about them. (Note: "... for Dummies" is a popular series of books (at least in the US) and uses "Dummies" in a some-what self-deprecating way. I've personally often found that the "for Dummies" books are very good introductions. --DougPhilips)

[[http://lca2009.linux.org.au/media/news/66|Google's Diversity Delegates Programme]] - Some of what Google is doing.

[[https://www.tug.org/bursary/|TeX Users Group's Bursary Fund description]] - does not specifically address diversity, just those who might need assistance, but there is probably a correlation.

[[http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/another-post-about-rape-3/|Gender interactions - a continuum where one end leads to rape]] - This is not just a Western issue, cultures around the world are overwhelmingly patriarchal. How we interact in more civilized ways is not irrelevant, but starts the slope ending in this kind of abhorrent behavior. Why the "little stuff" matters. (Link from Steve Holden's message). Aahz then linked to [[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.polyamory/msg/a248e4369d1a2307|this article]] a bit more directly applicable to the topic/Diversty list.

[[http://preview.tinyurl.com/2qh5v6|Article]] explaining the "Why work on X when Y is so much more important" distraction/derailing. Here because this came up in the context of a post suggesting "Open Source is no worse than Closed Source" regarding gender diversity. Those looking to tackle the broader issue of Women and Technology might find [[ http://anitaborg.org/|The Anita Borg Institute]] a helpful resource. ~-(tinyurl preview link since "oh one dot wordpress dot com" links are forbidden here, and this is a link to a Feminism 101 URL on wordpress.)-~

[[http://naramore.net/blog/gender-in-it-oss-php-and-how-it-affects-us-all-1|Women in IT]] - emphasis on PHP, which seems to show better gender balance than Python (as of the Summer of 2009).
