{{{#!wiki note
== Work in Progress! ==
}}}

We welcome you to join our general discussions about diversity in Python:

    * [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/diversity | Diversity -- Promoting diversity in the Python community mailing list]]
        * [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/diversity/ | Diversity archives]] (Only open to subscribers.  It's not hard to subscribe though!)
    * #pydiversity on irc.freenode.net

[[http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=263671 | Aahz's blog post]] on why the Diversity list was created, in response to:
[[http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/31/debunking-myths-answering-questions/|Background stats on percentage of women in Open Source]] based on commonly disbelieved stats from Kirrily Robert's [[http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/25/standing-out-in-the-crowd-my-oscon-keynote/|OSCON keynote "Standing Out in the Crowd"]] about women in Open Source.

= What you can do =

== Simple, personal actions: ==
  * If you attend Python User Group meetings, invite someone from a different background to yourself. Go out of the way to invite young people, women, people from different ethnic backgrounds, people from different cultures, or people from other under-represented groups.
  * If you are in a workplace, try to make sure you are friendly and welcoming to people. Try to be aware of your own cultural biases.
  * Download the diversity presentation [n.b. we are discussing what will be in one] from the DiversityInPython page and present it at your local user group
  * If you are yourself in an underrepresented group, please consider blogging to the [[http://python-open-mike.posterous.com|Open Mike]] in order to increase the visibility of diversity within Python
  * If you are not in an underrepresented group, consider blogging to the open-mike blog with stories about challenges you've faced as a newcomer to a project, conference, or other open-source activity, and how you were able to overcome them. Point out resources that newcomers can use to overcome their own challenges.
  * At the next Python event you are at, make a point to talk to someone diverse or new.
  * Before going to your next Python event, email/call/contact someone diverse from the community and encourage them to meet you there.
  * Encourage diverse non-programmers you know to come to Python for beginners events.
  * Sit down with a diverse non-programmer and teach them the basics of Python.
  * Recommend a diverse Python programmer for a job (even if they already have one).
  * Organize a weekend workshop like the "Boston Python Workshop for women and their friends" in your city.  Feel free to use the documents Jessica !McKellar created for the Boston Python Workshop. General: http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/22818421/. The schedule and links to all documents: http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_3.  Links to all dependencies to be set up on Friday: http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_3/Friday.  You can read her "lessons learned" here: https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/lessons-learned-from-the-boston-python-workshop-an-outreach-event-for-women/
  * Organize an event for women Python developers (or another diversity group) -- could be a cocktail party, a networking event, a barbeque....
  * Run your own meetup event to teach a topic you know, and spread the word to your diverse Python friends to bring a friend (diverse or not -- bringing friends makes everyone feel comfortable).
  * For all future Pycon's, offer to help diverse people with their talk proposal submissions. This would be around Oct-Nov each year so for those few weeks you can help with proof-reading talk submissions, suggest improvements to enhance it from a technical POV.
  * The easiest way to reach out to a diverse community is online. You can offer to conduct a Python course on a mailing list (or a website) for any skillset you wish to pass-on: ranging from, your python packaging skills, to writing a simple web framework in python, writing bioinformatics apps/libraries, a python markdown library, ...basically, just about anything python-related.
  * If you have an existing python app and want contributors, offer to mentor one or two students with getting started with its codebase so they can learn and become contributors over the years.
  * Reach out to diverse delegates from the Welcoming !NotCommittee, which is tasked with organizing a Thursday-evening "welcome to PyCon" event specifically to welcome newcomers and pass on some lore.

== Technical actions: ==
  * Edit the Python.org wiki to include more information in more [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/Languages|languages]]
  * Help create foreign-language versions of the Python documentation [[SourceForge: http://frpython.sourceforge.net|example - French]]
  * Maybe diversity@ or the PSF should look at GSOC projects which support diversity somehow?
  * Add the Python Diversity Statement to the homepage for your local PUG
  * Check the [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonProjects|PythonProjects]] page for projects with special interests that use Python.
  
== Bold action: ==
  * Blog about your own experiences with diversity problems (including your own story if possible).  Better yet, blog about positive diversity experiences and anything you've seen that helped bring more people into the community.
  * Become familiar with the statistics about under-representation of various social groups.  Come-up with ideas about how to help the community better serve their needs.
  * Join [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/diversity | diversity@]] and work with others on whatever needs doing at the time
  * Ask your company to sponsor conference attendance for under-represented groups.  Ideally, this should represent new funding and not a diversion of existing sponsorship money.
  * Next time you feel uncomfortable about what someone is saying, stand up and tell them so.  Remembering that the community (including conference speakers) consists primarily of volunteers, try to provide leadership that encourages people to follow practices that make everyone feel welcome.
  * Buy a diversity@python t-shirt [nb we should design some of these, I'm happy to help]
  

== Broad action: ==
  * Ask your local school if they are have a computing programme / class, and ask if they ever consider diversity issues and whether there is anything you can do to help.
  * Visit your local school and talk about what various groups can expect from Python and the geek community
  * Volunteer to support a local community group's website etc, and use Open Source / Python tools, then tell them about it
  * Become part of a technical mentorship program
  * Try to find tie-in evens between your local PUG and any women's or other diversity technical groups. Have a biannual BBQ get together

== Share your story: ==

Diversity is what happens whenever you have enough people in the same place at the same time, whether you realise it or not. Any group of people, regardless of whatever common features they may share, will nonetheless express enormous diversity in other respects. There is no better way to prove diversity that to show the diverse stories of all of the people who are present. Please share your story by answering one simple question, so that you can help to proudly display the diversity of the Python community.

== Terminology ==

Terms you'll see on this wiki page and in use on the Diversity mailing list.

101 - shorthand for "introduction to the issues that face a certain group".  The term originates in the US practice of designating introductory courses in some_field as "some_field 101".  If the list is discussing an aspect of diversity related to a specific group and you are unfamiliar with the issues involved, it might be a good idea to look at the "101-level" resources below.  If you are unsure where to find information about issues facing a group not listed in the "101" section below, please ask on list and well see what we can find for you.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox|Abilene paradox]] - breakdown in group communication where groups take an action that the all of the group's members oppose.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect|Bystander Effect]] - social psychological phenomenon where individuals in a group do not offer help to people in trouble.

[[http://juliaserano.livejournal.com/14700.html|cis-gender]] - person for whom the sex they were assigned at birth corresponds with their identity.  Used as the opposite of "transgender"

In the first post to the Diversity mailing list, Steve Holden posted a link to [[http://eaves.ca/2009/07/28/remixing-angie-byron-to-create-the-next-million-mozillians/|Remixing Angie Byron to create the next Million Mozillians]] asking it would apply to the Python community.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design|Universal Design]] and how it can improve design for everyone. Parallels to how diversity can benefit everyone too?

[[http://www.derailingfordummies.com/|Derailing for Dummies]] on the various ways discussions can be derailed, how to spot them, convenient names for talking about them. (Note: "... for Dummies" is a popular series of books (at least in the US) and uses "Dummies" in a some-what self-deprecating way. I've personally often found that the "for Dummies" books are very good introductions. --DougPhilips)

[[https://www.tug.org/bursary/|TeX Users Group's Bursary Fund description]] - does not specifically address diversity, just those who might need assistance, but there is probably a correlation.

[[http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/another-post-about-rape-3/|Gender interactions - a continuum where one end leads to rape]] - '''(STRIDENT CONTENT - NOT SAFE FOR WORK)''' - This is not just a Western issue, cultures around the world are overwhelmingly patriarchal. How we interact in more civilized ways is not irrelevant, but starts the slope ending in this kind of abhorrent behavior. Why the "little stuff" matters. (Link from Steve Holden's message). Aahz then linked to [[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.polyamory/msg/a248e4369d1a2307|this article]] a bit more directly applicable to the topic/Diversty list.

[[http://preview.tinyurl.com/2qh5v6|Article]] explaining the "Why work on X when Y is so much more important" distraction/derailing. Here because this came up in the context of a post suggesting "Open Source is no worse than Closed Source" regarding gender diversity.
