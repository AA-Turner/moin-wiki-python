=== Background ===

The second annual [http://www.pycon.org/dc2004 PyCon community conference], ["PyConDC2004"], took place on 24-26 March 2004 at George Washington University's Cafritz Conference Center in Washington, DC. This was a low-cost community-organized conference.  There were four days of sprinting on various projects before the con, from March 20 to March 23; see SprintPlan2004 - as an opportunity to see ExtremeProgramming in action, the PyCon sprint was said to have been a good place to start.
