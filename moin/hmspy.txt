HMSpy

HMSpy is a python-based home media center.

Features;
    DVR
    Podcatcher
    Media Manager
    Bittorrent client
    All of it wraped-up in a cherryPy interface.

I need help with the DVR and Bittorrent functionality. Anyone intrested should e-mail me at Knightowl.joe@gmail.com.

Will update and clean soon.
