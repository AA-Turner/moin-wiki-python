= Python Shells =

The term "Python shell" has a certain amount of ambiguity: for some people it may merely refer to an interactive Python environment with special capabilities (autocompletion, visualisation, and so on); for others it may refer to a replacement command environment for traditional UNIX shells (sh, csh, bash, etc.) where emphasis is placed on interaction with files and programs.

== Traditional Shell Replacements ==

See the UsePythonAsAnInteractiveShell page for a discussion on using Python command environments as UNIX shell replacements.

Editorial note: the following projects are currently missing Web links...

 * PyroShell (a combination of Pyro and PyShell allows user to have an interactive autocomplete interpreter on a remote machine)
 * CherryShell (a Python shell in a Web browser; currently version 0.1 but still useful for remote operations; designed to replace PyroShell, feature code completion and code tips; works right now only with Firefox)
