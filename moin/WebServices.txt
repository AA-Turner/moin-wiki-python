= Web Services =

Web services can be generally regarded as functions or functionality of applications or systems exposed over the Web using standardised message formats and typically interfaced to other software using traditional APIs, although "message-centric" usage of such services is also possible and may be favoured by certain technologies.

== SOAP ==

["SOAP"] is a Web services technology favoured in certain environments. The following projects seek to support SOAP and related technologies such as WSDL:

 * [http://www.python.org/pypi/soaplib soaplib] - a more recently established Web services library
 * [http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/soappy.txt SOAPpy] - part of the actively maintained [http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/ Python Web Services] project
 * [http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html ZSI] (Zolera Soap Infrastructure) - a version of the actively maintained [http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/ Python Web Services] project

== XML-RPC ==

The first popular and largely standardised Web services technology was [wiki:XmlRpc XML-RPC], supported in Python by the following libraries:

 * xmlrpclib - found in the standard library

== XMPP ==

More in common with the message-centric usage of ["SOAP"], [http://www.xmpp.org/ XMPP] - an Internet standard which provides the foundation for the Jabber instant messaging technology - could be used as a Web services protocol. See ["PythonXml"] for details of suitable projects.

== Editorial Note ==

The above lists should be arranged in ascending alphabetical order - please respect this when adding new solutions. When specifying release dates please use the format YYYY-MM-DD.
