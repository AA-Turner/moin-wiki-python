This approach allows a project to write functional specifications using simple grammar and somewhat natural English statements, tests for which can be automated and run nightly or on-demand in the development cycle.

   * no laptop or additional computer needed to run full Python scripts on the ASE

 * We had 3 Android phones (incl. the new Droid), and played with sensors & httpd.  We added a simple hack to allow connecting ASE over wifi, without USB cables.  This will allow future attendees to run Python on an Android device from their laptops, without needing to bring their own Android device (esp. if they don't have one).
