 * Dove into Python on Android with the [[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/|Android Scripting Environment]] (ASE).
 * We had 3 Android phones (incl. the new Droid), and played with sensors & httpd.  We added a simple hack to allow connecting ASE over wifi, without USB cables.  This will allow future attendees to run Python on an Android device from their laptops, without needing to bring their own Android device (esp. if they don't have one).
