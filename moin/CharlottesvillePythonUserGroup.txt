 * 26 attendees (20 !AgileCville, 6 PyCHO)
 * !OpenSpace, 455 Second Street SE, Suite 100 Charlottesville, VA 22902 ([[http://getopenspace.com/|info]])

== Tuesday, Feb 16, 2010 ==
 * 3 attendees
 * !OpenSpace, 455 Second Street SE, Suite 100 Charlottesville, VA 22902 ([[http://getopenspace.com/|info]])
 * investigated Python in a [[http://www.debian.org/|Debian]] environment running on an [[http://android.com|Android]] G1 - Android and Debian running on the same device without interfering with each other ([[http://www.saurik.com/id/10|setup instructions here]])
  * discussed experience with running Python on embedded devices - not as slow as some might think
  * Debian on Android gives a full Python installation with entire standard library
   * can connect to [[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/|Android Scripting Environment]] (ASE) by RPC to access Android API from the Debian side
   * no laptop or additional computer needed to run full Python scripts on the ASE
  * virtualenv and extension modules work fine on debian+Android
  * installed [[http://supervisord.org/|supervisor]] on Android via Debian; can easily launch any linux-based background application on Android using supervisor!

== Tuesday, Jan 19, 2010 ==
 * 3 attendees
 * !OpenSpace, 455 Second Street SE, Suite 100 Charlottesville, VA 22902 ([[http://getopenspace.com/|info]])
 * A look at [[http://pyjs.org/|pyjamas]]
 * discussed new hack night format

== Tuesday, Dec 15, 2009 ==
 * 5 attendees
 * !OpenSpace, 455 Second Street SE, Suite 100 Charlottesville, VA 22902 ([[http://getopenspace.com/|info]])
 * More Python on Android with the [[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/|Android Scripting Environment]] (ASE).

== Tuesday, Nov 17, 2009 ==
 * 5 attendees
 * !OpenSpace, 455 Second Street SE, Suite 100 Charlottesville, VA 22902 ([[http://getopenspace.com/|info]])
 * Dove into Python on Android with the [[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/|Android Scripting Environment]] (ASE).
 * We had 3 Android phones (incl. the new Droid), and played with sensors & httpd.  We added a simple hack to allow connecting ASE over wifi, without USB cables.  This will allow future attendees to run Python on an Android device from their laptops, without needing to bring their own Android device (esp. if they don't have one).
