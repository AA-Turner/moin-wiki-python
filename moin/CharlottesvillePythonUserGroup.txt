<<TableOfContents(1)>>

= Developers =
Join the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva|centralva@python.org]] mailing list, introduce yourself, ask questions, share your interests, and propose a meetup.

PyCHO had a regular monthly meetup April 2009 to November 2011 (2.5 years), and then had a period of dormancy, '''but as of October 2013, it is revived and will resume regular meetings'''! See the mailing list and promote meetup ideas.

= Recruiters =
If you're a recruiter looking for Python developers, you are one of many.  You are welcome to send mail to Python developers in Central VA at centralva@python.org , a private moderated list.  However, note that you'll have better success meeting and networking with Python developers than simply blasting out a job posting.

If you are a Python developer looking for a job, see the list archives for postings and get in touch with PyCHO members through the mailing list (or try contacting the organizer).

= Discussion and Questions =
 * mailing list: [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva|centralva@python.org]] (subscribe [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centralva|here]])
 * mailing list archives are available to subscribers [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/centralva/|here]]
 * PyCHO was created by [[mailto:ron.duplain@gmail.com|Ron DuPlain]]. As of October 2013, the group is now being run by [[mailto:ajm@pixelmonkey.org|Andrew Montalenti]]. Feel free to email him with questions or ideas about the local Python user group.  Try the mailing list first.  For questions on Python (and you're local), use the mailing list.

  * Debian on Android gives a full Python installation with entire standard library
   * can connect to [[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/|Android Scripting Environment]] (ASE) by RPC to access Android API from the Debian side
   * no laptop or additional computer needed to run full Python scripts on the ASE
  * virtualenv and extension modules work fine on debian+Android

 * We had 3 Android phones (incl. the new Droid), and played with sensors & httpd.  We added a simple hack to allow connecting ASE over wifi, without USB cables.  This will allow future attendees to run Python on an Android device from their laptops, without needing to bring their own Android device (esp. if they don't have one).
