= FRUncon 09: Front Range Pythoneers Unconference 2009 =

We're planning a Python Unconference.  Date: October 10, 2009, all day Saturday.  Location and cost TBD.

To learn more about unconferences, click [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference|here]].

Note that an unconference assumes participation by a majority of the attendees.  The more you put into it, the more you'll get out.  
Please feel free to edit this page if you'd like to contribute.

== Location ==

Still working on this.  We have had suggestions to use CU, UCD, or the Anschutz campus.  If you have contacts at these locations, and are willing to help check into cost and availability, please make a note of it here.  The ideal location would have a conference room that can seat 50 or so people, with adjacent smaller rooms that can be used for breakout sessions.

== Sponsorship ==

If we can find some sponsors, either corporate or nonprofit, we can keep the cost down and get the companies more involved.  If you know somebody that might be willing to be a sponsor, check with them, and make a note here if they're willing to help out.
