= FRUncon 09: Front Range Pythoneers Unconference 2009 =

We're planning a Python Unconference.  Date: October 10, 2009, all day Saturday.   We will be following up with code sprints on Sunday the 11th.

Note that an unconference assumes participation by a majority of the attendees.  The more you put into it, the more you'll get out.  
Please feel free to edit this page if you'd like to contribute.
