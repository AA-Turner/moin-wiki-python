= Escaping HTML =

The {{{cgi}}} module that comes with Python has an {{{escape()}}} function:

{{{
#!python
import cgi

s = cgi.escape( """& < >""" )   # s = "&amp; &lt; &gt;"
}}}

However, it doesn't escape characters beyond {{{&}}}, {{{<}}}, and {{{>}}}.

Here's a small snippet that will let you escape those as well:

{{{
#!python
html_escape_table = {
    "&": "&amp;",
    '"': "&quot;",
    "'": "&apos;",
    ">": "&gt;",
    "<": "&lt;",
    }

def html_escape(text):
    """Produce entities within text."""
    L=[]
    for c in text:
        L.append(html_escape_table.get(c,c))
    return "".join(L)
}}}

== Unescaping HTML ==

Undoing the escaping performed by {{{cgi.escape()}}} isn't directly supported by the library.  This can
be accomplished using a fairly simple function, however:

{{{
#!python
def unescape(s):
    s = s.replace("&lt;", "<")
    s = s.replace("&gt;", ">")
    # this has to be last:
    s = s.replace("&amp;", "&")
    return s
}}}

Note that this will undo exactly what {{{cgi.escape()}}} does; it's easy to extend this to undo what
the {{{html_escape()}}} function above does.  Note the comment that converting the {{{&amp;}}} must be last;
this avoids getting strings like {{{"&amp;lt;"}}} wrong.

This approach is simple and fairly efficient, but is limited to supporting the entities given in the list.
A more thorough approach would be to perform the same processing as an HTML parser.  Using the HTML parser from the standard library is a little more expensive, but many more entity replacements are supported
"out of the box."  The table of entities which are supported can be found in the {{{htmlentitydefs}}}
module from the library; this is not normally used directly, but the {{{htmllib}}} module uses it to
support most common entities.  It can be used very easily:

{{{
#!python
import htmllib

def unescape(s):
    p = htmllib.HTMLParser(None)
    p.save_bgn()
    p.feed(s)
    return p.save_end()
}}}

This version has the additional advantage that it supports character references (things like {{{&#65;}}})
as well as entity references.

A more efficient implementation would simply parse the string for entity and character references directly
(and would be a good candidate for the library, if there's really a need for it outside of HTML data).

== Discussion ==

LionKimbro: Is there anything in the standard library for going the other way? Is there something where you can give it "&amp;" and get back "&"? Perhaps in the XML libraries? I looked, but did not see anything. DOM, SAX- wouldn't be there. Not exactly XML-RPC either.  Anyone know?  (Answer needed for XML.)  [[Date(2005-06-10T16:35:16Z)]]

FredDrake:  Well, the HTML answer is easy.  :-)  The XML isn't hard, but there's certainly more overhead in
making it more than a trivial replacement for a handful of entity references (at least if we involve SAX).
I'll write up how to do this efficiently for XML after I put the kids to bed.
