= Escaping HTML =

The {{{cgi}}} module that comes with Python has an {{{escape}}} function:

{{{
#!python
import cgi

s = cgi.escape( """& < >""" )   # s = "&amp; &lt; &gt;"
}}}

However, it doesn't escape anything beyond {{{&}}}, {{{<}}}, and {{{>}}}.

Here's a small snippet that will let you escape those as well:

{{{
#!python
html_escape_table = {
    "&": "&amp;",
    '"': "&quot;",
    "'": "&apos;",
    ">": "&gt;",
    "<": "&lt;" }

def html_escape( text ):
    l=[]
    for c in text:
        l.append( html_escape_table.get(c,c) )
    return "".join(l)
}}}
