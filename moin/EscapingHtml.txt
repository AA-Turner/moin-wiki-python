= Escaping HTML =


The {{{cgi}}} module that comes with Python has an {{{escape()}}} function:



{{{#!python
import cgi

s = cgi.escape( """& < >""" )   # s = "&amp; &lt; &gt;"
}}}



However, it doesn't escape characters beyond {{{&}}}, {{{<}}}, and {{{>}}}. If it is used as {{{cgi.escape(string_to_escape, quote=True)}}}, it also escapes {{{"}}}.


Recent Python 3.2 have [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html| html module]] with {{{html.escape()}}} and {{{html.unescape()}}} functions. {{{html.escape()}}} differs from {{{cgi.escape()}}} by its defaults to {{{quote=True}}}:



{{{#!python
import html

s = html.escape( """& < " ' >""" )   # s = '&amp; &lt; &quot; &#x27; &gt;'
}}}



Here's a small snippet that will let you escape quotes and apostrophes as well:

{{{#!python
html_escape_table = {
    "&": "&amp;",
    '"': "&quot;",
    "'": "&apos;",
    ">": "&gt;",
    "<": "&lt;",
    }

def html_escape(text):
    """Produce entities within text."""
    return "".join(html_escape_table.get(c,c) for c in text)
}}}



You can also use {{{escape()}}} from {{{xml.sax.saxutils}}} to escape html. This function should execute faster. The {{{unescape()}}} function of the same module can be passed the same arguments to decode a string.




{{{#!python
from xml.sax.saxutils import escape, unescape
# escape() and unescape() takes care of &, < and >.
html_escape_table = {
    '"': "&quot;",
    "'": "&apos;"
}
html_unescape_table = {v:k for k, v in html_escape_table.items()}

def html_escape(text):
    return escape(text, html_escape_table)

def html_unescape(text):
    return unescape(text, html_unescape_table)
}}}



== Unescaping HTML ==


Undoing the escaping performed by {{{cgi.escape()}}} isn't directly supported by the library. This can be accomplished using a fairly simple function, however:







{{{#!python
def unescape(s):
    s = s.replace("&lt;", "<")
    s = s.replace("&gt;", ">")
    # this has to be last:
    s = s.replace("&amp;", "&")
    return s
}}}



or alternatively (before [[http://bugs.python.org/issue2927|issue2927]]):





{{{
>>> from HTMLParser import HTMLParser
>>> HTMLParser.unescape.__func__(HTMLParser, 'ss&copy;')
u'ss\xa9'
}}}


Note that this will undo exactly what {{{cgi.escape()}}} does; it's easy to extend this to undo what the {{{html_escape()}}} function above does. Note the comment that converting the {{{&amp;}}} must be last; this avoids getting strings like {{{"&amp;lt;"}}} wrong.


This approach is simple and fairly efficient, but is limited to supporting the entities given in the list. A more thorough approach would be to perform the same processing as an HTML parser. Using the HTML parser from the standard library is a little more expensive, but many more entity replacements are supported "out of the box." The table of entities which are supported can be found in the {{{htmlentitydefs}}} module from the library; this is not normally used directly, but the {{{htmllib}}} module uses it to support most common entities. It can be used very easily:







{{{#!python
import htmllib

def unescape(s):
    p = htmllib.HTMLParser(None)
    p.save_bgn()
    p.feed(s)
    return p.save_end()
}}}



This version has the additional advantage that it supports character references (things like {{{&#65;}}}) as well as entity references.


A more efficient implementation would simply parse the string for entity and character references directly (and would be a good candidate for the library, if there's really a need for it outside of HTML data).


== Formal htmlentitydefs ==


Yet another approach available with recent Python takes advantage of htmlentitydefs:


{{{
import re
from htmlentitydefs import name2codepoint
def htmlentitydecode(s):
    return re.sub('&(%s);' % '|'.join(name2codepoint),
            lambda m: unichr(name2codepoint[m.group(1)]), s)
}}}


== Builtin HTML/XML escaping via ASCII encoding ==


A very easy way to transform non-ASCII characters like German umlauts or letters with accents into their HTML equivalents is simply encoding them from unicode to ASCII and use the {{{xmlcharrefreplace}}} encoding error handling:


{{{
>>> a = u"äöüßáà"
>>> a.encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace')
'&#228;&#246;&#252;&#223;&#225;&#224;'
}}}


Note, that this does only transform ''non''-ASCII characters and therefore leaves {{{<}}}, {{{>}}}, {{{?}}} as they are. However, you can combine this technique with the {{{cgi.escape}}}.

XML entities are different from, if related to, HTML entities. This page hints at the details:
