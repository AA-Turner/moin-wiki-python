Collects requirements for the conference software.

== Features ==

 * Registration for the conference
 * Scheduling
 * Mapping of attendee locations
 * Paper submissions
 * Conference feedback

== Users ==

 * At a minimum, we must have a user's e-mail address so that we can contact them.
 * Users can have multiple flags set: speaker, volunteer, session chair.  (More such flags may be added.)
 * Users can optionally supply their geographic location for mapping, paper mailings, and for inclusion on the badges.
 * Attendee e-mail addresses can be exported in order to add them to a conference mailing list.

== Paper submission ==

 * Users can submit proposals.
 * Some users have 'reviewer' status and can look at other people's proposals.
 * Some users have 'organizer' status and can mark proposals as 'accepted' or 'declined', and can set a scheduled time/location.
 * Proposals have: title, summary/abstract, description, category, length (30/45 min), difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced), a list of 3 assigned reviewers, an accepted boolean, a list of reviewer comments, and a list of uploaded documents.
 * On being submitted, proposals are assigned 3 reviewers at random.  If the author has reviewer status, the author must not be one of the assigned reviewers.
 * Reviewers can vote +1, -1, +0, -0, or 'no vote' on proposals, with a mandatory comment.  These comments are not shown to authors until after the selection process is complete.
 * Reports: all proposals,  all proposals with fewer than 3 votes, all proposals with 3 or more votes grouped by their votes (all positive, all negative, a mixture).
 * Reviewers can enter comments that will be e-mailed to the author.  Authors can add replies to these comments.
 * One-time operation: Authors can be e-mailed the review comments written about their reports.
 * One-time operation: Authors are e-mailed the accept/decline decision about their proposal.

== Registration ==

 * Must able to produce a list of attendees, showing attendee name, T-shirt size, food preferences if any, include in delegate listing Y/N, permission to e-mail about PyCon Y/N, paid/unpaid Y/N, certain special flags (e.g. speaker/session/chair) so we can hand them the right swag bag and info.
 * Can charge the user's credit card for the appropriate amount.  Or attendees can be marked as 'unpaid', and they must then mail a cheque to the PSF.
 * Must support different prices for students and non-students. 
 * Keeps or can generate the total revenue for the conference.
 * Badge information must be exportable (or maybe we can produce PDF for printing).
 * Badges must show: user's name, certain flags (speaker, session chair, volunteer).
 * Badges can optionally show the attendee's organization and home location, at the attendee's choice.
 * Attendees can register for the conference and optionally for tutorials.
 * The software should track the number of attendees for each tutorial, closing registration once the tutorial has filled up.
    * Tutorial money may need to be refunded if a tutorial is cancelled.
    * Tutorial may need to be switched to another if cancelled?
    * Maybe they specify 1, 2, ... preference for am and pm, and we refund only when no preferred tutorial is available? * Multiple attendees can be registered in one operation and charged to the same credit card.  A maximum of 3 attendees is sufficient.
 * Registrants can optionally donate an amount to the PSF.
 * Admin: add a registrant without charging a credit card.  (We still need to count free attendees for T-shirt counts, hotel bookings, etc.)
 * Reports: list of all publicly visible registrants, list of all registrants (admin only), list of unregistered speakers.
 * Export presentation materials into a directory tree that can be turned into the conference proceedings.

== Mapping ==

 * google maps integrated
 * supports foreign countries
 * comment and interest tags per entry
 * map 'pin' locations sent via compliant XML (to work with other google stuff)
 * multiple types of 'pins' (different colors, shapes):
    * Person
    * Sponser of PyCon
    * Corporation (employer of engineers with python experience)
    * Python Users Group
    * Zoom Group (see next bullet)
 * When soomed out merge multiple overlapping pins into one Zoom Group 'pin'
 * support search and filter of pins by interest tag and pin type


== Scheduling ==

 * Produce printable schedules for the entire conference, and for individual rooms for a given day.
 * Track session chairs for each session.

== Sponsors ==

 * Sponsors can fill in a form with contact information that gets stored in a list and also e-mailed to the sponsorship coordinator.
 * (Admin) The coordinator can enter sponsors who've committed: contact info, sponsorship level (platinum/gold/silver), paid Y/N, banner provided Y/N, banner received Y/N, comments on where the banner should be displayed.
