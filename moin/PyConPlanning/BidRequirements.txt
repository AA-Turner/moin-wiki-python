Venue Requirements for PyCon
============================

Please send comments/questions/suggestions to the 
<pycon-organizers at python.org> mailing list.

PyCon is an inexpensive, community-oriented conference for users and
developers of the Python programming language, organized by the Python
Software Foundation and a group of volunteers.

Traditionally the structure of PyCon has been three days of presentations, 
and two or four days of sprints.  PyCon 2006 adds a tutorial day.

This is a list of the general requirements for a venue.  The critical
things you need for PyCon are 1) a place to talk 2) equipment to talk
with 3) an Internet connection, 4) optionally, food.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to propose to
host PyCon, write to the organizers' mailing list at <pycon-organizers
at python.org>.  You may want to assemble a set of wiki pages
containing the information below.

Facilities 
----------

**Auditorium**: A large lecture-hall style room that can hold all
the conference attendees at one time (for keynotes).

**Meeting rooms**: Three rooms with a total capacity approximately
equal to that of the full assembly.  One of these rooms may be the
auditorium.

**Common area**: A common area in which groups of attendees can
informally meet and where conference registration can take place.
Requires a number (4 or so) tables for registration.

**Sprint rooms**: two or more rooms for sprints.  These rooms are
usually re-used during the conference for open space talks.
Multiple sprints can run at the same time, so these rooms should
contain a number of tables that can seat ~10 people with their
laptops.

**Quiet room**: A room for people to use their laptops in silence.
This room should be able to seat 30-50 people at tables, and have an
Internet connection.

**Storage**: A secure room in which to store supplies, including
materials for all the attendees and all necessary equipment.

All facilities should be accessible by disabled persons, and held
in controlled temperature environments (air-conditioned or heated
as needed).  

The location should be accessible by public transport.  It's a bonus
if there are interesting attractions nearby (museums, attractions,
etc.).

When would the conference be scheduled? e.g. the time of year; on the
weekend or during the week; how late the venue can stay open.




Catering (optional)
------------------------

Breakfast, snacks, and a light lunch for three days.  Some attendees
will be vegetarian/vegan; some may require lactose-free or
low-carbohydrate meals.  While not all meals may be provided, the
resources must be available.  (Snacks are less important than lunch;
if no meals are provided at all, the resulting registration cost
should reflect this.)

If food will not be provided, there should be restaurants
or other places for lunch within walking distance.  
There should be enough of these to handle the conferance
attendance (if there's one small restaurant within walking distance,
it'll get swamped).

Accommodation
----------------

Nearby commercial hotels, restaurants, and social venues must be
available.  

If the facility is a hotel: how many rooms does it have?  What would
the room rate be?

If the facility does not offer accommodation, some nearby
inexpensive accommodations, such as hostels, should be
identified. 


A/V Equipment
-------------------

**Auditorium and Meeting Rooms**: Public address system, data
projectors, transparency (overhead) projectors, and both wired and
wireless Ethernet.  Preferably wireless microphones as well
as podium mics.


Transportation
-------------------

Nearby access to an airport, preferably a large one.  

Parking facilities or arrangements, as appropriate.  

How to arrive by public transport and taxi from the airport, or other major points.


Finances
------------

Rough cost information for all the above so that we can estimate the
required registration price.  The PSF doesn't need to make an enormous
profit, and can tolerate a small loss, but it's obviously better if
the conference can be slightly profitable.

The acceptable upper bound on the early-bird registration cost is
$200; as a first approximation you can assume that **everyone**
registers at the early-bird rate.
