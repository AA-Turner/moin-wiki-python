==========
Background
==========

PyCon is an inexpensive, community-oriented conference for users and developers of the Python programming language, organized by the Python Software Foundation and a group of volunteers. PyCon 2007 had almost 600 people, and PyCon 2008 has more than 900 registrations.

PyCon is a North American conference; we don't intend to move into territory served by EuroPython or Python UK. So far, all PyCons have been in the US, but we're open to considering locations in Canada and Mexico.

The structure of recent PyCons has been three days of presentations, followed
by two to four days of sprints. PyCon 2006 added a pre-conference tutorial day that was a great success and it has since become a standard part of the PyCon experience.  PyCon 2009 will see two days of tutorials.

Scheduling: PyCon should be held between mid-February and mid-April.  We have to avoid conflicting with Easter and other holidays.

In the past, the location for PyCon was chosen through a grass-roots bid process.  Local groups with a passion for bringing PyCon to their area got together and solicited bids from local hotels and other venues.  That process embodied the community spirit that drives not only PyCon but also the whole of the Python language.  

Year after year, PyCon has seen impressive attendance growth and continued enthusiasm from the community, bringing attendees from far and wide.  The growth has been exciting, but it has put PyCon into a class of conferences that not every venue can handle.  But PyCon is now a class of conference that many venues will compete for.

A New Bid Process
=================

As PyCon has grown, the demands made by the traditional bid process have grown as well -- there are larger requirements with a smaller selection of venues available to suit our needs.  Moreover, those extra challenges were faced not just by one group, but by all the local groups who were interested in hosting PyCon.  There was a massive duplication of effort across all of the bidding groups.  Many of the local groups have little to no experience with selecting venues and negotiating contracts for large venues.  It has become clear that the old bid process would quickly limit PyCon, either through escalating costs due to inexperienced negotiation, or worse, through a process of overwhelming our wonderful local volunteers with a complex and demanding process.

Beginning with the 2008 bid from the Chicago group, PyCon has begun working with a professional meeting management group in order to help select venues and negotiate contracts.  This allows precious volunteer energy to be re-focused on the important things: making PyCon the experience we all want it to be.  Therefore, the requirements for future PyCon bids will be different than years past in that we won't be asking local groups to actually begin negotiations with venues.

Instead, we're looking for a somewhat less formal proposal telling us why PyCon should be held in your local area.  Interested?  Here's what you should do:

- If you're attending PyCon 2008, join us for a kick-off meeting over lunch on Saturday, March 15th.

- Form a group of people interested in helping with the conference planning.

- Make sure at least one person from your group is on the `PyCon organizer's list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers>`__, and, as soon as possible, announce your interest in submitting a bid on the list.  This process should be viewed as cooperative -- we're here to help and encourage any group that wants to take on hosting PyCon.

- Next, assemble your official bid, following the guidelines below, and submit it to the `PyCon organizer's list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers>`__ by the deadline listed below. (Publicly viewable wikis are highly encouraged)

Bid Requirements:
-----------------

- Tell us, briefly, what's good and what's great about the city/region/state that would make it a good place to host PyCon.  Tell us the pros and cons about the local area:

  - Are major venues (1500+ person capacity) plentiful or at least available?

  - Are they clustered or located in any particular area(s)?

  - Transportation resources:

    - How close is the nearest major airport to the heart of the city or region?

    - What sort of transportation options are available?  Bus, taxi, train, light-rail, subway, etc.  How much does a trip on each cost?

    - How close are these resources to the large venues you identified above?

  - What other major (1000+ attendee) events has your area hosted recently?           

    - Any tech-related events?

  - How's the weather?  Remember, the target is for PyCon to be held between mid-February and mid-April.

  - What (besides PyCon) would be a big attraction for someone visiting the area?  

- Tell us about your group:

  - Who are you?  

  - What's your connection to Python and the larger Python Community?

  - How many volunteers can you expect to provide for PyCon?  Remember, this is planning for two years in advance.

  - Looking at the `PyCon staff roles list <http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/staff/>`__, are there any local people who would be committed to filling a particualr role?

  - Are there any key players who bring experience or skills that you feel are particularly valuable to PyCon?

    - Have any of you organized any large events similar to PyCon? If so, tell us about it!


    
- Tell us about the local Python community:

  - Users group(s) for Python? Django? Zope? Plone? Any local university Python groups? 

  - Local companies doing exciting things with Python?

    - Would they be interested in sponsoring PyCon?

- Tell us about the local tech community:

  - Who are the big IT and Tech related companies in the area?

    - Do they use Python?

- Beyond what's been covered above, is there anything else you feel is important for us to keep in mind as we consider your bid to host PyCon? 
     
======================
A New Decision Process
======================

The bid submission is just the beginning!

We hope to receive proposals from multiple groups/regions.  The site-selection committee will work with the groups making bids and the professional meeting planner in order to identify one or two target cities or regions.  From there, the site-selection committee along with the professional meeting planner will put out a Request For Proposal (RFP) to the local hotels and convention venues.  Once target venues have been identified, the local bid groups will have a chance to give their input and review of the prospective venues.  

The PSF Board of Directors will make the final decision.
The site-selection committee will make a recommendation based on the
responses we get back from the RFP process and the local groups.  The PyCon
Chair will then present that recommendation to the PSF Board for
approval.
