Bids: PyCon2008_


Background
==============

PyCon is an inexpensive, community-oriented conference for users and
developers of the Python programming language, organized by the Python
Software Foundation and a group of volunteers.  Recent PyCons have had
attendances of around 425 people.

PyCon is a North American conference; we don't intend to move into
territory served by EuroPython or Python UK.  So far all PyCons have
been in the US, but we're open to considering locations in Canada and
Mexico.

Traditionally the structure of PyCon has been three days of
presentations, and two to four days of sprints. PyCon 2006 added a pre-conference tutorial day that was a great success, so you should also assume a day of tutorials.

This is a list of the general and venue requirements, and
miscellaneous notes.  The critical things you need for PyCon are 1) a
place to talk 2) equipment to talk with 3) an Internet connection, 4)
optionally, food.  Your proposed venue doesn't have to meet every
single requirement, but you should be able to explain why the missing
requirements won't be a problem.

We are open to multi-year bids, but you're certainly not forced to
assume hosting the conference for two or more years.  Multi-year contracts with hotels or conference centers can strengthen your negotiating position with the hotel and let you lower costs by extracting concessions.  On the other hand, if there are problems with the hotel at the first conference, you're committed to using the location again and you don't have much negotiating leverage at that point.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to propose to
host PyCon, write to the organizers' mailing list at <pycon-organizers
at python.org>.  You may want to assemble a set of web or wiki pages
containing the information below.


Decision Process & Timeline
===========================

Bids should be prepared in time for PyCon 2007.  Ideally we'd like to
make a decision for 2008 by or at PyCon 2007.  If we have one or more
bids by PyCon, we can decide there, and we can sign contracts soon
thereafter.

The `Conference Committee`_ will make a recommendation on the bids to
the PSF Board of Directors, who will make the final decision.

General Requirements
====================

Conference Scheduling
---------------------

Ideally PyCon would be held between mid-February and mid-April.  The
first three PyCons were held in Washington DC in late March; 2006/2007
were held from late February to early March.  We have to watch out for
Easter though; one PyCon ended up conflicting.

PyCon has traditionally been in the late winter / early spring,
EuroPython takes place in early July, OSCON is in late July, and SciPy
is in August/September.  We don't want the main Python events to be
too close together.  But we are flexible, and anything is possible.

In 2006 & 2007, the main conference was held over a weekend
(Friday-Sunday), with a tutorial day the Thursday before and 4 sprint
days after (Monday-Thursday).  Previously, the main conference was on
weekdays (Wednesday-Friday), with 2 or 4 days of sprints before.
Weekend or weekdays, both patterns worked.

Sprints *after* the conference seemed to work out better though, as
they start off with the most people and taper off, and it is worth noting that post-conference sprints allow for organization/evangelism during the conference.  Tutorials before the conference make sense, but could also be held on the day after the main conference in parallel with sprints.


Finances
------------

The PSF doesn't need to make an enormous profit, and can tolerate a
small loss, but it's obviously better if the conference can be
slightly profitable.

The acceptable upper bound on the early-bird registration cost is
$250, although we'd like to keep it closer to (or below) $200.  As a
first approximation you can assume that **everyone** registers at the
early-bird rate.

The PSF will sign the contracts and pay the bills.  This means the PSF is legally liable and no insurance need be provided by the local organizers.


Hotel or Conference Hall?
-------------------------

Holding PyCon at a hotel with sufficient conference space is
convenient: for most attendees, the weather won't be a factor, and
there's no commute.  A conference hall can work too; the first three
PyCons were held at a university's conference center.


Hotel Room Rates
----------------

If the conference is held at a hotel, we will be expected to fill a
bank of rooms (see `Room-Night Obligation`_ below).  The room rate
should be as low as possible.  In 2006/2007, the conference hotel room
rate was $79 (+ tax == $90) for a single/double-occupancy room, which
was quite reasonable.  If the room rate is much higher, many people
will be forced to look for cheaper accommodations elsewhere, and this
may hurt the conference itself.

If the conference does not take place at a hotel, there should be a
range of accommodations nearby or accessible by public transit.
Special attention should be paid to the low end: inexpensive hotels,
motels, and hostels.


Room-Night Obligation
---------------------

A hotel with conference space may offer the space for free or at a
reduced rate, with the understanding that the conference attendees
will stay at that hotel.  The conference will be asked to guarantee a
certain number of room-nights.  For PyCon 2006 & 2007, we contracted
for 80% of 870 room-nights (696 room-nights).  We totalled 955
room-nights in 2006 and 2007 will be well over our obligation.  The
distribution was approximately:

* 80 room-nights for the night before the tutorial day,
* 200 room-nights for each of the nights *before* the three conference
  days,
* 100 room-nights for the night of the last conference day,
* 50, 40, 30, and 10 room-nights for the following nights.

There were a few rooms booked before and after these days.  The
2006/2007 contract applied the conference rate up to 3 days before and
after the event.  The contract should apply the reduced room rate to
all nights.

The contract stated that *if* the hotel had *any* available rooms,
even after the deadline, they must offer them at the conference rate.

If you'd like more contract details, write to <pycon at python dot org>.  Negotiate hard on any contract - the 2006/2007 contract with the hotel was highly customized.


Venue Requirements
==================

The bid must include rough cost information for all items below so
that we can estimate the required registration price.


Facilities 
----------

**Auditorium**: A large lecture-hall style room that can hold all
the conference attendees at one time (for keynotes).

**Meeting rooms**: Three rooms with a total capacity approximately
equal to that of the full assembly.  One of these rooms may be the
(possibly divided) auditorium.

**Common area**: A common area in which groups of attendees can
informally meet and where conference registration can take place.
Requires a number (4 or so) tables for registration.

**Sprint rooms**: two or more rooms for sprints.  These rooms are
usually re-used during the conference for open space talks.
Multiple sprints can run at the same time, so these rooms should
contain a number of tables that can seat ~10 people with their
laptops.  White boards for technical discussions are useful as well.

**Quiet room**: A room for people to use their laptops in silence.
This room should be able to seat 30-50 people at tables, and have an
Internet connection.

**Vendor & sponsor space**: Space in a high-visibility area (e.g., a
hallway) for vendor & sponsor tables.

**Storage**: A secure room in which to store supplies, including
materials for all the attendees and all necessary equipment.

All facilities should be accessible by disabled persons, and held
in controlled temperature environments (air-conditioned or heated
as needed).  

The location should be accessible by public transport.  It's a bonus
if there are interesting attractions nearby (museums, attractions,
etc.).

It is important to keep the time required for attendees to move between rooms at a minimum.  Therefore it is better if the rooms are located on one floor or that there be many elevators as well as stairs to handle the crowd movement.


Networking
----------

Internet access is extremely important to PyCon.

All areas of the conference (listed in Facilities_ above) need
wireless and wired Internet access, for almost **all attendees
simultaneously**.  The venue may be able to provide the networking, or
we may have to contract with a third party.  In either case, service
level guarantees and on-site support should be part of the agreement.

Bandwidth: as much as possible.  2006 had 4 T1 lines, for a total of
around 6mbps of bandwidth.  We were using around 4mbps, so 4mbps is 
probably around the minimum we can live with.  We are heavily inbound
oriented, but probably need at least 2mbps outbound bandwidth.

We need the ability to have quite a lot of associations with the 
wireless network.  We're probably going to be one of the venue's
heaviest per-attendee penetration of the wireless network.  
Comparing our 400-attendee usage to the vacuum salespeople's 400 
attendee usage is not a fair comparison.  Expect at least 200
(over 50%) simultaneous associations.

Free Internet access (wired or wireless) in hotel rooms would be 
nice, but is not a requirement.


Catering (optional)
------------------------

Catering is a major part of the cost of the conference.  If catering
is not provided, we should be able to arrange for outside catering,
and it must be included in the overall cost.

Provide: breakfast, snacks, and a light lunch for the three conference
days.  Some attendees will be vegetarian/vegan; some may require
lactose-free or low-carbohydrate meals.  While not all meals may be
provided, the resources must be available.  Snacks are less important
than lunch; if no meals are provided at all, the resulting
registration cost should reflect this.  Breakfast is convenient but
not obligatory.

If food will not be provided, there should be restaurants or other
places for lunch within walking distance.  There should be enough of
these to handle the conference attendance.  If there's only one small
restaurant within walking distance, it'll get swamped!


Accommodation
----------------

Nearby commercial hotels, restaurants, and social venues must be
available.

If the facility is a hotel: how many rooms does it have?  What would
the room rate be?

If the facility does not offer accommodation, some nearby inexpensive
accommodations, such as hostels, should be identified.


A/V Equipment
-------------------

**Auditorium and Meeting Rooms**: Public address system, and data
video projectors are required; transparency (overhead) projectors may
be useful.  Preferably wireless microphones as well as podium mics.


Transportation
-------------------

Nearby access to an airport, preferably a large one.  

Parking facilities or arrangements, as appropriate.  

How to arrive by public transport and taxi from the airport, or other
major points.


Volunteers
==================

Some parts of PyCon organization can be done remotely, but having
local volunteers is vital to the conference's success.  Volunteers
can:

* Explore locations before the conference.
* Receive deliveries in the weeks before the conference.
* Run the registration desk.
* Help advertise the conference locally at schools, user groups.
* Help prepare the conference rooms, wireless networking, badges, 
  conference tote bags, etc.

Does your location have a pool of volunteer labour?
