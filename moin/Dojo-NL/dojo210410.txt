At the last PUN meeting it was proposed to try out a coding dojo. There was some good reactions, so here we go!

The first dojo will held in the [[http://www.treehouse.abc.nl/index.php?page=location|ABC Treehouse in Amsterdam]], on the 21th of April at 19:30, until about 22:00.

In short:

Reversi is a board game for two players. This Kata is to write a program that takes a current board position together with information about whose turn it is, and returns a list of the legal moves for that player. A move is only legal if it results in at least one of the opponent's counters being flipped. Here's the catch, the program must be developed using test driven development. It's all in the pdf! See you soon.
