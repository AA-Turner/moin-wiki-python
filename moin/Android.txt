There are several ways to use Python on Android. The following table summarizes those projects which are currently active:

In addition, there are a number of projects which are inactive or incomplete:

 * SL4A (Scripting Layer for Android), originally named ASE (Android Scripting Environment), is a set of "facades" which expose a greatly-simplified subset of the Android API. The project was originally developed within Google, but is no longer supported by them. However, a fork  of the library is distributed with QPython.

 * PySide (the Python binding for the Qt toolkit) has some  [[http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide_for_Android_guide|preliminary support]] for Android. 

 * Although Android's primary programming language is Java, there is no known port of [[Jython]] to the platform.
