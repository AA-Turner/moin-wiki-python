= Other Persistent Storage Modules =

The modules listed on this page provide mechanisms for
storing data on disk.  Some modules are simply the disk-based equivalent of
dictionaries; others provide for persistent storage of arbitrary
Python objects.

== Disk-based Dictionaries ==

[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-anydbm.html anydbm]
Included with the standard Python distribution.  
The {{{anydbm}}} module is a generic interface to all the
DBM-like modules listed in the next two lines, selecting from 
whichever modules are installed.

[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-dbm.html DBM],[[BR]]
[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-gdbm.html GDBM],[[BR]]
[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-dbhash.html dbhash]
Included with the standard Python distribution.  Each 
of these modules is an interface to a specific library.

[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-bsddb.html BSDDB]
Included with the standard Python distribution.  In
addition to dictionary-like behaviour, this module also supports
B-trees, which allows traversing the keys in sorted order.

[http://www.equi4.com/metakit/ Metakit]
MetaKit is a C++ library  for storage, transport, and manipulation of
structured objects and collections.  A Python
interface is available.

[http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxBeeBase.html mxBeeBase]
mxBeeBase is a high performance construction kit for disk based
indexed databases. It offers components which you can plug
together to easily build your own custom mid-sized databases, up
to around 2Gb on 32-bit platforms).

== Data Writing and Parsing ==

PyTables reads and writes large amounts of numeric data. 

[http://python-dsv.sourceforge.net/ Python-DSV] parses comma-separated value (CSV) files or similar delimiter-separated files (see also PEP:0305).

== Persistent Objects ==

[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pickle.html pickle.py]
Included with the standard Python distribution.  The 
{{{pickle}}} module can convert Python objects to and from
a string representation.  
  
[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-shelve.html shelve.py]
Included with the standard Python distribution.
Built on top of the {{{pickle}}} and {{{anydbm}}}
modules, the {{{shelve}}} module behaves like a persistent
dictionary whose values can be arbitrary Python objects.
  
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pypersyst/ PyPerSyst]
A portable object database management system (ODBMS)
as well as a database application framework.  PyPerSyst works well
with Pyro and Twisted.
  
[http://starship.python.net/crew/jmenzel/ PyVersant]
A wrapper for the [http://www.versant.com Versant commercial OODBMS].
  

[http://wiki.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage ZODB]
The Zope Object Database is a persistent-object
system that provides transparent transactional object
persistence to Python applications.

[http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/ Durus]

Durus is a persistent object system that offers an easy way to use and maintain a consistent collection of object instances used by one or more processes. Changes to persistent instances are managed through a cached Connection instance that includes {{{commit()}}} and {{{abort() }}} methods so that changes are transactional.
