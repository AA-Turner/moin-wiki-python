Good day Pythonians, I'm new to the Python language, but I'm quite experienced in the front-end, including SEO.

I would like to suggest that we use an automatic ' rel="nofollow" ' for ALL the links of a 'newly' registered user's post. Link building is the very reason why people want to post their website links (even manually---which defeats the purpose of textCha, since a human can answer that) in high ranked website (like this).
