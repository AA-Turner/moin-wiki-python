Chair of PyCon DC 2003 and 2004.

Keeper of the [http://pydish.holdenweb.com/pwp PyDish], President of [http://www.holdenweb.com/ Holden Web LLC]

Member of the PSF Board.

Recently began planning activities for PyCon 2005. Currently [Aug 9, 2004] I'm tending towards

  a) Monday and Tuesday pre-conference for *preparational* activities. If someone is organizing a sprint, wants to runa  BoF, leave a message for another delegate (perhaps unnecessary in this electronic age, but a courtesy), help the chairman, check out the video projector situation or generally get ready -- in short, anything that helps make PyCON BETTER. This includes "helping the chairman" :-)

  b) Wednesday through Friday as a "traditional" PyCON, modulo whatever changes have been wrought by a determined group of volunteers who aren't being distracted by having to produce code.

  c) Saturday and Sunday as the main "sprint" activity, with the option of going on (assuming a breakout room is available) until the following Friday if necessary.

That means that the conference isn't disrupted and people's energies aren't diverted by pre-conference sprinting activity. It also means that many people will be able to stay on for at least two days of sprinting after the conference, at a time of maximum information and at least some residual energy.

Since the incremental cost of a room/day is relatively small we can provide huge value to out-of-town groups just by giving them a venue for (hopefully Python-related) activities for a few days longer. It also means that the sprint starts big and tails off rather than starting small and growing by accretion. LauraCreighton is happy, DavidAscher is happy, and if nobody is  BandMing about the sprints, I'm happy too.
