= About =

My name is Frances Hocutt. I'm working with [[SumanaHarihareswara]] and Changeset Consulting to audit and update documentation (including this wiki) to prepare for the final stages of the Python 2->3 transition. I've previously worked on [[https://www.mediawiki.org|MediaWiki]] and I use Python for personal projects and occasionally in my day job.
