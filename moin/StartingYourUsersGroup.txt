This page describes tips and best practices for '''group organizers''' in regards to:
 * '''Creating''' a new Python user group (You should have checked [[LocalUserGroups]] to ensure that there is not an existing group already).
 * '''Improving''' an existing Python user group.

== Getting the Word Out ==

  * Create a chapter on the http://python.meetup.com website.  Such chapters cost per month; some say $19.95/month but I'm paying $9.95/month so far.  It's a good way for people to find you though, and you can take donations from the membership.  Here in the DFW Pythoneers, we have found many of our members via this method.  (Much the same is true for Houston.)

  Standard ways of communicating meetings (i.e. you don't ''have'' to use one of the above sites):

   * mailing list, newsgroups (e.g. comp.lang.python.announce), twitter, email, RSS, etc.

  * Edit the wiki at http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups to get your user group listed.  Some people come here to find such groups.

  * Have a website, and preferably your own domain name.  

  * Have a location you can rely upon, monthly, without fail.

  * Get at least a second person you can count on as core members who will contribute regularly to the running of the group.

  * Identify other user groups in your area and, with their permission, post an announcement of your meetings.  For DFW Pythoneers we use the DFW Unix Users Group, and need to start making use of the .NET Users Group, the Apple Users Group and the North Texas Linux Users Group.

  * For each meeting or other event, post an email to the python-announce and python-users lists (need URLs to list?)  While, in my experience, many are not on these lists, it reaches another subset of the Python community you can't reach any other way.

  * Hang some flyers at your local college; hold some meetings on a campus and get listed as a campus organization.

  * Produce some podcasts (or even better screencasts) and get them listed on video.google.com, Python 411 and such.  Be sure to edit in a publicity blurb about your user group.

  * Set up a Google adwords (or similar) campaign targeting your local geographic area for search terms such as Python, Java, and scripting.  Keeping the spread local keeps the cost reasonable.  We targeted the province of Manitoba in Canada, population 1 million, for http://WinniPUG.ca, both Python and Java, for about $60 per year, and it generated a lot of interest.  We pass a hat at meetings to cover the cost.

 * Consider putting your group on facebook, upcoming, and other places.  Note that there is a cost to putting your energies into keeping these multiple places up to date, but it can get you users who would otherwise not find you.  So you need to balance your time constraints to your desire to grow the size of the group.

== Finding the right location ==
 
 * Businesses that are heavily invested in your technology may sponsor your group.

 * Libraries often have space available, although their hours can be limited

 * In NYC, there are bars that host groups on off-nights - they can see it as a way to fill their bar with tech people.

 * Coworking spaces are often a good choice as well, as they want their members to be able to network.

== Organizing Activities ==

  ''Decide on the flavor of your meetings.''
 
There are lots of different things to do at meetings.

 * Presenters

 * Lightning talks

 * Code reviews
 
 * Display videos

 * Standard module of the month

 * Some people are looking for social opportunities and here in Dallas we hold
    those once a month, an evening at a local restaurant.

 * Others want something more in-depth; we hold twice-monthly Saturday afternoon
    sesssions at a local bookstore that has wireless.  Sometimes we have
    presentations and other times sprints, with hands-on coding.

 * Some people find it works not to have a topic but just have people talk about what they've found interesting and what they're working on.

 * Often groups meet for beer/food before and/or after the meeting, to give people a chance to congregate and hang out after the meeting place has closed.

== Possible Group Projects ==

  * Put together a club website using one of the many Python web frameworks.

  * Establish a club mailing list, wiki and subversion repository.

  * Consider producing audio recordings ala podcasts, an especially good option if your group is geographically dispersed or cannot agree on meeting times/locations.

  * Work to run a "scripting conference" in your area, bringing together proponents of the various languages.  Some people will convert, either because your group looks like more fun or Python is such a cool language.

  * Work to run a "web technology conference" in your area, bringing together proponents of the various approaches.  Many just want *something* to easily produce web sites and if Python is more friendly, they'll give it a try.

== Speakers ==

I've found that keeping the presentations short, and maybe having two or three speakers, is a good alternative to having one speaker (unless a good speaker volunteers!).  It takes some of the load off the speaker and gets more people involved.

== Social meetings ==

Some groups hold social meetings occasionally, often inviting other tech groups.  This can be a potluck affair so that the only real
concern is getting the space.  The portland group has a twice-a-year social even where the dynamic-language groups all get together.

== Presenting for upcoming conferences ==

A local meeting is a good place to have members practice for upcoming conferences.  You may find that if you can find three people to give a presentation on a topic that suddenly you are creating something larger.

== Hack sessions ==

I don't have experience with this yet, but if you get people together to work on projects, you can have some people show up with projects they're already interested in and have others show up without projects and people will gravitate towards the projects they're interested in. It works well if experienced programmers come with projects and the less experienced programmers can pair up with them.  I'd love to hear more about how to make these work.

== Other types of meetings ==

One of the amazing things about tech today is that if you state clearly that something is going to happen, and give people enough
information about what you're planning, people will show up.  Some other types of meetings I've heard people running or participating in:

 * Startup weekend.

 * Unconferences/barcamp

 * Saturday house

 * Local conferences

Your group could host any one of these.

= Day-to-day operation =
If you are organizing a user group event, please consider adding the event to the [[http://pycon.org#calendar|Python Event Calendar]] on pycon.org and in the side bar of the python.org website. This calendar is administered by a group of volunteers. Please see the [[PythonEventsCalendar|PythonEventsCalendar]] wiki page for details on how to get events listed.

The [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/group-organizers|Group-organizers]] mailing list supports people starting and running user groups.

Also, please consider posting news from your user group on the [[http://python-groups.blogspot.com/|Python User Group Blog]]!

You may draw on the PythonSpeakers page to help find speakers.
