Even though Python is an interpreted language, you may need to install Windows C++ compilers in some cases. Unlike Linux, compilers for Windows are not included by default in the OS.

For example, you will need to use them if you wish to:

 * Install a non-pure Python package from sources with [[https://pip.pypa.io/|Pip]] (if there is no [[http://wheel.readthedocs.org|Wheel package]] provided).
 * Compile a [[http://cython.org/|Cython]] or [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyrex|Pyrex]] file.

Microsoft provides official C++ compilers called ''Visual C++'', you can find them bundled with ''Visual Studio'' or, for some versions, in standalone distributions. Some alternative compilers exist like [[http://mingw.org/|MinGW]], but incompatibilities may occur with a CPython official distribution that is built with Microsoft Visual C++.

The compiler's architecture must be the same as Python's (for example: if you use Python 64bit, you have to use an x64 compiler).

= Which Microsoft Visual C++ compiler to use with a specific Python version ? =
Each Python version uses a specific compiler version (e.g. ''CPython 2.7'' uses ''Visual C++ 9.0'', ''CPython 3.3'' uses ''Visual C++ 10.0'', etc). So, you need to install the compiler version that corresponds to your Python version  :
||'''Visual C++''' ||'''CPython''' ||
||14.x ||3.5 - 3.12+ ||
||10.0 ||3.3 - 3.4 ||
||9.0 ||2.6 - 2.7, 3.0 - 3.2 ||

Please also have a look at [[https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html#windows|The Python Dev Guide for Windows]] to check for additional requirements or updates to the above table.

= Distutils notes =
If the package's ''setup.py'' (still) uses ''distutils'' rather than the [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/distutils.html|recommended]] ''setuptools'', you may need extra steps:

 * ''distutils'' only supports the very minimum of compiler setups. The sections in this guide corresponding to them explicitly mention ''distutils''.
 * For other setups, you need to run the compilation from the "SDK prompt" of the corresponding toolchain and set the ''DISTUTILS_USE_SDK'' environment variable to a non-empty value.

= Compilers Installation and configuration =
Compatible architectures are specified for each compiler in brackets.

/!\ Before do anything, install or upgrade the ''Setuptools'' Python package. It contain compatibility improvements and add automatic use of compilers:

{{{
pip install --upgrade setuptools
}}}

== Microsoft Visual C++ 14.x with Visual Studio 2022 (x86, x64, ARM, ARM64) ==

 * Install ''[[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/|Microsoft Visual Studio 2022]]'' (or later).
 * Install the ''Python development'' workload and the optional ''Python native development tools'' option.
 * Install the latest ''Windows SDK'' (under ''Native development'' in the installer).
 * Optional: Set {{{$env:PlatformToolset}}} to your toolset version before building, if it doesn't detect it.
 * Update to the latest ''setuptools'' Python package version.

For additional details, please have a look at the Windows section of the [[https://devguide.python.org/setup/#windows|Python Development Guide]] and the [[https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/PCbuild/python.props|PCbuild/python.props]] file for full details on how Python is built on Windows.
