'''Core Python Programming'''
 Wesley J. Chun

ISBN:0130260363,
Prentice Hall PTR,
816 pages (January 2001)

From an anonymous reviewer: "Very well written. It is the clearest,
friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining 
Python, and
putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of
other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it
does go into some important Python topics carefully and in
depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or
tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. Not too
many in-depth real-world examples in the book (hopefully he will do a
followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax
and structure."

Covers up to Python 2.0.  CD-ROM for Unix, Win32, and MacOS.
