= Simple Networking For Pygame =

Write a simple network library which integrates with the pygame event queue. 

== Basic requirements: ==
 * Seamless reconnection
 * Support TCP and UDP
 * use select based non blocking IO
 * network library is iterated manually (so we use our own event loops)

== Potential API: ==
 * connect(url, onConnection, onLostConnection)
 * send(conn, data)
 * recv(conn, num_bytes)
 * listen(url, onConnection, onLostConnection)

== Things not to worry about: ==
 * Object serialization
