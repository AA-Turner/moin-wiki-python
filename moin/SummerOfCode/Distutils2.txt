This page describes a possible Summer of Code project for Distutils2

'''Contact: Tarek Ziadé <tarek@ziade.org>'''

== GSOC Tasks ==

 * XML-RPC client for distutils 2: http://bugs.python.org/issue8190
 * Make it possible to use setup.cfg to describe all the metatadata: http://bugs.python.org/issue8252
 * Describe the resources files and the Python files using a [resources] section in setup.cfg: http://bugs.python.org/issue8253
 * Write a configure command: http://bugs.python.org/issue8254
 * Write a tutorial: http://bugs.python.org/issue8255
 * Promote and evangelize Distutils2–This will consist of helping python project to switch to/adopt Distutils2. 
 We will define a list of targets at the beginning and the student will be in charge of helping them switching to Distutils2 if they want.
 * Add a post/pre commit hook for install and uninstall commands: http://bugs.python.org/issue8312
 * Make sure distutils2 works under Py3
 * Move the code from distribute to distutils2 (upload_doc, use_2to3)
 * Implement pkgutil APIs described in PEP 376 : http://bugs.python.org/issue8250  -- work started by people in the community already.
 * Add a test command: http://bugs.python.org/issue8324

== Coding task -- Deadline: April 17th ==

Write a small Python application that will do the following:

 * provide a XML-RPC client that knows how to list all releases of a given project at PyPI (no need to implement the whole XML-RPC spec, but think about this as something we can reuse later during the GSOC, to implement the whole XML-RPC spec)

 * provide a script called "install_distribution.py" that will be used to  download the distribution and install it, using "python setup.py install"

The CLI can be used like this:

{{{ 
  $ install_distribution.py Foo
  Found versions of Foo:
        1.1
        1.2
  Which version do you want to install (hit enter for None)?
}}}

 or:

{{{
  $ install_distribution.py Foo 1.1 
}}}  

The code should be unit-tested, and documented. The goal is not to make you write something you don't know how to write, but to see how you write/organize code to help me select the student. So, I am available online for any question help.
