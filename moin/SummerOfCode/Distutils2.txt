'''Contact: Tarek Ziadé <tarek@ziade.org>'''

== GSOC Tasks ==

=== PEP 376 support ===

 * Implement pkgutil APIs described in PEP 376 : http://bugs.python.org/issue8250  -- work started by people in the community already. 
 (focus on speed with benches)
 * Implement a dependency-graph builder
 * Add basic PEP 376 support in Distribute  [and Pip is possible]

=== Installer / Uninstaller, PyPI ===

 * Implement Distutils2 APIs described in PEP 376.
 * Add the uninstall command.
 * think about a basic installer / uninstaller script. (with deps) -- similar to pip/easy_install
 * in a pypi subpackage;
   * Integrate a module similar to setuptools' package_index
   * PyPI XML-RPC client for distutils 2: http://bugs.python.org/issue8190
 
=== Distutils new commands ===

 * Add a post/pre commit hook for install and uninstall commands: http://bugs.python.org/issue8312
 see if it can be generic.
 * enhance the check command (sanity tests)
 * Move the upload_doc command from distribute 
 * add an optional call to upload_doc into upload
 * Add a test command: http://bugs.python.org/issue8324

=== Distutils build tool ===

 * Study 4Suite' configure command
 * Write a configure command: http://bugs.python.org/issue8254
 * Make install and build optionnaly use the configure file
 * Make it possible to use setup.cfg to describe all the metatadata: http://bugs.python.org/issue8252
 * Describe the resources files and the Python files using a [resources] or [packages] [py_modules] 
 section in setup.cfg: http://bugs.python.org/issue8253
 * make setup.py optional (commands would be called trhough a -m call)

=== Py3 support ===

 * Move the use_2to3 command from distribute 
 * Make sure distutils2 works under Py3 using 2to3
 
=== Tasks for all ===

 * Write a small tutorial in docs/ for each feature you add 

=== Misc ===

 * complete tutorial : http://bugs.python.org/issue8255
 * Promote and evangelize Distutils2–This will consist of helping python project to switch to/adopt Distutils2. 
 We will define a list of targets at the beginning and the student will be in charge of helping them switching to Distutils2 if they want.
