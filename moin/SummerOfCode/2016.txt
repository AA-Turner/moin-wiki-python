= Google Summer of Code 2016 @ the Python Software Foundation =
[[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] is a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.  Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has served as as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the Python language.  Assuming the GSoC program runs in 2016, it is our intention to apply as a mentoring organization again.  This page will coordinate those efforts if and when a 2016 program is announced.  

Please check back in around January 2016 for more information.
