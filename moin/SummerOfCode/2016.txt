= Google Summer of Code 2016 @ the Python Software Foundation =
[[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] is a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.  Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has served as as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the Python language.  Assuming the GSoC program runs in 2016, it is our intention to apply as a mentoring organization again.  This page will coordinate those efforts if and when a 2016 program is announced.  

If you are curious about how GSoC works, you might want to look at [[SummerOfCode/2015]] to see how we ran things last year and who participated.

Please check back in around January 2016 for more information on the 2016 program.

{{{#!wiki caution
'''Please check back in January 2016'''

With GSoC 2015 just finished, please remember that many mentors are looking forwards to having some time to hack on their own projects.  While it's never too early to get involved in open source, if you want to make the best impression on your communities, you might do best not to ask about GSoC and instead ask things like "How can I help?" or "I've tried to fix this bug, do you have some time to review my code?"
