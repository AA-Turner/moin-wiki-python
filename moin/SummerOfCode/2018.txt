'''You're early!'''

You're way too early!  Google Summer of Code 2017 is underway and our mentors are focusing on their existing students.  Please try not to bother them about GSoC 2018 until final evals are in (Circa September 2017) and they've confirmed participation in 2018 (Circa Februrary 2018).  You can get involved in open source any time, but now's not the time to talk about GSoC!
