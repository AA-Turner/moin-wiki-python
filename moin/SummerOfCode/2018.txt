'''You're early!'''

You're way too early!  Google Summer of Code 2017 is wrapping up and our mentors are focusing on finishing up merging code from their 2017 students.  Please try not to bother them too much about GSoC 2018 until they've confirmed participation in 2018 (Circa Februrary 2018).  You can get involved in open source any time, but now's not the time to talk about GSoC!
