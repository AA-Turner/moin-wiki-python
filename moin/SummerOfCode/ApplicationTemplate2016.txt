Python Software Foundation 2016 Google Summer of Code Application.

Fields at the top of this form are required.  Sub-orgs may require additional information; please contact your mentors to be sure that your application is complete before the submission deadline.

= sub org info =
 * Which python sub-org are you applying to work with? (e.g. Dipy, MyHDL)

= student info =
 * Name:
 * Alternate names: (e.g. github username, irc nick, any other preferred names)
 * Email:
 * Telephone:
 * Time Zone:  
 * GSoC Blog RSS Feed URL: 
   * You will be '''required '''to blog about your GSoC experience approximately every 2 weeks through the summer.  The RSS feed is used to aggregate student blogs; we recommend using a tag like "python" or "gsoc" if you use this blog for anything other than GSoC.  

= code sample =

 * Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org (*)
  * Note: '''Python requires all students to submit a patch.''' This does not need to be accepted and merged into your project, but it does need to be online and available for potential mentors to inspect. Contact your mentors if you have questions about what constitutes an appropriate sample.   ''''Applications without a valid code sample will be rejected.''''

= project info =

 * Proposal Title:
  * The name of your proposal. This should explain in a few words what you plan to do and include the name of your sub-org. e.g. "QTile: Refactor window focusing" or "Kivy: Matplotlib Integration."

 * Proposal Abstract:
  * A short description of your proposed project

 * Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline (*)
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. You may wish to read the GSoC student guide which includes several examples of good proposals with timelines, or our own information at SummerOfCode/Application
  * Note that any pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during the community bonding period before May 23. Students will be expected to start producing code starting May 23.

= Other commitments = 

* Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period, May 23rd to August 23rd? 
  * Do you have exams or classes that overlap with this period?
  * Do you plan to have any other jobs or internships during this period?  
    * This is highly '''NOT RECOMMENDED''' as GSoC is intended to be a full-time job, but sometimes if a student is starting or finishing an internship with a week or two overlap something can be worked out.
  * Do you have any short term commitments during this period? 
    * e.g family wedding, conference, planned vacation days
  * Please be honest and adjust your schedule above to take into account any commitments.
