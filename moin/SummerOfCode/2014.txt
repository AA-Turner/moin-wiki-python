This page coordinates the [[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] projects involving Python under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) for 2014.

The Python Software Foundation serves as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the Python language.  

The 2014 PSF GSoC coordinator is TerriOda (at gmail.com).  Please direct any questions to her until the mailing lists are set up.

= Prospective Students =

If you are a student interested in working on core Python development or on a project that helps the Python community, we'd love to have you apply to the Python Software Foundation for this year's Google Summer of Code!

We're currently in the process of finding mentors and getting ideas pages set up, but if you want to get a head start, you might want to look at [[SummerOfCode/2013|last year's]] page to find out what projects might be involved again this year.  Choose a project or projects that sound interesting to you, subscribe to their mailing list or join their IRC channel, and try to set up a development environment.  Usually, jumping right in and trying to solve a few bugs is a good place to start and way to make a good first impression!

Students should read [[SummerOfCode/Expectations]] to understand what is expected of accepted students.

Please read [[SummerOfCode/Application]] for help completing your application.  Templates will be available once we have been officially accepted as a mentoring organization.


Have questions?
 1. For general Summer of Code questions:
  * We'll be setting up a mailing list for prospective students in the next few weeks.  Watch this space for details once it's up!
  * We've set up an IRC channel: #python-gsoc on Freenode.  Stop by and ask questions there if any of the mentors are awake!
 2. For questions about a specific project, get in touch with the folk from that project. Scroll down for mailing list and IRC info for the projects currently registered to participate with us.

For dates and deadlines, see [[https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014|the GSoC official website]]. (Scroll down past the calendar to just get a list of dates.)

= Prospective Mentors = 

Please read [[SummerOfCode/Expectations]] to understand what is expected of GSoC project mentors.  

 * If you know what project you'd like to work with, get in touch with their GSoC coordinator to get details on how to sign up with them directly.
 * If you don't know what project you'd like to work with, get in touch with TerriOda to find out which projects need more mentoring support.  

New mentors are always welcome, and we have a variety of experienced mentors who can help with questions you have about mentoring!  If you're new or unsure about the time commitment, we can often have you be a "backup mentor" in your first year so that you're paired with someone who's done this before!

  * We've set up an IRC channel: #python-gsoc on Freenode.  Stop by and ask questions there!

= Prospective Projects = 

Please get in touch with TerriOda if you'd like to participate under the Python umbrella!

You will need:
1. At least 3 mentors willing to mentor students for your project.  (If you're having trouble finding enough mentors, talk to Terri to get linked up with prospective mentors who don't have projects.)
2. An ideas page with clear project ideas for students to choose or use as a base to propose their own projects.

Alas, we don't have the resources to accept ''every'' project, but we try to support projects with a clear commitment to python!

If you're a python-related project that is hoping to apply as a separate mentoring organization (i.e. not under the python umbrella) we're also happy to link your ideas page here to help you advertise.  Again, get in touch with TerriOda to make that happen.

= Project Ideas =
Ideas for projects and links to Python-related teams' idea pages will appear here once mentors have gotten in touch with TerriOda.  

If you are unsure if your favourite Python project will be participating, ask them and encourage them to sign up!
