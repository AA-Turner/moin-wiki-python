= CPython =

CPython is the default, most widely used implementation of the Python programming language. It is mostly written in C, most of the modules are written in Python itself. In case you want to make the changes which will be used by all the Python programmers worldwide, this is the project to work for. 

== Contacting CPython developers ==

One can contact the core developers over IRC or using mailing lists. #python-dev (on freenode) is the channel for core developers, [[https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship|the core mentorship mailing list]] is the place to an email discussion. Remember that the developers are may not be in your timezone, so it might take time to get a reply from anyone.

== Getting Started ==

The best place to get started is the [[ https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html | devguide]]. You will find all the instructions required to build your own CPython. Before contacting the mentors, it is better you start solving few [[http://bugs.python.org/| bugs]] first.

= Ideas =

We're still waiting to find out which mentors are available for Core Python/CPython projects.  In the meantime, you can discuss ideas on [[https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship|the core mentorship mailing list]].

== 1. bugs.python.org improvements ==

 * '''Project description''':  The goal of this project is to improve the [[https://bugs.python.org/|bug tracker used by CPython]].
 * '''Skills''': Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Roundup, DVCS.
 * '''Difficulty level''': Intermediate.
 * '''Related Readings/Links''':  The details are still being discussed on the [[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/core-workflow/2015-March/thread.html#132|core-workflow ML]].
 * '''Potential mentors''': Ezio Melotti.


== 2. Use more unittest features in regrtest ==

 * '''Project description''':  The goal of this project is to improve the CPython test suite by using more unittest features.
 * '''Skills''': Python, unittest.
 * '''Difficulty level''': Intermediate.
 * '''Related Readings/Links''':  http://bugs.python.org/issue10967, https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/test/regrtest.py
 * '''Potential mentors''': No mentor (you can put together a proposal and ask for one on [[https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship|the core mentorship ML]]).
