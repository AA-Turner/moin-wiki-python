== 2. A gui (tkinter) front end for pip ==
 * '''Project description''':  Many users are not familiar with the command line and thus find difficulties using and accessing PIP.  This project would involve creating interactive menus to help guide new users through the process of installing packages using PIP.  https://bugs.python.org/issue23551 contains preliminary design ideas.

Such a visual tool would be extremely useful, and I would make it accessible from IDLE.  Once a basic version were written, the additional feature set for the project could be adjusted to fit the time remaining.
