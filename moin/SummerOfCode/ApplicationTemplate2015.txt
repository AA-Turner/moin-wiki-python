= 2015 Google Summer of Code Proposal Template =

NOTE: Things marked with an * are '''REQUIRED'''. Failure to provide the requested information may result in your application being rejected. 

It is '''HIGHLY RECOMMENDED''' that you submit your proposal early and make changes as you refine it with your mentors.  (And yes, you should discuss your proposal with mentors and get their help to improve it!)   You can make changes in Melange up until the final deadline on March 27, 2015 19:00 UTC (note the time and time zone). No late proposals will be accepted by Google, even if there is a technical problem with the system, so submit early to avoid problems!  You may indicate at the top that the current version is a draft or otherwise let us know if you don't want us to look at it yet.

It is also recommended that you discuss your proposal with your prospective mentors before the deadline.  They are allowed (and encouraged!) to help you make the best possible proposal.

== Sub-organization information ==
 
 * Sub-organization with whom you hope to work(*): 
 (e.g. !SymPy, NetworkX, etc. See [[SummerOfCode/2015]] for the list of valid sub-organizations) 

You must also put your sub-org information in the title of your proposal, as it makes it easier for mentors to find proposals for their sub-orgs in the melange system.

== Student Information ==

 * Name(*): 
 * Email(*): 
 * Telephone(*): 
 * Time zone(*): 
  (You can specify more than one if you expect to travel during the GSoC period.)

 * IRC handle including network: 
  (e.g. valid_nickname_here@irc.network.tld) 
 * Source control username(s)(*):
   Provide your user id on Launchpad, Github, Sourceforge, or whatever system your project uses

 * Instant Messaging information: 
 * Twitter:  
 * Any other ways we can reach you: 

 * Home Page(s): 
 * Blog(s)(*): 
   Note: '''Blogging about your progress for GSoC will be required.'''  You will need to blog every 2 weeks.  If you do not yet have a blog or want to have one specifically for GSoC, please set one up via a service like http://blogger.com before submitting your application. 
 * GSoC Blog RSS feed(*):
  This will be included on a blog aggregator for all the GSoC student blogs and probably on Planet Python as well in 2014, so please make sure it will be only relevant and appropriate content.  (Note the [[http://python.org/psf/codeofconduct/|Python Community Code of Conduct]].)  We recommend using a tag of "GSoC" or "Python" on your blog.
 * Other personal information you think we would find relevant: 

== University Information ==

 * University(*): 
 * Major(*): 
 * Current Year and Expected Graduation date(*): 
 * Degree(*) (e.g. BSc, PhD):

== Project Proposal Information ==

 * Proposal Title (*)
   The name of your proposal. This should explain in a few words what you plan to do and include the name of your sub-org. e.g. "QTile: Refactor window focusing" or "Kivy: Matplotlib Integration." 
 * Proposal Abstract (*)
   A short description of your proposed project 
 * Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline (*) 
   Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. You may wish to read [[http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/ch008_writing-a-proposal/|the GSoC student guide]] which includes several examples of good proposals with timelines, or our own information at [[SummerOfCode/Application]] 

   * Note that any pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during the community bonding period (April 27-May 24).  Students will be expected to start producing code starting on May 25th.
 * Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org (*)
   Note: '''Python requires all students to submit a patch.''' This does not need to be accepted and merged into your project, but it does need to be online and available for potential mentors to inspect.  It should be a patch for the sub-org with whom you will be working if accepted for GSoC, unless your mentors specifically indicate to you that another code sample would be acceptable.  Contact your mentors if you are unsure what would be an appropriate patch to submit. 
 * Links to additional information 
   (e.g. other projects, resources, code you've written, relevant information. You may wish to include a link to your resume here to help mentors evaluate your experience level.) 

== Other Schedule Information ==

 * Please indicate any vacations or other time off that you may be taking or expecting to take over the course of the summer. Any time that you would not be expecting to work should be noted here, along with a reason.  (e.g. "June 12-15th, travel for my sister's wedding" "May 30, midterm exam")  Google expects you to work 40h/week for the entire GSoC period, so consider how you will make up any lost time (you may have to start coding during community bonding, for example).
   * Note: We don't penalize students for needing adjustments to schedule if they're up-front about them and have a plan to mitigate any issues.  However, we *have* failed students for lying about their availability and subsequently falling behind in their work.  Be honest!

 * Please indicate any other commitments you have that you think we should know about.  (e.g. part time-jobs, large volunteer projects, summer courses)

 * Have you applied with any other organizations?  If so, do you have a preferred project/org?  (This will help us in the event that more than one organization decides they wish to accept your proposal.)

== Sub-organization specific information ==

 * If your sub-org requests any additional information, please don't forget to include it here!


= Notes for submitting a proposal =

The information requested above is generally required for us to be able to contact you and evaluate your proposal. Please feel free to add information to this template and to format it in whatever way you think will be most effective in conveying your intentions. You may wish to check with your sub-organization to see if they have any additional requirements.
 
We strongly recommend that you join the respective IRC channels for the sub-organizations you are applying to, and any relevant development mailing lists to the projects you are interested in working on to learn more about the community. You may wish to get your prospective mentors to read your proposals in advance so they can help you refine them.

Students should be contacting the mentors and the sub-organizations about projects and proposals.  It is ultimately the mentors for each project who select students, so they are your most valuable resource for what constitutes a great proposal.  

Mentors are often available on IRC, as well as the respective sub-organizations mailing lists. The mailing list for each sub-org is listed here: [[SummerOfCode/2015]].  As a reciprocal courtesy students are expected to also be regularly available on IRC and/or available via e-mail and reasonably responsive to questions and requests for improvements. Students are encouraged to help other students with proposals and help answer questions in IRC or the mailing lists.

If for any reason you have not been able to find a mentor who can help you with your proposal, or you have a question that you think will be relevant to more than just your sub-organization, you can direct your questions to the soc2015-general@python.org mailing list. You should sign up here before you post: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2015-general/  If you absolutely need to get in touch with the Python org admins, you can do so using the mail alias soc2015-general-owner@python.org
