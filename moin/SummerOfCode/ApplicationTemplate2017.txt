= Python Software Foundation 2017 Google Summer of Code Application. =

Fields at the top of this form are required.  Please contact your mentors if you have any questions, and to make sure that your application is complete after it is submitted.  Ideally, a GSoC application is a '''collaborative''' process, so please adjust based on any feedback you are given. 

{{{#!wiki caution
'''Use a good project title in Google's submission system'''

Your project title should explain in a few words what you plan to do and '''include the name of your sub-org'''. e.g. "QTile: Refactor window focusing" or "Kivy: Matplotlib Integration."  

Python gets 100+ submissions some years, and it can be very hard for mentors to find your projects if they all have generic titles like "my gsoc application." A good title can help you get early feedback that will make you more likely to get accepted, and a bad title could result in your application getting marked as spam and ignored!

= sub org info =
 * Which python sub-org are you applying to work with? (e.g. Dipy, MyHDL)
    * You MUST specify this.  If we have to guess, your application could be rejected in favour of students who followed instructions.

= student info =
 * Name:
 * Alternate names: (e.g. github username, irc nick, any other preferred names)
 * Email:
 * Telephone:
 * Time Zone:  
 * GSoC Blog RSS Feed URL: 
   * You will be '''required '''to blog about your GSoC experience approximately every 2 weeks through the summer.  The RSS feed is used to aggregate student blogs; we recommend using a tag like "python" or "gsoc" if you use this blog for anything other than GSoC.  

= code sample =

 * Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org (*)
  * Note: '''Python requires all students to submit a patch.''' This does not need to be accepted and merged into your project, but it does need to be online and available for potential mentors to inspect. Contact your mentors if you have questions about what constitutes an appropriate sample.   '''Applications without a valid code sample will be rejected.'''

= project info =

 * Proposal Title:
  * The name of your proposal. This should explain in a few words what you plan to do and '''include the name of your sub-org'''. e.g. "QTile: Refactor window focusing" or "Kivy: Matplotlib Integration."  (Including the name of your sub-org makes it much easier for mentors to find your proposal!)

 * Proposal Abstract:
  * A short description of your proposed project

 * Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline (*)
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. You may wish to read the GSoC student guide which includes several examples of good proposals with timelines, or our own information at SummerOfCode/Application
  * Note that any pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during the community bonding period, not after coding has started.

= other commitments =

 * Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? 
  * '''We don't penalize students for needing adjustments to schedule if they're up-front about them and have a plan to mitigate any issues. However, we *have* failed students for lying about their availability and subsequently falling behind in their work. Be honest!'''
  * Do you have exams or classes that overlap with this period?
  * Do you plan to have any other jobs or internships during this period?  
    * This is highly '''NOT RECOMMENDED''' as GSoC is intended to be a full-time job, but sometimes if a student is starting or finishing an internship with a week or two overlap something can be worked out.
  * Do you have any other short term commitments during this period? 
    * e.g family wedding, conference, volunteer projects, planned vacation days

 * Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
