Drop new project ideas here, make sure to include a list of skills that'd be needed (C, Java, OpenGL, WSGI, etc) and a link to a mentor's contact info who can field questions about the project.  Sign with your own email address (if different) in case you need to be contacted.

In most cases we'll add it to the list within an hour.  We've made this page to avoid edit conflicts and because some people have had trouble editing the large table on the main ideas page.
