Drop new project ideas here, make sure to include a list of skills that'd be needed (C, Java, OpenGL, WSGI, etc) and a link to a mentor's contact info who can field questions about the project.  Sign with your own email address (if different) in case you need to be contacted.

In most cases we'll add it to the list within an hour.  We've made this page to avoid edit conflicts and because some people have had trouble editing the large table on the main ideas page.

= Overhaul struct + PEP 3118 =

There are many open issues for the struct module, and [[http://bugs.python.org/msg81911|a suggestion]] that many others fixes should happen. The problems include inconsistencies in input handling and backwards-compatibility code that should be gone from 3.x.

As [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/|PEP 3118]] also requires [[http://bugs.python.org/issue3132|a few changes in struct]], finishing the [[http://bugs.python.org/issue2394|memoryview object implementation]] and [[http://bugs.python.org/issue2396|backporting it to 2.7]] could be part of this project. 

To tackle this, a student should know C and have some familiarity with the CPython codebase. The proposal should include an overview of open issues and, if possible, of problems in current code.

Mentors for this task should have a good understanding of the struct module, the buffer interface and PEP 3118.
