The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is looking for GSoC students to work on Python itself, or associated libraries and utilities.  Generally, applications written in Python are not eligible for funding, although we recognize that the line between "application" and "library" can be a bit fuzzy.

This year we're focusing on python 3 work: in particular, projects that involve porting libraries and applications from Python 2.x to Python 3.x will get high priority.

Before submitting an application,

 * read the [[SummerOfCode/Expectations]] to understand what is expected of you if you participate.

 * join the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2010-general|soc2010-general]] list.

 * contact either a mentor or the list itself to inquire about the suitability of your idea(s).

Your goal is to develop an application in concert with one or more possible mentors, taking their feedback to heart and revising your application accordingly.  Applications with no willing mentors will generally not be considered, and mentor opinions are taken very seriously in the review process, so you want to impress them.

Your application should discuss, in some detail, the following points:

 * what the project is.

 * your proposed week-by-week work plan.

 * what source code repository you will work in and how and when you will communicate with your mentor.

Please also include the URL of your blog '''in your application'''.  If you don't have one, you will need to get one; weekly blog posts are a requirement for participation.
