There are not very many strict requirements for Google Summer of Code Ideas pages, but there are some things that students often ask us for.  This page is intended as a starting template for organizations so you don't forget those things.

Warning: In 2014, many orgs got rejected because their ideas pages were offline when google checked.  '''Make sure your ideas page is hosted somewhere that Google's Open Source Programs Office will be able to access when they check!'''
