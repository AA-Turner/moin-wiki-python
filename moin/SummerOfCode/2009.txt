This page coordinates the [[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] projects involving Python and mentored by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) in 2009.

= Prospective Students =

If you are a student interested in working on core Python development or on a project that helps the Python community, we'd love to have you apply to the Python Software Foundation for this year's Google Summer of Code.

You should join the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2009-general|soc2009-general]] mailing list and take a look at the Project Ideas section below. If any interest you, feel free to contact the proposer for details. You can also discuss your own project ideas with the people mentioned or talk about them on the soc2009-general mailing list. Some of us also hang out on #gsoc-python on freenode.

Students should read [[SummerOfCode/Expectations]] to understand what is expected of them.
