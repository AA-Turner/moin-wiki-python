= A Pygame GUI Toolkit. =

'''On second thoughts, this sort of project probably isn't needed, for many different reasons.''' - SimonWittber

Build a minimal object oriented GUI toolkit, aimed at use with touchscreens, which uses pygame for display.
It should use something like a command dispatch pattern, and make sure to take advantage of the late binding abilities of python.

The minimum widgets needed are:
 * Labels
 * Tool Tips
 * Text Entry (with possible optional virtual keyboard)
 * Buttons
 * Heirarchial Pie Menu System
 * Spacer
 * Dialogs with Customisable buttons

It should also provide customisable layout managers for widget layout. Grid, Horizontal and Vertical Row etc.
