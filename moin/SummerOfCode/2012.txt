This page coordinates the [[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] projects involving Python under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) in 2012.

The 2012 PSF GSoC coordinator is ArcRiley (at gmail.com). Contact him if you have any questions.

----
= Prospective Students =

If you are a student interested in working on core Python development or on a project that helps the Python community, we'd love to have you apply to the Python Software Foundation for this year's Google Summer of Code.

You should join the [[http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soc2012-general|soc2012-general]] mailing list and take a look at the Project Ideas section below. These ideas are intended to give a general idea what each project is looking for, you're strongly encouraged to talk with developers from these projects to learn more about them and flesh out your proposal.

Application deadline is Friday, April 6th.  We strongly encourage you to submit your application(s) much earlier than this so you can work with your prospective mentor(s) in refining your application.

By Monday, April 16th all prospective students are required to have completed the following to pass final screening:
 * Demonstrate to your prospective mentor(s) that you are able to complete the project you've proposed
 * Blog for their GSoC project.  Free blogs are available at [[http://www.blogger.com/]]
 * Contribute at least one patch to the project(s) you're applying to work with

The code contribution is intended to demonstrate your ability to work with the project's toolchain, your current programming skill in contrast with the goals stated in your application, and your ability to work with the project's developers.

Students should read [[SummerOfCode/Expectations]] to understand what is expected of accepted students.

Please read [[SummerOfCode/Application]] for help completing your application.

If your team has not done so already, please contact ArcRiley to participate in GSoC under the PSF umbrella.

If your team has already been accepted it should appear below.  Have your project's contact person email ArcRiley with your name, email, phone #, and link_id to be added to the mentor's mailing list and approved as a PSF mentor.
