There's no specific set of requirements or even a specific goal for a
web-based Python IDE, but here are some thoughts you might find
interesting in shaping a proposal:

 * I think this is most interesting when targetting a relatively new
 Python programmer.  Experienced programmers already have tools.  If
 you can make the IDE useful for people using external editors, that
 might be a good idea, and will include the potential audience.

 * The environment should be basically framework neutral.  It might
 (and probably should) use some framework underneath, but it's
 primary UI doesn't need to integrate in any framework.  Also,
 there's problems with a framework leaking into project.  If you use
 version 2.0 of FooFramework, will a person developing a web
 application in 1.0 of FooFramework be able to use your IDE?

 * Developing web applications using a web-based IDE is probably the
 most obvious use for this, but there's no reason it can't be useful
 for any Python project.

 * There are some significant limitations to what UI you can achieve
 in a web environment.  If you don't have lots of Javascript
 experience, you should probably be pretty conservative in your
 proposal about what you can achieve in the UI.

 * Some of the features are intended to encourage users to use good
 development methodology, especially when they themselves aren't
 familiar with that methodology.  Version control and testing are
 very much part of that.

 * There are existing tools that address many of those features.  For
 instance, there are many testing tools available, and libraries for
 version control.  An IDE is really about making a cohesive
 experience binding those tools.  

 * Describing your vision for what a cohesive experience would really
 look like would be a good strategy for a proposal.

 * Repeating this bullet list in some form in your proposal is not a
 good strategy.  This is more intended as a list of some of the
 challenging aspects of the topic, and some of the open questions.
 A proposal should respond to these issues.
