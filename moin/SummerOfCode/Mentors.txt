== Python Mentors ==
These are the current summer of code 2006 mentors (incomplete still) for the Python Software Foundation and what projects they're interested in seeing.

Mentors are listed in alphabetical order.

=== Simon Belak ===
simon.belak@hruska.si

[http://www.turbogears.org TurboGears] developer.

I am also interested in projects involving AI or WSGI.

=== Ian Bicking ===
ianb@colorstudy.com

Web developer, [http://pythonpaste.org/ Paste], [http://sqlobject.org SQLObject], and a [http://blog.ianbicking.org blog]

I'm interested in web-related projects, particularly infrastructure involving [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ WSGI].  Education-related web projects would also be of interest to me.

=== Janez Demsar ===
janez.demsar@fri.uni-lj.si

I'm one of developers of Orange [http://www.ailab.si], a large machine learning/data mining library for Python. I'd mentor students interested in developing new data mining widgets, adding new machine learning methods to the suite, interfacing it with other Python libraries or applications (like prolog, R, Matlab)...

=== Jim Jewett ===
JimJJewett@gmail.com

 + client-side web projects, particularly improvements to the plucker www.plkr.org distiller.
 + standard library improvements (probably not new modules)
 + access control/capabilities (to allow running untrusted code, or to sandbox for optimizations)

In all cases, well-documented (doctest OK, doesn't need to be LaTex), clean, easily maintained and extended will trump extra functionality.

Standard library 
=== Richard Jones ===
richard@python.org

Developer of [http://roundup.sf.net/ Roundup], [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi PyPI].

I'm interested in projects to improve Roundup or PyPI.



=== Robert Kern ===
robert.kern@enthought.com

I am mostly interested in projects that are of use for scientific development. Specifically, anything to do with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Chaco, Mayavi, Traits, or IPython. More generally, I am also interested in mentoring projects of use to plotting frameworks, like math formula layout using TeX algorithms.


=== Andrew Kuchling ===
amk@amk.ca

I can help mentor improvements to the standard library, some web projects, and documentation projects.


=== Arc Riley ===
[http://www.soya3d.org/ Soya3d] developer from Ithaca, NY.  I've also worked with many free software multimedia systems and web frameworks for Python.

I can mentor one or two Soya3d related projects.


=== Blaz Zupan ===
blaz.zupan@fri.uni-lj.si

Developer of [http://www.ailab.si/orange Orange], a data mining suite with Python scripting and visual programming interface that uses Qt and PyQt.

Interested in development of new data/text mining algorithms, new visualization techniques (including 3D and sterographics for data mining), new Orange data mining widgets, data mining in bioinformatics, and porting Orange to MacOS.
