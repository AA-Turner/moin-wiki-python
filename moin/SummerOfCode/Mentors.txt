== Python Mentors ==
These are the current summer of code 2006 mentors (incomplete still) for the Python Software Foundation and what projects they're interested in seeing.

Mentors are listed in alphabetical order.

=== Facundo Batista ===
facundo@taniquetil.com.ar

I'd love to mentor project regarding the Decimal data type, and anyone where I could help because I speak Spanish.

=== Simon Belak ===
simon.belak@hruska.si

[http://www.turbogears.org TurboGears] developer.

I am also interested in projects involving AI or WSGI.

=== Robert (Rocky) Bernstein ===

Around the beginning of 2006, I've extened pdb.py to be more complete using the gdb command set as a guideline. See [http://bashdb.sf.net/pydb]. I've also written debuggers for [http://bashdb.sf.net/remake GNU make] and [http://bashdb.sf.net GNU Bash]. Areas where pdb (or pydb) should to be extended (such as in a Summer of Code project) are
 * thread debugging
 * debugging from a separate process
 * remote debugging (which should be done as an extension of debugging from a separate process)

I've also written a Python wrapper for my CD input and control library , [http://freshmeat.net/projects/libcdio/?branch_id=62870 libcdio]. Alas libcdio is much larger than what I've wrapped via SWIG so far. In particular missing is an interface to jitter and error correction interface for "Red Book" or audio CD's (libcdparanoia), and an interface for issuing MMC (Multi-Media Commands). I'd love to see someone complete this as a Summer of Code Project.

Some of my other GPL projects include [http://motif-pstree.sf.net xps], [http://ps-watcher.sf.net ps-watcher], [http://rm-old-files.sf.net remove/rename old files], and[http://recycle-logs.sf.net recycle log files] which can be found on [http://freshmeat.net] or [http://sourceforge.net]. I'm the current maintainer of the development branch for [http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager GNU VCDImager] and have wrote the navigable VCD plugin that's part of [http://xinehq.de xine]. 

I am enthusiastic about programming.

=== Ian Bicking ===
ianb@colorstudy.com

Web developer, [http://pythonpaste.org/ Paste], [http://sqlobject.org SQLObject], and a [http://blog.ianbicking.org blog]

I'm interested in web-related projects, particularly infrastructure involving [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ WSGI].  Education-related web projects would also be of interest to me.

=== Carl Bolz ===

=== Buddha Buck ===
blaisepascal@gmail.com

Will mentor one Soya3d-related project.

=== Hye-Shik Chang ===

=== Janez Demsar ===
janez.demsar@fri.uni-lj.si

I'm one of developers of Orange [http://www.ailab.si], a large machine learning/data mining library for Python. I'd mentor students interested in developing new data mining widgets, adding new machine learning methods to the suite, interfacing it with other Python libraries or applications (like prolog, R, Matlab)...

=== Jeremy Hylton ===

Bytecode compiler, AST, program analysis.  Also, blogs, RSS, Atom.


=== Jim Jewett ===
JimJJewett@gmail.com

 * client-side web projects, particularly improvements to the plucker www.plkr.org distiller.
 * standard library improvements (probably not new modules)
 * access control/capabilities (to allow running untrusted code, or to sandbox for optimizations)

In all cases, well-documented (doctest OK, doesn't need to be LaTex), clean, easily maintained and extended will trump extra functionality.

=== Richard Jones ===
richard@python.org

Developer of [http://roundup.sf.net/ Roundup], [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi PyPI].

I'm interested in projects to improve Roundup or PyPI.


=== David Joyner ===
wdj@usna.edu

I'm interested in mentoring a project to 
improve [http://sage.scipy.org SAGE].

=== David Kohel ===
kohel@maths.usyd.edu.au

I am interested in mentoring projects for development of mathematical libraries for (discrete) algebraic structures in Python, particularly those projects which relate to arithmetic of abelian groups, finite rings, and solution of algebraic equations over them, motivated by applications to cryptography. Of particular interest are applications which advance the development of [http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage SAGE].

=== Jonathan LaCour ===
No info posted yet.

=== Jean-Baptiste Lamy ===
jibalamy@free.fr

Maintainer of [http://www.soya3d.org/ Soya3d].  Will mentor one Soya3d-related project.


=== Robert Kern ===
robert.kern@enthought.com

I am mostly interested in projects that are of use for scientific development. Specifically, anything to do with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Chaco, Mayavi, Traits, or IPython. More generally, I am also interested in mentoring projects of use to plotting frameworks, like math formula layout using TeX algorithms.


=== Andrew Kuchling ===
amk@amk.ca

I can help mentor improvements to the standard library, some web projects, and documentation projects.


=== Travis Oliphant ===
oliphant@ee.byu.edu

I am interested in mentoring projects related to NumPy or SciPy.  In particular I would be interested in mentoring a project to extract the essential elements of NumPy into a basic array object for inclusion into Python.  A future NumPy would then inherit from this basic array object.

=== Serge Rey ===
serge@rohan.sdsu.edu

I am interested in mentoring projects applying Python in the areas of Geographic Information Systems/Science (GIS), visualilzation and geocomputation. I direct the [http://regal.sdsu.edu/stars STARS] project which has a number of geocomputational and visualization components that could serve as SOC projects.


=== Arc Riley ===
arc@xiph.org

[http://www.soya3d.org/ Soya3d] developer from Ithaca, NY.  I've also worked with many free software multimedia systems and web frameworks for Python.

I can mentor one or two Soya3d related projects.

=== Armin Rigo ===

=== William Stein ===
wstein@gmail.com

I am interested in any projects related to making Python the best
environment in which to do mathematics research and education. 
Specifically, I'm interested in mentoring a project to 
improve [http://modular.math.washington.edu SAGE].

=== Jon Schull ===
jis@it.rit.edu

I have a few projects in mind that could have significant impact on
the future of both python and the net.

1).  Python in the browser.  Pick up the torch from Thomas Schilz
http://www.thomas-schilz.de/MozPython/downloads/ and make mozilla
scriptable in python.  This would not only create a versatile and
evolving python GUI platform, it would allow such things as...

2).  A server in, or with, each  browser.  I have been working on a
real-time, collaborative wiki/chat system called twowayweb based on
CherryPy and javascript/Ajax.  I dont' want to post the server's address here because it can't handle more than 30 or so simultaneous users...which is the point:  
the right architecture for a system like this is a
distributed peer to peer architecture where more users means more
servers.   This could be achieved in a number of ways but the most
elegant would be a browser plug-in that included a server.    Here
are some references to this  project.
 [http://it.rit.edu/~jis/2way/Finally%20the%20TwoWayWeb%20June28.pdf Finally the TwoWayWeb]
 [http://www.otierney.net/files/twowaywebposter.pdf poster]  

One way to do this would be by  combining jython with 
[http://simile.mit.edu/java-firefox-extension/  java-firefox-extension ]

Which brings me to ...

3).  Ython (streamlined jython python cross-communication).  I'm
currently working on a music visualization project and find myself
using two elegant and simple python-compatible systems that do not
play particularly well together.  Vpython based on cpython, and
JFugue written in Java works well with jython.     What is the most
elegant way to allow a programmer to "just code"  python while
accessing the functionality of the two interpreters?

=== Blaz Zupan ===
blaz.zupan@fri.uni-lj.si

Developer of [http://www.ailab.si/orange Orange], a data mining suite with Python scripting and visual programming interface that uses Qt and PyQt.

Interested in development of new data/text mining algorithms, new visualization techniques (including 3D and sterographics for data mining), new Orange data mining widgets, data mining in bioinformatics, and porting Orange to MacOS.
