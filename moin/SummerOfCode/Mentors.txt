== Python Mentors ==
These are the current summer of code 2006 mentors (incomplete still) for the Python Software Foundation and what projects they're interested in seeing.


=== Arc Riley ===
Soya3d developer from Ithaca, NY.

Top 5 "want to see" applications:
 1. Cal3d per-bone and morph animations in Soya3d
 2. multi-texture support (bump/normals mapping, etc) in Soya3d
 3. verse support for shapes, materials, and animations in Soya3d
 4. revive restricted python
 5. pyrex optimization

I am mostly interested in projects that are of use for scientific development. Specifically, anything to do with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Chaco, Mayavi, Traits, or IPython. More generally, I am also interested in mentoring projects of use to plotting frameworks, like math formula layout using TeX algorithms.
