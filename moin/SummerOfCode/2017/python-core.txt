= About Core Python =

Core Python encompasses projects that affect the core infrastructure, libraries and CPython.

Python is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to get things done quickly and effectively.  In this spirit, our primary project this year is about helping make Python faster!  Python is a language that can be interpreted and implemented in different ways.  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation|reference implementation]] of Python is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython|CPython]], so named because it's written in C.  But it's not the only option!  [[http://pypy.org/|PyPy]] is an implementation of Python written in Python that prides itself on great performance.  [[http://www.jython.org/|Jython]] is a Python implementation that compiles Python code to Java bytecode.  [[http://ironpython.net/|IronPython]] is an implementation of Python for the .NET framework.  And there are others.

= Getting Started =

The website to help you get started in Core Python development is http://pythonmentors.com/.

Since this year's project is focused on performance, you should probably [[http://speed.pypy.org/|Take a look at the PyPy benchmarks]] and the [[https://hg.python.org/benchmarks/|Grand Unified Benchmarks]] -- what can you learn about the performance of python?  Can you run those benchmarks yourself and see if you get similar results?  Try comparing your results to another applicant's and see if you both can learn!
