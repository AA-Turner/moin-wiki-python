This page describes a possible Summer of Code project for a testing infrastructure for PyPI.

'''Contact: Tarek Ziad√© <tarek@ziade.org>'''

PyPI has recently gained a PubSubHubBub interface we can use to trigger events when a new package is uploaded. 

The student work to be done is :

 * compare and chose the best virtual environment for the testing infrastructure we need
 * create a initial collections of clean VMs
 * study tools like systemtap to be able to report what happens on a box
 * create a set of scripts to drive the Virtual Machines (Linux only) :
  * start the VM
  * set up the VM for the tests (firewall, probes, etc.)
  * upload content and run commands over the VM
  * get back the reports
  * perform rollback
 * create a PubSubHubBub daemon
  * trigger the tests for each upload events
  * store the report
 * create a website
  * display the reports
  * create a registry system for people to get reports by emails
