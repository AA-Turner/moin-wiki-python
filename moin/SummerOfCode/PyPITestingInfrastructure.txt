This page describes a possible Summer of Code project for a testing infrastructure for PyPI.

PyPI has recently gained a PubSubHubHub interface we can use to trigger events when a new package is uploaded. 

The student work will consist of creating a series of scripts that know how to start a VM in an environment like EC2, shut down the network so there's no security issues, then perform a series of actions on the package (likely, distutils commands like 'install').

Last, a rollback on the VM is done so its not compromised by the commands, and a report is sent back. The results could contain also a
list of the files that where modified, using probe tools like SystemTap (under linux). The VMs would be first Linux, and then we
would add Windows VMs.

Once this system is done, the student can work on a lightweight website using a framework like Pylons, where PyPI users could register so they get the reports by e-mails. The site could also display the reports.
