== Working on the Official Documentation ==
If you think something should be documented in the main Python docs, but currently isn't, you can either follow these [[https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html|instructions on how to contribute to the Python documentation]] to report the issue or to help fix it. Alternatively, you could add your suggestion to the MissingFromDocumentation page of this Wiki and wait for other people to pick it up and take action.

There are currently only few modules in the standard library that are undocumented. Lists of these modules can be found in the documentation of each Python version:

 * [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/undoc.html|current list for Python 3]]
