Please get a wiki running side-by-side with the documentation: 1 corresponding wikiable page for every page here in the official documentation. The startup data is simply that of the docs, so we just need to mirror their structure. Then after the wiki docs start offering lots of useful information, the actual documentation writers can incorporate this. To summarize, I think Python's documentation (like the library reference) is basically a big melange of API data and some snippets of useful info. This wiki will help replace those places that just use API data to fill up space, and turn it into something better, like the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/ PHP Manual].

 I think that's a great idea. But I think it should appear on a separate wiki. We're going to need to do some steering for this wiki: If every python related project in the world tries to make their wiki a WikiWiki:WalledGarden within ''this'' wiki, we're going to run into problems. RecentChanges will be a total mess of a zillion projects. Let's talk. -- LionKimbro [[DateTime(2003-10-02T03:15:01Z)]]
