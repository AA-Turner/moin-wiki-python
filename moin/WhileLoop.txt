 * When do I use them?

''While'' loops, like the ForLoop, are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a ''for'' loop, the ''while'' loop will not run ''n'' times, but until a defined condition is no longer met. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.

As the ''for'' loop in Python is so powerful, ''while'' is rarely used, except in cases where a user's input is required*, for example:

{{{
n = raw_input("Please enter 'hello':")
while n.strip() != 'hello':
    n = raw_input("Please enter 'hello':")
}}}
However, the problem with the above code is that it's wasteful. In fact, what you will see a lot of in Python is the following:

{{{
while True:
    n = raw_input("Please enter 'hello':")
    if n.strip() == 'hello':
        break
}}}
As you can see, this compacts the whole thing into a piece of code managed entirely by the ''while'' loop. Having ''True'' as a condition ensures that the code runs until it's broken by {{{n.strip()}}} equaling {{{'hello'}}}.

 * Another version you may see of this type of loop uses {{{while 1}}} instead of {{{while True}}}.  In older Python versions ''True'' was not available, but nowadays is preferred for readability.
  * [[https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/2.3.html#optimizations|Starting with Py2.3]], the interpreter optimized {{{while 1}}} to just a single jump.  Using ''1'' was minutely faster, since ''True'' was not a keyword and might have been given a different value, which the interpreter had to look up, as opposed to loading a constant.  As a programmer, it is up to you which style to use - but always remember that readability is important, and that while speed is also important, readability trumps it except in cases where timings are significantly different.
  * [[https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#changed-syntax|Starting in Python 3]], {{{True}}}, {{{False}}}, and {{{None}}} are keywords, so using {{{while 1}}} no longer provides the tiny performance benefit used to justify it in earlier versions.
