=== Brief Bio ===
Working as a software engineer, ''in both contract and permanent roles'', since 1987 but with an interest in computers since the 1970s I have mostly worked designing, developing, maintaining, researching, training & testing in the embedded & safety critical industries including:

 * Flight Simulation ''(PL/M-86/286/489, C, FORTRAN, Assembler)''
 * Telecommunications & Cable TV ''(C++, C, Pascal)''
 * Defense ''(C, C++, Corel-66, FORTRAN, BASIC)'' 
 * Avionics ''(Java, C, XML, XSL, CSS, HTML, Test Scripting, Python, Assembler, Test Scripting)''
 * Sonar ''(Python, C, Pascal, Delphi, PL/M-286, DSP)''
 * Rail Infrastructure ''(C, Assembler)''
 * Oil & Gas ''(Python, Jupyter, C, C++, VB6, Assembler)''

I am familiar with target & development systems ranging from those with no OS (bare metal), through those that need to be booted from paper tape, desktop machines and mainframes - from single chips to pipelines & clusters with 100s of processors. 

I am an occasional conference attendee at PyConUK & EuroPython.
