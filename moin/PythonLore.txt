= Python Lore and Cultural Info =

This page is a collection point for various insider knowledge of the Python community, for compilation into a short, hopefully entertaining screencast for introducing people to the way things happen.

== Terminology ==

Part of that is knowing the terms you often hear on the lists, both what it stands for ''and'' what it means.  I've heard these used as insider comments at past PyCons, with newbies shaking their heads not understanding:

 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It YAGNI] (you ain't gonna need it; yet another great new interface)

 * DRY (don't repeat yourself)

 * TSTTCPW (the simplest thing that could possibly work)

 * (drat - at some previous PyCon someone put up list of such
   acronyms, and I can't remember them)

== Insider Jokes ==

 * Guido's time machine

 * "import this"

 * "from __future__ import braces"
