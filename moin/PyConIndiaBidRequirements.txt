Indian python(istas) across various Indian cities interested in hosting PyCon-India in their city (college or university) can use the following template when they submit advance bids for their cities. Hopefully it will avoid all the list wars and confusion over the host city that we have been having for 2011. 

Please create a new wikipage, example: [[PyConIndiaBidCityName]], copy the questions and answer it, then post the link on the INpycon list for further discussion.
