== Volunteer Opportunities in Python ==

The purpose of this page is to act as an adjunct to the [http://www.python.org/community/jobs/ Python Jobs] page, which only allows the posting of paying jobs.

This page is dedicated to volunteer opportunities that are not necessarily any different from any other "real" job, except for the fact that the work is not done for pay.  There's a separate page with information if you want to [http://www.python.org/psf/volunteer.html volunteer to help the PSF].

=== How To Submit a Volunteer Job ===

There is already a [http://www.python.org/community/jobs/howto/ Python Jobs HowTo] page, and it would be best if you could follow those same instructions as closely as possible for this page.  Doing so will allow people who are already familiar with this site to access the material quickly and easily, and should help increase your chances of getting a suitable volunteer sooner rather than later.

You may have to modify the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html reStructuredText] format for suitable use in MoinMoin.  If so, please adhere as close as you can to the guidelines.

Please review the [http://www.python.org/moin/HelpContents MoinMoin Help] page if you have any questions regarding how to edit this page, how to use wikis, etc....

== Currently Available Volunteer Positions ==

Please put all available positions starting here, the most recent ones first.
'''NO COMMERCIAL JOB POSITIONS PLEASE!''' There is a seperate wiki page for that.


=== BeeSeek: the Open Source Search Engine ===

We are developing an open source search engine based on a peer to peer technology, written in Python.

We are currently looking for skilled Python programmers that enjoys co-working with other people. Experiences in DBMS, XHTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP will be appreciated (although not mandatory). Their duties will be working on the search engine and, occasionally, help with our website (drupal-based) and other services we use.

=== PyConference ===

'''Conference planning web application plus appropriate frontend (conference website).'''

I don't know if you know it, but there is an very good conference planning software written in Ruby on Rails, called "Pentabarf" - http://www.pentabarf.org/Main_Page - and I really would like to see it if we have something like that in python, too.

Its not a "NIH"-thing, but I am more into Python than into Ruby, as the most of you. And a second reason for starting such a project is especially the planning of python-focused confernces. There it would be a little be embarassing, if someone plans a conference in a RoR conference planning web application or - much worser :-) - in PHP.

And using a half-baked Plone or Zope application wouldnt do the job right, also not the using of a wiki like MoinMoin, it isnt the right tool for such a job.

I didn't start the project yet, but if there are enough people for a good team I would start and host it.

Ruby has a good web framework doing this, Ruby on Rails. But we got two! :) If wether Django or Pylons is better is for the job, will be decided based on the peoples who participate, and also if the web app gets more in the content or more in the application/tool direction.

I work with both web frameworks so the decision is mostly based on this. Therefore you guys should have knowledge in these frameworks or feel capable of learn about them. Also only HTML/CSS or Javascript/AJAX-Guys are welcome, also translators etc.

The name is also not decided, if you have a good name with (at best) a Monty Python connection, place it here:
 
 * Booth
  * I put the first one myself: It is the name of John Cleese's (ex)wife and actress in most Monty Python movies and the name fits in the conference context :)
 *

PS: The most important thing - if you want to take part, mail me with subject "PyConference" at: mm ( A-T ) mpathy ( D-O-T ) de

=== [http://www.escreeningroom.org E Screening Room] (San Rafael, CA, USA) ===

'''Job Description:'''  This is not for the faint of heart ! If you have time to hammer this out in the next three weeks let us know… We will be building an integration of “Broadcast Machine” with Paypal subscription services.* 

We are looking for a volunteer web developer with a passion for documentary films and in support of the freedom of speech, with experience with perl, Python mysql. We are using agile (extreme) programming methods. We can’t pay you anything but you get to create the cool feature to support the freedom of speech. 

The non-profit E Screening Room  http://escreeningroom.org/ is dedicated to connect independent documentary film makers with their audience. We have on-line website dedicated to viewing unabridged independent documentary films at http://escreeningroom.org. 
We are starting a new website http://indiewebfest.org which will be an online filmfestival based running on open source “Broadcast Machine” from http://www.getdemocracy.com/broadcast/. The neat thing of the “Broadcast Machine” is that it is bittorrent based, and thus allows for unlimited band wide without significant funding. In effect this means that you don’t have to come up with thousands of $$ to distribute your idea or your film. 

Independent documentary films are born out of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the film. Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose an independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we are changing that by connecting documentary filmmakers with their audience. 

'''Project:''' The idea is to allow viewers to subscribe to a site through paypal. The viewer would pay a low monthly fee to get assess to a subset (subscription only) of the films on the site. The subscription fees are then redistributed to the filmmakers papal accounts based on viewer ship and will fund the site. This project will take place independent of getdemocracy.com but application will be released as open source. I expect that it will take about 40 hour over two months.

=== Video display hooks needed for off--screen model.  ===

As many of you may or may not know, there is a freeware open-source screen reader for blind and visually impaired people written in Python called NVDA (Nonvisual Desktop Access.) The software runs on Windows2000, xp (all versions) and vista. The project is coming along quickly however we need video display hooks to create an off-screen model so that NVDA can give more information to the blind computer user, and also implement such things as mouse simulation. Video display hooks will also allow us to support even more applications and enhance the support of the current applications even more-so. These video display hooks for the offscreen model need to be written in Python if possible. To download NVDA, go to 

http://www.nvda-project.org

We as developers and testers haven't been able to figure out how to implement video display hooks so NVDA can utilise an off-screen model so far. Any help would be greatly appreciated. You may contact me about this project at 
Josh Kennedy
jkenn337@gmail.com 
msn messenger contact: Josh Kennedy     kenn6498ku@hotmail.com
skype contact: jkenn337

Again any assistance with this project would be greatly apreciated. Video display hooks will greatly increase the abilities of the NVDA screen-reader. Note, this position is not restricted to blind programmers if you have sight and can help please contact me. There is also an email list for NVDA at nvda@freelists.org .
