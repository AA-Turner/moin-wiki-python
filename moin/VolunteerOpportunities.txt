== Volunteer Opportunities in Python ==

The purpose of this page is to act as an adjunct to the [http://www.python.org/Jobs.html Python Jobs] page, which only allows the posting of paying jobs.

This page is dedicated to volunteer opportunities that are not necessarily any different from any other "real" job, except for the fact that the work is not done for pay.  There's a separate page with information if you want to [http://www.python.org/psf/volunteer.html volunteer to help the PSF].

=== How To Submit a Volunteer Job ===

There is already a [http://www.python.org/Jobs-howto.html Python Jobs HowTo] page, and it would be best if you could follow those same instructions as closely as possible for this page.  Doing so will allow people who are already familiar with this site to access the material quickly and easily, and should help increase your chances of getting a suitable volunteer sooner rather than later.

You may have to modify the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html reStructuredText] format for suitable use in MoinMoin.  If so, please adhere as close as you can to the guidelines.

Please review the [http://www.python.org/moin/HelpContents MoinMoin Help] page if you have any questions regarding how to edit this page, how to use wikis, etc....

Please put all available positions starting after the following title.
