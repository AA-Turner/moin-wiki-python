Hi! My name is Thomas I've recently started to learn python after learning a considerable amount of Pascal and Delphi. My current interests are PIC programming, website development, computer gaming and sleeping! Currently working on using Arduino & Raspberry PI to make an indoors irrigation system (sweet huh?) and a [[http://www.findcheapholidays.co.uk|cheap holiday]] website.
