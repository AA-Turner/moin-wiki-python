I'm a neuroscientist. I use python for data analysis. I mainly use the matplotlib package. My aim in contributing to this wiki is to assemble a cookbook of bits of python code that I have used to solve problems. Hopefully the wiki format will make it easy for people to find code for particular uses quickly. The pages here are in no particular order.
