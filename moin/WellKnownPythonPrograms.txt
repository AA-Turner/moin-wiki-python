== Systems Management and Administration ==

 * Many GNU/Linux distributions use Python to manage resources and packages:

   - In many programs and components in the Ubuntu distributions (and related services): "Ubuntu prefer the community to contribute work in Python." ([http://www.ubuntu.com/developers/bounties Ubuntu bounties for Python work])

   - Red Hat's up2date tool (the pulsating red dot)

   - [http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/ yum] provides software updates for Fedora and other distributions

   - Red Hat's installer, Anaconda (notice the clever python tie-in on the name).  [http://fedora.redhat.com/projects/anaconda-installer/]

   - Gentoo Linux ''relies'' on Python since the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/ Portage] package management system is written in Python

 * HP Compaq preinstalled Python on a series of computers for some administration tasks

== Historical Python Applications ==

Historically (these have all been rewritten at some point after acquisition):

 * Yahoo Mail started out as 411 mail which was all Python

 * Yahoo Groups started out as egroups which was all Python

 * Microsoft Commerce Server started out as eShop which was all Python (Yes, Microsoft acquired Python-based software!)

 * Google's first crawler was written in Python
