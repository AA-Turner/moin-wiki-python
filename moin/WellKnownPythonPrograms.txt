== Systems Management and Administration ==

 * Many GNU/Linux distributions use Python to manage resources and packages:
   * In many programs and components in the Ubuntu distributions (and related services): "Ubuntu prefer the community to contribute work in Python." ([http://www.ubuntu.com/community/developerzone/bounties Ubuntu bounties for Python work])
   * Red Hat's up2date tool (the pulsating red dot)
   * [http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/ yum] provides software updates for Fedora and other distributions
   * [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock mock] and [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Plague plague] controls the building of the packages in the Fedora operating system.
   * Fedora and Red Hat's installer, [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda Anaconda] (notice the clever python tie-in on the name).  
   * Gentoo Linux ''relies'' on Python since the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/ Portage] package management system is written in Python
 * HP Compaq / IBM preinstalled Python on a series of computers for some administration tasks

== Historical Python Applications ==

Historically (these have all been rewritten at some point after acquisition):

 * Yahoo Mail started out as 411 mail which was all Python
