=== PyCon Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions ===

BOFs will be held between 8pm and 11pm on Wednesday and Thursday (March 24 and 25).
We currently have two rooms allocated for BOFs.  If there is a lot of demand, we can add another room.

If you want to sign up for a BOF, add a WikiName to one of the tables above.  You can put any information you want about the BOF on the new Wiki page.  Please include your name and email address so that potentially attendees can contact you, and subscribe to this Wiki page so you can keep track of changes.

suggestion: SciPyBoF (Numeric/Numarray)

If there are conflicts, send me mail [mailto:jeremy@alum.mit.edu Jeremy Hylton].  I'll try to mediate or find an extra room.
