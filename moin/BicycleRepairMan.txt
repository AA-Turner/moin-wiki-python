The Python RefactoringBrowser, helping Pythonistas everywhere glide over the gory details of refactoring their code. Watch him extract jumbled code into well ordered classes. Gasp, as he renames all occurrences of a method. Thank You Bicycle Repair Man!

BicycleRepairMan has been designed to integrate easily with your favourite editor or IDE. Integration currently exists for Emacs/XEmacs and IDLE. Vim integration is on the way (and may be finished by the time you read this).
In addition to refactoring, BicycleRepairMan provides query support over your code, and can do things like 'find all uses of this method'.
