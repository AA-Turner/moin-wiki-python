The Python Wiki:RefactoringBrowser, helping Pythonistas everywhere glide over the gory details of refactoring their code. Watch him extract jumbled code into well ordered classes. Gasp, as he renames all occurrences of a method. Thank You Bicycle Repair Man!

BicycleRepairMan has been designed to integrate easily with your favourite editor or IDE. Integration currently exists for Emacs/XEmacs, IDLE, Eric3 and Vim.

In addition to refactoring, BicycleRepairMan provides support for doing queries on your code - e.g. 'find all uses of this method'.

["lwickjr"]: I've downloaded and installed BicycleRepairMan, and I really like it, but I've had problems with several bugs. I've fixed some of them, and side-stepped others, but I don't know enough about the internals to do much more. Would PhillDaws __please__ post a contact link on my page? I'd like to discuss this with him.
