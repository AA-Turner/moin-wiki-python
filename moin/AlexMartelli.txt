[stolen from the c2 wiki:]

Opinionated, particularly on subjects I love (bridge, software design, William Blake, BDSM, history, economics, ...), rather competent, often helpful, often given to flaming.  Searching deja.com for the thousands of usenet posts I've made over the years will give an accurate picture of me (in particular, it will be accurately complex and contradictory), but you may also want to see http://www.magenta.com/~alex and/or http://aleax.supereva.it.

Current interests include C++, COM, Python, XP, Win2000, Linux, several bridge issues (Kaplan-Sheinwold, Moscito, statistical and combinatorial analysis of bridge-related issues, ...), some BDSM ones (spanking first and foremost), a few historical ones (late Roman Republic most of all), some international politics issue (care to bet which country will break up next?), and more.  My current job, however, is about bringing 3D to the masses (http://www.think3.com).
