Opinionated, particularly on subjects I love (bridge, software design, William Blake, BDSM, history, economics, ...), rather competent, often helpful, often given to flaming.  Searching deja.com for the thousands of usenet posts I've made over the years will give an accurate picture of me (in particular, it will be accurately complex and contradictory), but you may also want to see http://www.aleax.it (in Italian).

Current interests include Python, Agile Programming, Design Patterns, Linux, several bridge issues (Kaplan-Sheinwold, card play, statistical and combinatorial analysis of bridge-related issues, ...), some BDSM ones (spanking first and foremost), a few historical ones (late Roman Republic most of all), some current economics issues (care to bet on the durability of the mostly-stationary, up-and-down doldrums we're going through?), high-quality movies, and more.

I currently work mostly for AB Strakt (http://www.strakt.com/).  Feel free to write me at alex@strakt.com !
