Opinionated, particularly on subjects I love (bridge, software design, William Blake, BDSM, history, economics, ...), rather competent, often helpful, often given to flaming.  Searching Google Groups for the thousands of usenet posts I've made over the years will give an accurate picture of me (in particular, it will be bafflingly complex and contradictory), but you may also want to see http://www.aleax.it (in Italian) -- it's been quite a while since I last edited that, but, that might change.

Current interests include Python, Agile Programming, Design Patterns, OpenBSD, Linux, several bridge issues (Kaplan-Sheinwold, card play, statistical and combinatorial analysis of bridge-related issues, ...), some BDSM ones (spanking first and foremost), a few historical ones (late Roman Republic most of all), some current economics issues (care to bet on the durability of the mostly-stationary, up-and-down doldrums we're going through?), high-quality movies, and more.

I currently work mostly for AB Strakt (http://www.strakt.com/).  On the AB Strakt site you'll also find copies of several Python-related articles and presentations I've written.  Feel free to write me at alex@strakt.com !  The Python books I've written for O'Reilly are available online as part of O'Reilly's "Safari" service -- subscribing to Safari costs money, but the first two weeks are free, so, I suggest you give it a try, as a cheap but convenient way to read my books:-).
