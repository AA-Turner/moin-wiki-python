'''Security'''

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 (May 10, building 41)reception.

'''Parking'''

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

'''Logistics'''
 * We will be putting up signs to help you get to Building 43 reception.
 * We are making arrangements to have the meetings videotaped.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.
