The september meeting is an Overview of Developing a Python Product,
by Mike Pittaro of SnapLogic.


'''Security'''

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 reception.

'''Parking'''

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

'''Logistics'''
 * All meetings are videotaped and made available on Google Video or YouTube.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.

/!\ This page gets edited frequently.  A number of us scan all the wiki updates looking for spam.  It would make our job a bit easier if you were logged in when you edited the page.  The update email address subject would contain enough information for us to conclude that the edit was okay without actually having to open the message.  -- SkipMontanaro

= October 11 meeting =
Just wanted to say hi to the BayPiggies and note that AlexanderSchremmer and ThomasWaldmann (both MoinMoin core developers) would like to visit you at this meeting. Either to hear about some interesting talk you already scheduled or maybe to talk about MoinMoin wiki, if you are interested. I have subscribed to this page, so we can discuss here, if that's ok.
