=== Overview ===
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM  Please try to get to Bldg. 43 sign-in desk by 7:20 as there may be a line to sign in.
 * Place: Google Main Engineering Campus, Building 43, Tunis Tech Talk (2nd Flr)
 * Directions to Google: http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html#directions

'''Location Change'''
The October meeting will be held in Seville Tech Talk in Building 40.  Please plan to pick up your badge/sign-in at Building 41 reception.


=== Security ===

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 reception.

=== Parking ===

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

=== Logistics ===
 * All meetings are videotaped and made available on Google Video or YouTube.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.
 * Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending.  An example has been provided.
