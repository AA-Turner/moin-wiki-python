'''''BayPiggies Meetings at Google'''''

BayPiggies will hold meetings at Google on the second Thursday of each month.  This wiki page is a communication tool for visitors to Google for these meetings.  If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the attendee list for each applicable date.

'''NOTE'''

Our usual room in Building 43 is not available for the April 12 meeting, so we'll be convening in Pretoria Tech Talk (2nd Flr, Building 44).  Building 44 is directly across the street from the main campus, at 1565 Charleston Rd.

'''Overview'''
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM  Please try to get to Bldg. 43 (or 44) sign-in desk by 7:20 as there may be a line to sign in.

Newbies Night Presentation(s)

Speakers, Alex Martelli, (maybe more)

Alex will give the first half of his presentation. There will be time for questions afterward. This is intended for people who are experienced as programmers but not experienced in Python.

'''Security'''

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 reception.

'''Parking'''

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

'''Logistics'''
 * We will be putting up signs to help you get to Building 43 reception.
 * We are making arrangements to have the meetings videotaped.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.
