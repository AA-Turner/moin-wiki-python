'''Program'''
 

    Feb. 08:
    7:30 - 8:50pm Technical Program

7:35pm

Topic: Three Generations of User Interface

Speaker: Dennis Reinhardt

Materials: http://www.spamai.com/present/ (after presentation)
About the talk

I have implemented DialogDevil via three different user interfaces:

   1. direct to Windows API via ctypes
   2. wxPython, and
   3. separate embedded html-based process.

The pros and cons of each approach from a developer's perspective will be discussed using metrics such as memory footprint, download size, flexibility, robustness, and visual styling.

8:00pm

Topic: Visualizing python profile results

Speaker: Drew Perttula
About the talk

I'll present a simple development tool that reads results from the python profiler and renders them into a web page. The page uses colored bars and tinted table cells to highlight additional information about the profile results.
About the speaker

In past Baypiggies meetings, Drew has presented a video editor, an intro to pyrex, and a theater lighting control system. Currently, he spends most of his time working on films with ogres and princesses and on a web game startup.

8:25pm

Topic: Introduction to wxPython

'''Security'''

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 reception.

'''Parking'''

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

'''Logistics'''
 * We will be putting up signs to help you get to Building 43 reception.
 * We are making arrangements to have the meetings videotaped.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.

The update email address subject would contain enough information for us to conclude that the edit was okay without actually having to open the message.  -- SkipMontanaro
