= BayPiggies Meetings at Google =

BayPiggies will hold meetings at Google on the second Thursday of each month.  This wiki page is a communication tool for visitors to Google for these meetings.  If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the attendee list for each applicable date.

Details here:
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/baypiggies/2007-October/002608.html

(The date in the email says 10/9, which is incorrect. The correct date is 10/11/07)


=== Overview ===
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM  Please try to get to Bldg. 43 sign-in desk by 7:20 as there may be a line to sign in.
 * Place: Google Main Engineering Campus, Building 43, Tunis Tech Talk (2nd Flr)
 * Directions to Google: http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html#directions

'''Location Change'''
The October meeting will be held in Seville Tech Talk in Building 40.  Please plan to pick up your badge/sign-in at Building 41 reception.


=== Security ===

Please inform 'gate' security that you are a visitor for the BayPiggies Python Users Group Meeting.  If you get a funny look, let them know that you are a guest of Leslie Hawthorn and that you will be checking in with security at Building 43 reception.

=== Parking ===

Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

=== Logistics ===
 * All meetings are videotaped and made available on Google Video or YouTube.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.
 * Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending.  An example has been provided.

= October 11 meeting =

Just wanted to say hi to the BayPiggies and note that AlexanderSchremmer and ThomasWaldmann (both MoinMoin core developers) would like to visit you at this meeting. Either to hear about some interesting talk you already scheduled or maybe to talk about MoinMoin wiki, if you are interested. I have subscribed to this page, so we can discuss here, if that's ok.
