= BayPiggies Meetings at Google =
BayPiggies will hold meetings at Google on the second Thursday of each month.  This wiki page is a communication tool for visitors to Google for these meetings.  If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the attendee list for each applicable date.

=== Overview ===
 * Time: 7:30 - 9 PM  Please try to get to Bldg. 40 sign-in desk by 7:20 as there may be a line to sign in.
 * Place: Google Main Engineering Campus, Building 40, Seville (2nd floor)
  * (But on March 20th the meeting room will be Tunis. 2nd floor of bldg. 43. Please check in at the bldg. 43 lobby.)
 * Directions to Google: http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html#directions
=== Security ===
There will be security officers in the lobby as well as near the room to direct you to the correct room. There are also security officers wandering around the campus if you get lost.

Gate security is only there if there are special events. If there is a guard gate please inform him that you are here for a meeting and you will be checking in at the lobby.

=== Parking ===
Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is fair game.  Help yourself.

=== Logistics ===
 * All meetings are videotaped and made available on Google Video or YouTube.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to the meeting room.
 * Rides: If you need a ride or can offer one to a fellow attendee, please include your details at the end of the registration list for the meeting you will be attending.  An example has been provided.
