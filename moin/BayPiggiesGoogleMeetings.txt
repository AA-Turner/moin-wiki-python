Any unoccupied parking space outside our underground garage is free game.  Help yourself.

'''Logistics'''
 * We will be putting up signs to help you get to Building 43 reception.
 * We are making arrangements to have the meetings videotaped.
 * You will be pre-registered for the event provided you add yourself to the attendee list below. Pre-registration means that a visitor badge will be available for you upon arrival and you will not need to go through the usual vistor registration process.
 * If you do not pre-register, you will be able to do so on-site at reception, but it will cause some delay for you.  (Note: Much better to pre-register and not show than to not pre-register.)
 * Google Security will escort you from reception to Tunis.
