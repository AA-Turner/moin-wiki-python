''' (!) Next Python Bug Day: November 20th and 21st'''

Time: all weekend

Participants may be around at any time, we expect at a minimum people
from all US continental timezones, France, and Germany.  Most likely
there will be others as well.

Join us for an effort at closing some Python bugs and patches.
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes,
or learn how to submit and examine patches.

##RDM20101116: uncomment the following at start of weekend.
##How are we doing?  Try a [[http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40columns=title&%40columns=id&activity=from+2010-11-20+to+2010-11-21&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&%40group=priority&status=2&%40columns=status&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40action=search|Roundup search for bugs closed over the weekend]].

= Participating at Your User Group =

Some Python user groups will meet up in person during the weekend.

##The organizers suggest Saturday as the day for PUGs to meet up in person, 
##with Sunday geared more
##towards an online collaboration day via IRC, where we can take care
##of all the little things that got in our way of coding on Saturday
##(like finalising/preparing/reviewing patches, updating tracker and
##documentation, writing tests ;-).
##
Is your local user group participating?

  * Add your group here!

= Participating Online =

Participants will meet in the #python-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for 
various platforms, see http://www.irchelp.org.

= Finding Bugs =

Using [[http://bugs.python.org|the bug tracker]], you can perform various searches to look for
candidate issues:

 * [[http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=6&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search|Bugs classified as 'easy']]
 * [[http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=4&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search|Documentation bugs]]

##RDM20101116 The below page is currently empty
##There are various things MissingFromDocumentation; these tasks mostly require writing and editing, not programming.

##The [[http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/StudentPage|task list for GHOP]] contains many small projects of reasonable difficulty. 

= Procedures =

The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in [[http://bugs.python.org/|the Python bug tracker]], trying to 
fix and close issues.
## RDM20101116 PEP 0003 is too out of date to be useful.
## Bugs should be processed in the fashion described by PEP PEP:0003, "Guidelines for Handling Bug Reports".

At PyCon 2008, Brett Cannon provided a
[[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~drifty/pycon/sprint_tutorial.pdf|slideshow educating new contributors]] to the Python code.

Brian Curtin has written a 
[[http://docs.pythonsprints.com/core_development/beginners.html|Beginners Guide to Core Development]].

What to do:

   * Grab a copy of the Python SVN trunk.  See [[http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#version-control|the development FAQ]] for instructions.  If anonymous access isn't working, you can download a snapshot
   from [[http://svn.python.org/snapshots/|the daily snapshot directory]].
   * See also [[http://www.python.org/dev/setup|Getting Set Up]] and [[http://www.python.org/dev/workflow|Issue Workflow]].

   * If you have a problem that isn't in the bug tracker, announce it to the IRC channel, and if it's more than five minutes' work, create a bug report for it.  See the [[http://docs.python.org/dev/bugs.html|bug reporting instructions]] to learn
   how to write bug reports.
   * When you choose a bug to work on, announce it to the IRC channel.  (e.g. "I'm
   working on #123456.")  This avoids accidentally duplicating work.
   * Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem, or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug.   Please see the [[http://www.python.org/dev/patches/|patch submission guidelines]] before submitting a patch.
   * Does the bug appear to be gone in the Python 3.x trunk, but not the 3.1 or 2.7 maintenance branchs?  Report that, too.
   * If someone else has supplied a fix, see if this fix works for
   you, and add your results to the bug.
   * Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality.
   This is usually the most time-consuming step in the bug fixing process, so reading patches
   is very useful.
   * If there's a working fix, feel free to add a note asking for
   the fix to go into SVN. The bug tracker has a lot of items in it, and it's easy for bugs to be overlooked.
   * Feature requests should be classified as type 'feature request' in the bug tracker.

= For later committing =

   * [add notes here as needed]

= Bug days for other projects =

The [[http://dev.zope.org/CVS/BugDays|Zope bug day]] has a good description of what to do, though the details of the bug tracker are specific to the Zope project.

The GNOME community holds regular Bug Days; the procedures are described in [[http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/triage/faq.html|their FAQ]].

= Preparatory Tasks =

 * Need to set up log of python-dev channel
 * Send announcements (python-announce, python-dev, PSF weblog, personal web log.  python-list?)
