'''Global Python Sprint Weekend: Saturday, May 10-11, 2008'''

Time: all day.
Participants are most likely to be around between 9AM to 3PM according to their local time.

Join us for an effort at closing some Python bugs and patches.
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes,
or learn how to submit and examine patches.

How are we doing?  Try a [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=from+2008-05-10+to+2008-05-12&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=&versions=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=2&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Roundup search for bugs closed over the weekend].  

Upcoming sprint weekends: May 10-11 (a few days after 2.6alpha3 and 3.0alpha5 are scheduled for release), and June 21st-22nd (about a week before 2.6beta2 and 3.0beta2 are released)

= Participating at Your User Group =

Some Python user groups will meet up in person during the weekend.

The organizers suggest Saturday as the day for PUGs to meet up in person, 
with Sunday geared more
towards an online collaboration day via IRC, where we can take care
of all the little things that got in our way of coding on Saturday
(like finalising/preparing/reviewing patches, updating tracker and
documentation, writing tests ;-).

Is your local user group participating?

= Participating Online =

Participants will meet in the #python-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for 
various platforms, see http://www.irchelp.org.

= Finding Bugs =

Using [http://bugs.python.org the bug tracker], you can perform various searches to look for
candidate issues:

 * [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=6&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Bugs classified as 'easy']
 * [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=4&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Documentation bugs]

There are various things MissingFromDocumentation; these tasks mostly require writing and editing, not programming.

The [http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/StudentPage task list for GHOP] contains many small projects of reasonable difficulty. 

= Procedures =

The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in [http://bugs.python.org/ the Python bug tracker], trying to 
fix and close issues.
Bugs should be processed in the fashion described by PEP PEP:0003, "Guidelines for Handling Bug Reports".

At PyCon 2008, Brett Cannon provided a
[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~drifty/pycon/sprint_tutorial.pdf slideshow educating new contributors] to the Python code.

What to do:

   * Grab a copy of the Python 2.6 SVN tree.  See [http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn the development FAQ] for instructions.  If anonymous access isn't working, you can download a snapshot
   from [http://svn.python.org/snapshots/ the daily snapshot directory].

   * If you have a problem that isn't in the bug tracker, announce it to the IRC channel, and if it's more than five minutes' work, create a bug report for it.  See the [http://docs.python.org/dev/bugs.html bug reporting instructions] to learn
   how to write bug reports.
   * When you choose a bug to work on, announce it to the IRC channel.  (e.g. "I'm
   working on #123456.")  This avoids accidentally duplicating work.
   * Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem, or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug.   Please see the [http://www.python.org/dev/patches/ patch submission guidelines] before submitting a patch.
   * Does the bug appear to be gone in the Python 2.6 trunk, but not the 2.5 maintenance branch?  Report that, too.
   * If someone else has supplied a fix, see if this fix works for
   you, and add your results to the bug.
   * Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality.
   This is usually the most time-consuming step in the bug fixing process, so reading patches
   is very useful.
   * If there's a working fix, feel free to add a note asking for
   the fix to go into SVN. The bug tracker has a lot of items in it, and it's easy for bugs to be overlooked.
   * Feature requests can be added to the text of PEP PEP:0042
   or classified as type 'feature request' in the bug tracker.

= For later committing =

SF:1222 (need to test on non-MacOS, non-Mandriva, non-Debian platform)

SF:1204 (needs up-to-date autoconf)

= Questions? =

If you have questions about the bug day, please add them to this section.

= Bug days for other projects =

The [http://dev.zope.org/CVS/BugDays Zope bug day] has a good description of what to do, though the details of the bug tracker are specific to the Zope project.

The GNOME community holds regular Bug Days; the procedures are described in [http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/triage/faq.html their FAQ].

= Preparatory Tasks =

 * Need to set up log of python-dev channel
 * Send announcements (python-announce, python-dev, PSF weblog, personal web log.  python-list?)
