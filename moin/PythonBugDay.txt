The release of Python 2.4alpha1 is currently scheduled for around July 1st.  An organized effort to go through the bug database and close irrelevant bugs or apply fixes would be very useful.

= Schedule =

The bug day will be on Saturday, June 5, 2004, from 9AM to 9PM EDT (1PM to 1AM GMT).

Participants will convene in the #python-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for various platforms, see http://www.irchelp.org.

= Procedures =

The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 the Python bug tracker] on SourceForge, providing additional information so that the bug can be fixed and closed.
Bugs should be processed in the fashion described by [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0003.html PEP 3].

What to do:

   * If a problem isn't logged on SF, log it.  See the    
   [http://docs.python.org/lib/reporting-bugs.html bug reporting instructions] to learn
   how to write bug reports.
   * When you choose a bug to work on, announce it to the IRC channel.  (e.g. "I'm 
   working on #123456.")
   * Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem,
   or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug.   Does the bug appear to be 
   gone in Python 2.3.4 or 2.4 CVS?  Report that, too.
   * If someone else has supplied a fix, see if this fix works for
   you, and post your results to the bug.
   * Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality.
   This is usually the most time-consuming step in the bug fixing process, so reading patches
   is very useful.
   * If there's a working fix, feel free to add a note asking for
   the fix to go into CVS. The SF bug tracker for Python has a lot of bugs in it, and it's easy for bugs to be overlooked.
   * Feature requests can be added to the text of [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0042.html PEP 42] and the bug closed.

= To Do =

 * Set up [http://cvs.ilrt.org/cvsweb/redland/logger/ logger bot]

= Other bug days =

The [http://dev.zope.org/CVS/BugDays Zope bug day] has a good description of what to do, though the details of the bug tracker are specific to the Zope project.

The GNOME community holds regular Bug Days; the procedures are described in [http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/triage/faq.html their FAQ].
