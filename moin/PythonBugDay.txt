'''No bug day is currently scheduled.'''

It's always time for a push at closing some Python bugs and patches.  

When a new bug day is planned, announcements will be sent to the python-dev and python-list mailing lists.

= Last bug day =

Date: Friday, March 31st 2006.

Time: roughly 9AM to 4PM Eastern (1PM to 8PM GMT) (although the IRC channel won't close at any time ;-) ) 

People on the US West Coast may want to show up from 9AM to 3PM Pacific time (12PM to 6PM Eastern), because it'll be more convenient.

IRC log: ["/IrcLog-2006-03-31"]

= Location =

Participants will convene in the #python-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for various platforms, see http://www.irchelp.org.

The list of bugs currently being worked on is recorded in the Wiki, on the PythonBugDayStatus page.

= Procedures =

The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470&atid=105470 the Python bug tracker] on SourceForge, providing additional information so that the bug can be fixed and closed.
Bugs should be processed in the fashion described by [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0003.html PEP 3].

What to do:

   * Grab a copy of the Python 2.5 SVN tree.  See [http://www.python.org/dev/devfaq.html#subversion-svn the development FAQ] for instructions.  If anonymous access isn't working, you can download a snapshot
   from [http://svn.python.org/snapshots/python/python/ the daily snapshot directory].
   
   * If you have a problem that isn't logged on SF, announce it to the IRC channel, and if it's more than five minutes' work, create a bug report for it.  See the    
   [http://docs.python.org/lib/reporting-bugs.html bug reporting instructions] to learn
   how to write bug reports.
   * When you choose a bug to work on, announce it to the IRC channel.  (e.g. "I'm 
   working on #123456.")
   * Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem,
   or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug.   Does the bug appear to be 
   gone in Python 2.4.2 or 2.5 SVN?  Report that, too.
   * If someone else has supplied a fix, see if this fix works for
   you, and add your results to the bug.
   * Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality.
   This is usually the most time-consuming step in the bug fixing process, so reading patches
   is very useful.
   * If there's a working fix, feel free to add a note asking for
   the fix to go into SVN. The SF bug tracker for Python has a lot of bugs in it, and it's easy for bugs to be overlooked.
   * Feature requests can be added to the text of [http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0042.html PEP 42] 
   or moved to the RFE tracker.

= Questions? =

If you have questions about the bug day, please add them to this section.

   * Does anyone have a Win32 binary of the current svn snapshot? I'd like to help with stdlib bugs, but I don't have a compiler to build the source tree myself.
     * There is one kindly contributed by Alexander Schremmer at http://moin.pocoo.org/Python25a. Thanks!

= Previous bug days =

The first bug day was held Saturday, June 5, 2004, from 9AM to 6PM EDT, ending early because SourceForge CVS stopped working.  30 bugs were closed, and 14 more bugs had enough work done to make them closable.

The second bug day was held July 10 2004.  18 bugs and 21 patches were closed.

The third bug day was Saturday, August 7th. 19 bugs and 12 patches were closed.

The fourth bug day was held Saturday, November 7th. 12 bugs and 10 patches were closed.

The fifth bug day was held Saturday, June 25th 2005. The bug day was ill-fated, as SourceForge was down at the beginning,
the weather was hot around the world and the EuroPython conference took place on the same day. Nevertheless, 10 bugs and 7 patches were closed.

The sixth bug day was held Sunday, December 4th 2005. 11 bugs and patches were closed.

The seventh bug day was held Friday, March 31st 2006. 19 bugs and 9 patches (which were mostly submitted at the bug day itself) were closed.

= Bug days for other projects =

The [http://dev.zope.org/CVS/BugDays Zope bug day] has a good description of what to do, though the details of the bug tracker are specific to the Zope project.

The GNOME community holds regular Bug Days; the procedures are described in [http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/triage/faq.html their FAQ].
