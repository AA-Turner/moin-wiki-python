'''Next Bug Day: Saturday, February 23, 2008'''

Time: all day.
Participants are most likely to be around between 9AM to 3PM according to their local time.

Join us on IRC for an effort at closing some Python bugs and patches.
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes,
or learn how to submit and examine patches.

How are we doing?  Try a [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=2008-02-23&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=2&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Roundup search for bugs closed during the bug day].


= Location =

Participants will meet in the #python-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for various platforms, see http://www.irchelp.org.

= Finding Bugs =

Using [http://bugs.python.org the bug tracker], you can perform various searches to look for
candidate issues:

 * [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=6&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Bugs classified as 'easy']
 * [http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=&type=&components=4&versions=&severity=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search Documentation bugs]

There are various things MissingFromDocumentation; these tasks mostly require writing and editing, not programming.

The [http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/StudentPage task list for GHOP] contains many small projects of reasonable difficulty. 

= Procedures =

The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in [http://bugs.python.org/ the Python bug tracker], trying to 
fix and close issues.
Bugs should be processed in the fashion described by PEP PEP:0003, "Guidelines for Handling Bug Reports".

What to do:

   * Grab a copy of the Python 2.6 SVN tree.  See [http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn the development FAQ] for instructions.  If anonymous access isn't working, you can download a snapshot
   from [http://svn.python.org/snapshots/ the daily snapshot directory].

   * If you have a problem that isn't in the bug tracker, announce it to the IRC channel, and if it's more than five minutes' work, create a bug report for it.  See the [http://docs.python.org/dev/bugs.html bug reporting instructions] to learn
   how to write bug reports.
   * When you choose a bug to work on, announce it to the IRC channel.  (e.g. "I'm
   working on #123456.")  This avoids accidentally duplicating work.
   * Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem, or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug.   Please see the [http://www.python.org/dev/patches/ patch submission guidelines] before submitting a patch.
   * Does the bug appear to be gone in the Python 2.6 trunk, but not the 2.5 maintenance branch?  Report that, too.
   * If someone else has supplied a fix, see if this fix works for
   you, and add your results to the bug.
   * Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality.
   This is usually the most time-consuming step in the bug fixing process, so reading patches
   is very useful.
   * If there's a working fix, feel free to add a note asking for
   the fix to go into SVN. The bug tracker has a lot of items in it, and it's easy for bugs to be overlooked.
   * Feature requests can be added to the text of PEP PEP:0042
   or classified as type 'feature request' in the bug tracker.

= Bug days for other projects =

The [http://dev.zope.org/CVS/BugDays Zope bug day] has a good description of what to do, though the details of the bug tracker are specific to the Zope project.

The GNOME community holds regular Bug Days; the procedures are described in [http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/triage/faq.html their FAQ].

= Preparatory Tasks =

 * Need to set up log of python-dev channel
 * Send announcements (python-announce, python-dev, PSF weblog, personal web log.  python-list?)
