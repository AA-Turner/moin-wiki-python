==== Comments ====
Durus is a persistent object system for applications written in the Python programming language. Durus offers an easy way to use and maintain a consistent collection of object instances used by one or more processes. Access and change of a persistent instances is managed through a cached Connection instance which includes commit() and abort() methods so that changes are transactional. 
==== Programming Model ====
The programming interface is nearly the same as ZODB (Durus is heavily influenced by the ZODB design). Durus aggressively caches data and does not do locking. As a result it performs very well for applications do mostly reading and only a little writing. See the [[http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/doc/FAQ.html|FAQ]]
