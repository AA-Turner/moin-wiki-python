== Potential plans for the EmailSigSprint ==

Here are some things we could do during an email sprint.  I'm not sure whether there is 4 days worth of work here, or just two.

 * Design the API for email v3.0

 * Implementation of email 3.0 changes

 * Fix references to codecs (i.e. CJKCodecs issue)

 * Design and implement a new parser

 * Implement support for more RFCs

 * Write a suite of email address validators that doesn't depend on rfc822.py and is more consistent with RFC 2822.

 * Other topics?
