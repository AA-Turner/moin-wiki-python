Pyjamas-Desktop is a cross-platform framework and applications widget set, based on [http://webkit.org WebKit].  PyWebkitGtk is currently the basis for Pyjamas-Desktop, and it is conceivable that there will exist a PyWebkitQt4, and Pyjamas-Desktop will run on top of that, as well.  PyjamasDesktop is similar to [http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi KiWi] in that it provides an easy-to-use API, where you need not know - at all - that you are running PyGTK underneath.

PyjamasDesktop is actually a port of [http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas PyJamas] which is a web toolkit, so you also have the option of running PyjamasDesktop applications as web applications - unmodified.

The [PyJamas] Widget set is exceptionally comprehensive and yet is easy to use, providing:

 * Simple, Horizontal, Vertical, Docking, Decking, Popup, Stack, Tab, Grid, Flow, Table and HTML Panels
 * Text Labels and HTML including full CSS Stylesheet support and full CSS properties
 * Input, Password and Textarea input boxes
 * List drop-downs including Multi-selection
 * Buttons, Checkboxes and Radio-Buttons including groups.
 * Form Submit Panel (providing file upload).
 * Treeview, Menu and Menubar (vertical and horizontal).

Additional features, thanks to the underlying use of webkit, include:

 * Full CSS Stylesheet functionality, both local, remote and direct and simple API manipulation.
 * Option of executing javascript, for full and complete manipulation of the application.
 * Loading of complete HTML Pages, both local and remote; full URL support.
 * Plugin support for multimedia plugins such as Flash (obsoleting the need for gtk-mozplugin)
 * Access to XML, XSLT and AJAX.
 * (Future: full SVG Canvas support, like HippoCanvas)

It's specifically worth noting that due to PyjamasDesktop's history, it purely provides the "V" in "MVC" applications design, and that one option presently in use is the JSONRPC proxy client included, for communicating with the "MC" in the back-end of your application.  In this way, the same application front-end source code can be compiled with [Pyjamas] - with no modifications - to run on exactly the same back-end HTTP server.
