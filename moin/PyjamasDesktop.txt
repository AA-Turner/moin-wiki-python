Pyjamas-Desktop is a cross-platform framework and applications widget set, based on [http://webkit.org WebKit].  PyWebkitGtk is currently the basis for Pyjamas-Desktop, and it is conceivable that there will exist a PyWebkitQt4, and Pyjamas-Desktop will run on top of that, as well.  PyjamasDesktop is similar to [http://www.async.com.br/projects/kiwi KiWi] in that it provides an easy-to-use API, where you need not know - at all - that you are running PyGTK underneath.

PyjamasDesktop is actually a port of [http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas PyJamas] which is a web toolkit, so you also have the option of running PyjamasDesktop applications as web applications - unmodified.

The [PyJamas] Widget set is exceptionally comprehensive and yet is easy to use, providing:

 * Simple, Horizontal, Vertical, Docking, Flow and HTML Panels
 * Text Labels and HTML including full CSS Stylesheet support and full CSS properties
 * Text, Password and TextArea input boxes
 * List drop-downs including Multi-selection
 * Buttons, Checkboxes and Radio-Buttons including groups.
 * TreeView and Form Submit Panel (including file upload).

Additional features, thanks to the underlying use of webkit, include:

 * Full CSS Stylesheet functionality
 * Option of executing javascript, to manipulate the application widgets
 * Loading of complete HTML Pages, both local and remote
 * Plugin support for multimedia plugins such as Flash.
 * Access to XML, XSLT and AJAX.
 * (Future: full SVG Canvas support, like HippoCanvas)
