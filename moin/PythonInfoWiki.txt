== Send Mail Feature ==

Can we disable the "send mail" feature? I never want to send mail, I always forget to uncheck.

It's the 21 century.  Syndication formats are well enough used in the programming community that email notes is superfluous.

''Untrue. Many of the pydotorg maintainers rely on the email notifications to watch out for spam. Others just use it to keep updated on a couple of pages. I, for example, am subscribed to my homepage.'' -- JohannesGijsbers

== Aesthetics ==

I think the most important thing, at this point, is to make this nicer.

Recommendations:

 * Edit icons and Search box take way too much space right now, at the top of the page -- put them on one line, and hide them away in the top-right corner. If possible, make the icons text, instead of icons?
 * "Toggle Line Numbers" draws way too much attention to itself; ''Especially'' when you have only 2 or 3 lines of code! Remove it entirely, or make it much smaller, or (whatever.)
 * Bullet point items are spread too far apart. Less white space above and below them.
 * If I could, I'd make the top bar half as tall as it is.
 * I'd try to find a way to either (A) eliminate the sidebar, or (B) make it editable. That way, regulars could maintain it. (ex: see [[http://www.communitywiki.org/en/FrontPage|the CommunityWiki SideBar,]] which [[http://www.communitywiki.org/cw?action=edit;id=SideBar|is editable]])
