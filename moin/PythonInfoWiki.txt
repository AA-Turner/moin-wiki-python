I think the most important thing, at this point, is to make this nicer.

Recommendations:

 * Replace current icons with more common images - for example, current edit icon python.org/img/moin-edit.png is hard to associate with action

--- seems like things below are related to older Wiki (feel free to delete) ---
 * If possible, make the icons text, instead of icons?
 * "Toggle Line Numbers" draws way too much attention to itself; ''Especially'' when you have only 2 or 3 lines of code! Remove it entirely, or make it much smaller, or (whatever.)
 * Bullet point items are spread too far apart. Less white space above and below them.
 * If I could, I'd make the top bar half as tall as it is.
 * I'd try to find a way to either (A) eliminate the sidebar, or (B) make it editable. That way, regulars could maintain it. (ex: see [[http://www.communitywiki.org/en/FrontPage|the CommunityWiki SideBar,]] which [[http://www.communitywiki.org/cw?action=edit;id=SideBar|is editable]])
