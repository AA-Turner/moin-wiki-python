Author of SkunkWeb.

Also recently wrote a program that can take a core dump file produced by a python interpreter and output a python stack trace.  Very useful when you have a C extension that is misbehaving and you're not sure which one it is.  Email me or the [mailto:skunkweb-list@lists.sourceforge.net SkunkWeb mailling list] if you're interested.
