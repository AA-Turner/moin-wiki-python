Add your sprint suggestion to the list below. If you intend to provide more than a brief description or have a discussion about the sprinting goals, feel free to add a new Wiki page for such purposes, using a name like `EuroPython2006/MySprint`.

 Hmm, this table says that Zope will not sprint in the next days but nevertheless they have a room ... :-)

= Sprint locations =

The sprints will take place in Building 40 in the rooms in the four "corners"
(like for the parallel sessions), on the '''ground floor''' (not downstairs!),
just a few steps ("half a stair") "above" the Cafe-area. There will be signs on the doors as 
well.

= Pre-Conference sprints =

Whoever wants to participate in a pre-conference sprint, please send a mail to 
Euro-Loc.Secretariat@cern.ch telling us so, as we need to arrange for access to the 
CERN site for the weekend (before registration). -- AndreasPfeiffer (for the local organisers)
