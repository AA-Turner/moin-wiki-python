== Sprints ==

Add your sprint suggestion to the list below. If you intend to provide more than a brief description or have a discussion about the sprinting goals, feel free to add a new Wiki page for such purposes, using a name like `EuroPython2006/MySprint`.

|| '''Group/Topic''' || '''Approx. number of people''' || '''Pre/Post EP''' || '''Room (see "Sprint locations" below)''' ||
|| [wiki:MoinMoin:EuroPython2006/Sprint MoinMoin] || Less than PyPy :-) || 6-9 July || C ||
|| ["EuroPython2006/PYxIDEsSprint"] || at least 1! || 6-9 July || C ||
|| EuroPython2006/Zope3Sprint || ? || Pre || D ||
|| EuroPython2006/PyPySprint || 15-25 || 6-9 July || B ||
|| EuroPython2006/PyPiSprint || at least 2 || 6-9 July || D (Thursday), otherwise A (except Thu from 1500-1700) ||
 Hmm, this table says that Zope will not sprint in the next days but nevertheless they have a room ... :-)

== Sprint Locations ==

The sprints will take place in Building 40 in the rooms in the four "corners"
(like for the parallel sessions), on the '''ground floor''' (not downstairs!),
just a few steps ("half a stair") "above" the Cafe-area. There will be signs on the doors as 
well.

== Pre-Conference Sprints ==

Whoever wants to participate in a pre-conference sprint, please send a mail to 
Euro-Loc.Secretariat@cern.ch telling us so, as we need to arrange for access to the 
CERN site for the weekend (before registration). -- AndreasPfeiffer (for the local organisers)
